and ladies wbo chuse to divert tbemselves in the curious arts of drawing apanning painting upon glass varuisbing up¬ on metal wood or pastboard and of taking views and prospects justly aecording to tbe rules of perspective directions for the speedy attaining the knowledge of these useful and amusing arts without giving the students the trouble of consulting large volumes wbich are generally taken from one another right or wrong or of learning seve¬ ral branches of the mathematicks as is generally thought necessary in order to understand perspective science without the knowledge of wbich it is impossible to make any great improvement in the arts of drawing or painting er even to be judge of good drawing or to understand whether one is right or wrong in what one would invent or design must confess lowe my knowledge of several valuable receipts to some manuscrips of the great mr. boyle which bave never been printed and bave fallen into my hands by means of the same noble lord bis relation whom ihave mentioned in my art of drawing and painting in water-colours iam likewise obliged to worthy gentleman who af- ter deliberate study of perspective set me to rights in few hours when lwas at any loss as far the rest they are observations srom the experiments wbich have made from time to time at à large expence and witb great industry ihave been upbraided by some workmen in cariosities for publishing receipts of value to instract the gentry in the manner of drawing and pamting and in arts of the like kind for say they it is damage to the workmen who get their livelihood by such things have short answer to this argument namely that there are none of the receipts wbich publisp but what are either my own iavention or have bought at good frice or else hade heen presented witb by people of faspion with their defire to have them made publick and these are such as would never come to the knowledge of the workmen if was not to communicate them in this manner by aubith thev bave an opportunity of improving themselves as many of them hae done from things shat bave already published in the same ways so that can say from my own certain knowledge that many of them are obliged to me and in¬ stead of complaining ought to thank me- the ettud of learning to draw in perspective yc chap which will prove of great use to all de¬ signers when observe the faults daily committed in the designing of landscapes or drawing views and prospects imore and more find and avoid such errors for understanding that art will render any one capable of drawing any thing with ma¬ so many mis but conceive that the reason why stakes are commonly made in drawings proceeds from the apprehensions that some have of the length of time it will take up to render themselves masters of perspec- tive and from being frightned at the difficulties they conceive are in that study particularly imagining that one must be first well grounded in the mathematicks this part this knew has discouraged many from engaging in the rules relating to this art but for their sakes under¬ take in this tract to instruct them in the following lessons how to lay any plan in perspective and raise pillars or buildings to due heights according to their distances lesson of the plan fig suppose we have square piece of pavement as in figure consisting of pieces of marble each foot square it must be measured exactly and laid regularly dewn upon paper you may likewise for your better observation mark every other stone or marble black which will better inform you how every particular square will appear when we have true perspective view of them or else you may number every one and when the following lesion is done number those in the perspective plan with the samefigures as are marked on the fist plan lesson of laying figure in perspective it is to be understood in perspective that there are two points so be co. sidered theifirst we caal the point of sight sight that is what relates to every thing in our view from the place where we stand and it matters little where we stand to take our view for the perspective will still be true according to the appearance of the plan to our bye lf we stand at corner or in the mid- die or at any point the method shall prescribe pre- sently will lay our plan justly before us as it will appeac the other point is called the point of distance be- cause it governs the distances and the proportions of every thing we can truly see of the plan in whatever position we happen to be at you see the plan of figure this is divided into squares as mentioned in that figure the three at the bottom marked in both and the squares in the plan marked are those which are marked in perspective with the same numbers now to lay your plan in perspective fix your point of sight as you observe in the figure or more or less to the right or left as you think proper then draw the line parallel to and at what distance you will from the line then raise line on each side from tok to form the figure you see as frame to your picture then draw line from the cor- ner which is the point of distance to and this line will regulate your work then draw lines from the squares of your plan to the point of sight as exactly as possible and wherever your line of-distanoe cuts those lines which are drawn from the squares of your plan to the point of sight that matks where your squares in perspective ought to be then draw lines parallel to the line where the line of distance cuts and that will give you the true figure of-every square so in the perspective plan answers to in the measured plan and answers to the others in the same when you have done this the next rule you are to know is how to raise either pillars trees houses or any other bodies according to their respective heights at different distances and proportion on the plan you have laid down lesson iii how to raise pillars or any bodies of certain proportion in perspective you have now your plan measured out in perspec- tive into square of foot one of these squares in this lesson serves for the base or bottom of pillar foot thick this figure iil is exactly of the same dimensions of the plan laid in perspective at figure ii first mark the line in equal proportions by the same scale of the ground plan figure ii as which are so many feet in height and they standing on the base of the first figure are up-rights not in per- spective then draw line parallel with from number which gives you the front of the body you are to raise and it is to be only three feet high draw à line cross from cto the line raised from no and that determines the height which you will then find to be foot wide and three feet high by measure then from the top of the line draw line with black- lead pencil to the point of sight and raise another line from parallel to the line till it touches the pencil ’ line passing from to the point of sight which gives you the side appearance of the column or body as you will see it from the place where you stand ithe line from point fhould be drawn with pen because it is to remain then with pencil draw line trom cto the point of sight which will determine the ether line to make the shape of the top of the column and then raise line parallel with with pencil from the ’ oint till it touches the line from cto the point of sight draw then parallel line to at and you will have the square of the top of the pillar or column as you can observe it from the place where you stand which suppose to be at iyou iust remember that the line drawn from to is only an imaginary line to be rubbed out for it can not be seen from the place where you stand and the refore must not appear in the drawing but you should not leave it out becanse it shews you where to regulate the top of your column and teaches you how to place your column upon its base with certainty by this means you may see the front and one side of your column and the line from to must also be rubbed out be- cause it can ’ be seen then finisn your column only with the lines from to from to to to and from to to it will be drawn without any imperfection and ap- pear as follows in figure iv when this is done you may place another column on any one of the squares erected in the same manner bbserving to fling your shades all on one side and then vou can not err but especially mind where the dotted lines are in figure iii when you can master these few lessons which yon may gain with very little pains you will be capable of doing any thing in this way that will be regalar and eertain and know the faults of the lgnorant and un- skilful ch ap ii of painting upon glaqs painting upon glass is an art which has ge nerally appeared so difficult that sew have succeed- ed in the attempt and yet there is no representation of any portrait can appear more elegant than in pie¬ ture done well in this manner for yon have all the softness and all the tenderness that can be desired in picture and it is easy too for any person to work upon for there are no qut-lines to draw nor any shades te make but you put on the calours without the trouble of either the pictures which we use on this occasion are those done in mezzo tinto or what we call mezzo tincto prints for their shades are rubbed down with an instru- ment on the copper-plates so that the several lines which are forced to be drawn to represent the shady part of any common print are by this means scumbled toge¬ ther and appear as soft and united as in any piece done with indian ink when you are provided with such prints as you like cut off the paper of the margin so that none be left but the print itself then take some of the finest crown-glass and have it cut exactly to the size ef your prints and when you have cleaned your glass very well lay on one side of it some fine venice turpentine a thin as possi- ble with brush made of hog ’ -hair and if you per- ceive the turpentine to lie unequally pass piece of wood made like flat ruler over it till it lies equal in every part then wet the back of your print with sponge and water and lay the pictur ’ éide upon the turpentin ’ side of the glass taking care that every part of it lies close to the glass and that there are no bub¬ bles or blisters tobe seen ’ then you may roll it over with wooden roll made like cylinder of two inches dia- meter to fix it close to the glass and when that is done wet the back of the print again with sponge and water till the paper will rub off with your fingers then rub it gently till there remains only the picture itself upon the glafs fo will you have all the lines and shades very visible as if it was sine drawing in indian ink thon let it remain till the next day to dry for else the colours would not take hecause they are ground in oil¬ sect colours for painting on glass with the neces- saries for such work at most colour-shops of note in london we may meet with colours of several forts ground in oil and tied up in little bladders to be sold at three pence groat or six pence piece according as they are more or lefs valuable of these provide as follow verditer whites prussian blue flake white white-lead sanders blue indigo tello-ws englisn pink blacks yellow oaker lamp black dutch pink lvory black yellow orpiment greens verdigrease distill ’ redt verdigreafe and yellow rose pink vermillion oaker mixt verdigrease and english red-lead pink mixt indian red verdigrease and lake dutch carminie pink mixt browns blues spanish brown uitramarine umber blue bise when you are provided with these colours you may mix them one with another to what degree of colour you think proper upon pallet with smooth knise with tender bending blade adding little more of one colour to another mixing them well till you have what you want to get the colour out of the bladders prick nole at the bottom of each bladder you design to use and press the bladder till you have colour enough upon your pallet for your present use for in day ’ time thie colours will dry and can never be recovered provide on this occasion box about two foot and half long about five inches high and sixteen incheg wide with partitions in it as follow the use of this box which is to keep all your paint- ing things together and preserve them clean fhall here very particularly explain at number must be box of tinn ’ lron no to be placed in the wooden box because it must hold oil of turpentine to clean your pencils when you have done work when you paint you must take care to use only ene pencil in colcur or in other words to have pen¬ cil for cach colour and as soon as you have dore using them for the day clean them ffom the colours by dipring them into the oil of turpentine and iying the hairy part of the pencil on the tinn ’ di- no vision between number and number your finger hard on the hair and draw it four or sive times over the tin then will the colours which which came out of the pencils fall into the tin-box number and by that means the pencils will be clean and the several mixtures of colours that fall there with their oils will become good size for gold then lay your pencils with their sticks in the box no and they will be fit sor use no time note the pencils should be of two sorts that is some of camel ’ -hair to paint with such as will ceme to point when the colour is in them and some dry brushes of white hair never to be dipp ’ in colour but used only to scumble or join one colour in another when they are just laid on so that they appear soft and you can not distinguisn where any one leaves off abrupelv you ought at least to have three dozen of camel ’ hair pencils of all sizes and dozen and half of rough brushes with sticks to cach about ten inches or foot long the sticks may be bought ready made at the co- lour-shops they are commonly made of cedar or brazil- at numb you should have case divided of wood in several parts to keep your no colours in such as carmine and ultra- marine with others that you may keep by you to grind when you want them for sometimes you may have oc- casion in the country to grind colour that you want the reafon of having divisions made in this box is to keep these colours from mixing with each other and thereby spoiling one another tor if there were no se- parate apartments sometimes in basty taking out or putting in of these colours you may disturb the papers they are commonly wrapp ’ in so much that some of the colurs will be spilled the sine or rich colours such as uitramarine or carmine may rather be bought in powder than ground in oil for the first is worth near four pounds an ounce and the carmine if ’ tis good worth about twenty shillings therefore it is better to have these in powder than to have them ground in cil at the colour-shops for by degrees they will dry though in the bladders and you will have fo much lofs from them the method to grind these in oil is to put little of either of them upon polished marble and with drop or two of oil mix them well with soft bladed knife and lay it on your pallet but of the uitrama- rine and carmine very little will serve for the least touch on the light sides of your drawing will give lustre to your picture and if it be ultramarine it will be lasting whereas have great deal of reason to sus- pect that the pruffian blue will not if it is exposed to the weather as have observed in some sign-paintings of two years standing and there find that colour to change into dirty yellow but if we mix the prussian nue with varnish it will hold and last like ultrama- rine in short the air must be kept from it to pre- serve it lf we want to grind any other colours coarser than these in their powder we must have muller which must be made of one of the hardest stones we can get and finely polisned porphyry would be the best made in the shape of sugar-loaf if one could get it but for the shape the sugar loaf figure is the easiest for any one to turn with their hand and every painter knows the way marble is good or any stone that will polish nay even glass or crystal or any such like thing but if you have great quantity of co- lour to grind you must confider that you must have large quantity of oil but never so much as to over- come the quantity of colour in the grinding part you may observe that the colour will frequently turn from under the muller then with thin knife scrape it up and place it under the muller again till ’ tis as sine as you desire it then immediately put it into piece of bladder first having the bladder immerged in warm water to soften it tie it up and let it remain to be used as have directed the others number may in its use be explain ’ thus let that partition be lined with tin or lron no because this is to enclose the bladders of oils which you should always keep by you as oil of linseed and turpentine nut-oil and burnt oil and in the taking of these in and out the apartment would be greasy and stain the wood whereas the tin will preserve it from any stain from the oils number is the middle of the box and no fhould be niade of tinn ’ lron likewise to take out and put in at pleasure for ’ tis to contain all the bladders of oiled colours and as some of them will be frequently used the reservoir for them must in time become greasy and over them is to be laid the pallet which every night after you have done your work should be cleaned of the colours you have put upon it or else covered with its colours in water to keep them useful till the next day to keep your pallet clean rub it with coarse linnen cloath with oil of turpentine and then rub it till ’ tis dry as one may call it with nut or linseed oil but take what care you will of your oil-colours in small quantities when they are exposed to the air there will be coat of thick hard scale over them in or two which indeed one may take off with knife but we lose much of the colour and some of them are very costly when vou take off the scaly part the rest of the colour is fit to use and if it is too thick then put drop or two of linseed-oil to it and mix it well with your tender knife some people when they use ultramarine and carmine because of their great price only put drop of oil on their pal- let and put as much colour to it as they think will be enough only working them together with knife which indeed is more saving than to mix it on the stone sect ii how to use the colours in painting on glass as the lines and shades of your picture happen to open so you ought to fispose your colours that is lay on the lighter colours first on the light places of your prints and the darker over the shaded places and if you have once laid on the brighter colours ’ tis no great matter whether the darker sorts are laid littie over them for the first colour laid on will hide those you lay on afterwards as for example yellows the lightest yellow may be laid on first and the dutch pink will shade it reds the red-lead may be laid on first as the brightest red colour and to shade it with lake or carmine will bring your picture to beautiful scarlet equal to any tincture of the finest dye of cochineal blues lay on first the blue bife and shade it with indigo or else take ultramarine and lay it on in the lights and shade it with indigo greens lay on first some verdigrease and then the mixture have mentioned of that and the dutch pink but you may make this green as yellow as you please by ad- ding more dutch pink as you see occasion it is to be noted that when any of these colours are too strong they may be lightened to any degree by mixing white with them upon your pallet or you may darken them by mixing them with the deeper colours but they must be well mixt with the knife before you when you have painted your glass it must stand three or four days before it will be dry enough to put in frame chap iii of the making of crayons sor dry colouring the use of crayons for dry colours is so neces- sary in taking of views and prospects and there are so few crayons that are good of the sort that think think the way of making them necessary article to be known to every one who is lover of drawing and painting white as for white we have no occasion of any other than white soft chalk which should be sawed into lengths of an inch and half or two inches there are litile saws made on purpose for such uses about four inches long and very thin when you have saw ’ out your crayons of chalk which should be at most quarter of an inch thick round off the corners with penknife and point them by drawing your penknife upwards from the place where the point is to be you pught to have dozen or two of these to lie in little case by themselves or they will be discoloured by the other co- lours yellow pastils or crayons yellous come next which should be divided into four or five degrees of colour first take fome grounds of starch and flour of brimstone mix them well with knife upon polishied marble so that they produce the colour of straw or yellow as faintly will shew itself then pour little milk to them or little pale ale wort till the colour become like paste then spread the paste on fmooth piece of chalk with broad knife till it is about the third part of an inch thick and let it lie till ’ tis half dry then with sharp knife cut it in lengths of an inch and half about the fourth part of an inch wide and roll it thin between two little pieces of board till they are round like straw and point them as have directed for the chalk you please you may use ground chalk instead of grounds of starch yelloew it is made of yellow oker ground well with fair water and then dried and beat mix this with ground chalk in sach quantity as it will be àa little deeper than the former colour and mix them up with pale ale wort in which little white sugar-candy may be dissolved and make these crayons as the former grind yellow oker with water with stone and muller and when ’ tis dry beat it very fine and make it into pastils or crayons with pale ale- wort or size made with glovers leather boiled in water till it comes to jelly use it as before directed and roll the pastils between two boards yellow take english pink grind it as the former with water and when ’ tis dry beat it fine and mix it with very little ground chalk till ’ tis deeper than the former colour then put to it some wort of pale ale and stir all well together and make it into pastils or crayons by rolling in the foregoing manner fellow english pink is to be alone ground as the former and to be made in pastils or crayons by itself with pale ale wort yellow dutch pink is to be used as the former and mixt with pale ale-wort or milk and so rolled and dried yellow orpiment is one of the most poisonous colours that can be used however it is one of the most beautiful sort and is next orange colour this must have little ground chalk mixt with it well tem- pered together and made up with pale ale-wort with little gum dragon dissolved in it and roll them up into pastils as you did the former orange colours orange-colour take yellow orpiment mix it with pale ale-wort and when it is in paste roll it and make it into pastils or crayons orange-colour take orpiment and red-lead but the red-lead must be very finely ground in water and dried then mix little of this with your orpiment tiil you have the colour you desire and putting to it some ale wort wherein some gum-dragon has been dissol- ved make it into paste and roll it into pastils or crayons orange-colour take english pink grind it well and put to it as much vermillion as will make it of the colour you desire mix these up with ale wort that has been boiled till ’ tis more glutinons than ordinary and make it into pastils as before directed atb orange colour take english pink finely ground and put to it as much red lead well ground as will make it agreeable to your design mix these well with ale wort boiled to thickness and make them into crayons sth orange coloar take some dutch pink grind it well and mix with it some red-lead finely powdered to the colour you want then make this into paste with ale-wort or milk and roll it up into crayons as before directed note in the mixture of these colours observe that they have as many different shades as possible reds st red take red-lead grind it well with water then dry it and beat it to sine powder and put to it some chalk or white lead finely ground to brighten it mix this with ale- wort wherein little gum-dragon has beën boiled make it into paste and roll it into crayona in this you should make some of your pastils deeper others paler red take red lead and when ’ tis well ground with marble and muller make it into paste with ale wort wherein gum dragon has been boiled red red oker wants no preparation but sawing as have directed for chalk in the first article red take vermillion grind it fine and mix pulverized divide your composition into three parts and by adding moreof the white to one than another make three different colours then put to each ale wort boiled thick and make them severally into paste and so into crayons stb red take vermillion well ground and mix it with ale wort that has been boiled to thickness with red take some good lake grind it well with water upon marble and when it is well dried and powdered lay it in three divisions and mix with each as much ground chalk or white-lead as will make them of several colours then make them severally in- to paste and then into crayons red take sine lake and reduce it to as fine powder as you can with water and when it is dry and again finely powdered mix it with ale-wort and make it into pastils or crayons red take indian red grind it well with wa- ter and dry it like the other colours then mix it with ale-wort that has been boiled to thickness with little gum dragon this alone will be very-strong colour but you should mix some of it with white in two or three different manners to be shades to one another red take rose-pink and cut it into the shape of crayons without any preparation carmine is too dear for them for twelve penny-worth would make but small crayon purples purple take rose-pink finely ground and pory- dered mix it well with little sanders blae till the powder appears of the colour you want then make it into paste with ale-wort thickned with gum dragon and roll them into the figure of crayons purple take lake finely ground and washed put to it as much blue bise as you think proper to make it of reddish purple and you should vary this in two or three manners each lighter than the other in the lighter sorts put à sufficient quantity of chalk or white lead well ground and mix them up with ale- wort boiled to thickness with gum dragon and roll them into pastils purple take some lake well ground and add to it as much prussian-blue as will make it of the co- lour you desire mix these very well together in several parcels making some more inclining to red than the ¬ thera and to the faintest purple of them add some ground chalk at your pleasure and make these severally into paste with ale wort thickened by boiling so make them after the same manner as the former into pastils blues blues blue blue bise is the lightest blue colour we use and must be well ground with common water on fine marble then let it dry and reduce it again to powder then lay it in four parcels and pat to three of them in different proportions some ground chalk or white- lead so that when they come to be mixt every one may be lighter than the other mix these soparately with ale-wort that is thickened with scraps of glovers lea¬ ther and when they are in pafte to your mind make them- into crayons and the fourth part of the blue bise must be made up by itself in the same manner bluc take verditer well ground on fine marble lay it in four parcels and mix one of them purely with thin size made of white glovers shreds and ale-wort and the other three parts mix with several proportions of ground chalk or white-lead well ground so as to make shades to one another make these into pafte with ale-wort thickened with gum-dragon and fo in¬ to crayons blue take some pruffian-blue and grind it well then lay it in four parcels on your marble and mix with three of them some ground chalk or white lead well ground to make them of different degrees of colour and the fourth part must be alone make the three mixed colours into paste with pale ale-wort boiled till it thickens and the plain colour must be made into paste with some ale wort boiled and thickened with white shavings of leather from the glovers make all these into crayons blue take rock irdigo and grind it well with water on marble dry it and powder it again and then divide it in parcels as is directed above and with two or three parts of them mix different proportions of ground chalk or white-lead ground to make them paler or deeper and one part must be the simple co- lour put to the mixt colours some ale wort thick- ened with boiling and mix them to paftes then roll them into crayons as for the plain indigo mix it with ale-wort thick- ened with glovers shreds of white leather by boiling and make it into pastils blacks black the black which is commonly used as crayon is charcole cut into lengths the softest and best is that which is made of willow have at least dozen or two of these for black and white are used great deal more than any other colour black take lvory black ground very sine with common water and put to it very little ground in- digo for blueisn cast will enliven your black and help it from that deadness which plain black always carries with it browns brown take for light brown some fullers- earth grind it well with water and mix it with some ground chalk or white-lead to make it in different colours that is to make it lighter as you think fit mix this up with pale ale-wort boiled thick and at least have four sorts of it brown take some spanish browii grind it very well and mix with it some fullers-earth to make it lighter for the spanish-brown is dark colour of it¬ self and when you have made this mixture you may put to some part of it little white chalk ground or white-lead in different proportions to have them of various shades these are for the lighter browns and mix them severally in pastes with light size of fisn- glue or isinglass and water and some of them with pale ale wort boiled thin or thick water gruel boiled with gum dragon then make them into pastils brown take spanish brown well ground and some indian-red mix them well together and put to them some pale ale-wort till they become paste you may make some of them lighter if you will with ground chalk or white-lead and then roll them into crayons green take some verdigrease and boil it in sharp vinegar and add to it when it boils little tartar powdered which will dissolve the verdigrease so that the liquor will be of finc colour then set the li- quor in little gallipots exposed to the air which will dry the colour and then it will dissolve in common water this may be taken with just as much warm ale-wort as will cover it and will dissolve the green then make it into pastils with white chalk ground as much as you think proper green grind distilled verdigrease with vinegar on marble wasn it well with water the manner of which is to throw the verdigrease into water and in half minute to pour off the water into cup and let it settle then pour the water from it and wash it again in the same way when this is dry make it into crayons with ale wort green take verdigrease prepared as before fine- ly powdered and mix it with little prussian blue in se- veral proportions in the lightest sorts put little white or the brightest yellow well ground to make varieties of colour mix all these with pale ale wort boiled to thickness atb green take some indigo well ground and some english-pink mix them well together upon marble and when they are well powdered make them into paste and roll them up with foft size and oil till they are of the figure of crayons or with pale ale- wort or thick water-gruel but when we use water- gruel it must be strained and boiled with some gum- dragon green take some blue bise ground fine and put to it some dutch pink well ground mix them in par- cels and prepare them in snades to one another then make them into pastes and roll them into crayons you may have five or six varieties of these nore the liquid which you are to use to make them into pastils must be ale-wort boiled little thick green grind rock-indigo very sine with water on marble and when ’ tis dry beat it fine again then lay it in parcels on the marble and put to some of them little slower of brimstone in greater or lesser quantities and to others slower of brimstone and dutch pink mixt so that you may have variety of colours when these different shades are as you intend them then make them into pastes with ale wort thickned by boiling with white glovers leather-shreds or with little gum- dragon green grind some rock-indigo with water and add to it in several parcels as much dutch pink as you see convenient to make your greens of various shades when these are well mixt put to them some ale-wort thickened by boiling and make them into pastes and when they will roll make them into cray- ons memorandum the reason why these crayons are better than commonly those which are bought at the shops is because they are generally made too stiff with guis and so will hardly touch the paper but ah these will work freely and express the several colours you dofire we must consider that the reason why we make five or six shades of each colour is because in this case we can not mix any when we use them whereas in oil- painting and painting in water colours we may make what mixtures we please in an instant and when we set about any painting or drawing in crayons which happens to have great variety of colours in it we ought not to be without every sort of colour that can be thought on note these colours should be kept in box partitioned every sort by itself wiz the white vellows lay the brightest sorts in one and the deep- er sorts in another till you come towards the orange- colours orange-colours the lighter sorts of orange-colours in an apartment and the deeper in another reds paler sorts or fleffi-colours in one apart- ment the brighter reds in another the stronger reds in another and the deepest reds in another every one with its proper shades till we come towards purple purples the paler sorts inclining to red in one apart- ment the next sorts more inclining to blue in another with their shades and these which are next to blus with their shades in part by themselves blues should follow the purples put the lightest pre- parations in the first apartment the next degree into another third into another and the fourth to the last into others but keep the prussian blue quite by itself and its mixtures by themselves it serves very well in this way to supply the place of ultramarine and as it is much cheaper forbear to mention the use of ule- tramarine blue in this case which is extravagant in the price for crayon of it could not be made under half guinea and besides in this way of crayon draw- ing the preparation of prussian-blue does very well an- swer the same end though that colour will not do in water-colours nor even last in oil-colours if it comes to be exposed to the weather for in either case it changes to dirty yellow-colour but find that the crayons hold by being imbodied as have directed reens should be divided intp three or four sorts and with their shades be laid in several apartments browns should be likewise put in three or tour par- cels with their proper shades to be laid in each partment of one great box and you should never be without crayons of charcole in another case with all these you will be compleatly furnished and when you go out to take any view have one of every sort in little box divided as the foregoing to carry in your pocket the paper which you should use on this occasion should be venice rough paper almost like our whited brown paper or even the whited brown paper which they sell at every chandlers shop the stiffer it is th bet- ter that which they call cap paper is the best as have found by experience for upon such the colours easily distribute themselves and by this means every one may take figures in their proper colours as they see them tor they may match the colours as they appear with the crayons they have by them and as the cray- ons are dry they will not alter their colour but the wet- ted colours will appear deeper when they are wet than when they are dry which will deceive the eye of be ginner instructions for the use of crayons remember when vou use these crayons that yon point them from the bottom upwards and make not the points too sharp unless in the white chalk the red oker and the charcole one may make pretty drawing on blue paper with only chalk and charcole the strong lights and the dark shades make fine contrast and pleasant appearance in drawing chap iv curious directions for drawing with cray- ons the manner of drawing with crayons is much more expeditious where we would express the objects we are to take in colours than painting in wa- ter-colours for before we use them to strike the co- lours we intend only slight out-line need be made ei¬ ther with chalk charcoal of red oker of the subject we would represent we may bring these drawings to delicate softness and fine expression but then they mustbe always kept in books or under glasses of frames where they may not rub for touch of rude finger unacquainted with the performance may change the shades or lights and so alter the sine design of the work but we must first provide an indifferent coarsé paper of the colour of whited brown paper fer the colour of the paper being à little dark gives better opportunity of of shewing thet light or white strokes of our crayons and will give good relief to the tender parts of our work again the little roughaess of such paper will make the crayons of every colour express themselves muck stronger than if we were to draw with them upon smooth paper these crayons of every sort of colour you will have occasion for are made in pastils and sold by most of the most noted colour-men in london few will serve you at first to try your hand and in taking off sketshes of prospects are very usefal when you are once master of dzawing enough to take the out-lines for little box of them will serve to mark the colours which you will remark in the different parts of your prospect without the trouble of water and gum-water which must be had if we use water-colours and would be troublesome te get for your use in the fields where you should take these prospects from these crayons being of so easy use may encou- rage us to colour our prospects after the life where we shall discouer the different colours of the several fielde which are very different from one another according ae tkey happen to be cropp ’ or fituated and then the woods which are in view commonly consist of variety of trées which have every one of them their different colour which at once we may see in our crayons and mark it as it happens to be upon our drawing but if our wood should prove all of one sort of tree we shall sfill find great variety of colours in the trees produ- ced by their different situation and if we match our crayons well with the colours of our trees and other parts of the-prospect we shall learn by it what is na- tural representation of things but to do this effectually if you can not furnish draught in colourat once take the same hour the next day to do it in because as the sun happens to beat one point at one hour of the day so the next day it will be about the same point at the fame hour and if you was to mifs that time the shades of all your objects will be altered and- your colours will be vary ’ so you should likewise take either the mornings or evenings for this purpose for then you will have strong shades and strong lights which will give pleasing variety to your picture.. memorandum if you have bright morning or evening when yon begin finisn your work when the hours of your drawing are as bright as they were at first if you can for want of such observations many one who is good draughts man spoils five drawing he will some- times place his greens improperly and give strengthe where only little touches should be us ’ and some who are beginners in these affairs will encourage fa- vourite colour and neglect the proper ornamental co- lours think have not seen finer prospects to teach us this art than what are on both sides guilford dowyns box-bill leith bill ricbmond-bill and about high wick- bam where one has fine vales beautiful hills and de- lightful woods in the spring and autumn to look on the woods you may almost perceive every colour in our collection some.trees will open with yellowish cast others with sharp blueisn green some brown and others of reddisni colour and so in the dying away of the leaves in autumn or towards the fall of the leaf vou will see as much variety and you will find then the fields and all the change¬ able parts of the country of different colours about half score drawings in crayons of these sorts will enliven your imagination and teach you the art of co- louring in the most natural and consequently the most beautiiul manner but if you design principally to draw landscapes in this manner advise to make ydur qut-lines with- charcoal or black-lead very gently touchd but biack lead is the best when in this way of drawing one has an object where à light colour and shaded colour should fall na¬ turally into ane anothier then when you have mark' yoat paper with both take dry short hair ’ pencile and brushit gently between both ’ till you have mixt- them so easily together that you can not discern where the lights and the shades separate or where the light and the shade part from one another but this is pra- perly for the larger drawings which are to appear soft and tender if one wants fencil of the fort speak of take piece of soft whited brown paper and roll it or twist it up till ’ tis of the bigness of camel ’ hair pencil of the size we generally use in water-colours and when you have rubb ’ the pointed end gently on rough piece of clean board or piece of rough brown paper twill serve instead of pencil to ’ scumble your work or make one colour flow into another there remains now only to tell you how you ought in this particular way of drawing to cut or point your crayons take fine penknife and instead of drawing it down from the body of the crayon towards the point as one does in pointing black-lead pencil begin at the point and draw your knife upwards in such manner as to leave your crayon of the same fi- gure you would require black-lead pencil to be of when ’ twas sharpen ’ for these crayons are hardly two inches long and are brittle enough besides if they have any knots in them they will be very apt to break one may observe too before we conclude this chap- ter of drawing and colouring with crayons that all these appear immediately of the colour one would express whereas the colours to be us ’ with water will be mach deeper or darker when the water is put to them than they will prove when they are dry which may confound beginner and occasion him to make his colour lighter but when this comes to dry he will see his error « scumbling is rubbing in gently one colour into apothen chap concarning the manner of etching or hetching to be done witb aqua-fortis on copper-plates your copper plates must be very smooth and poished on one side as they are done for the en¬ gravers then make varnisn of petrolium bees- wax and turpentine melted together in glazed earthen-vefsel when it is cold put it into piece of mantua silk and tye it up then warm the backside of the plate over some hot small-coal dust and pafs the silk with the mixture in it over the fore-side of the plate till ’ tis all covered after this hold the varnished part of the plate over the smoke of candle moving it backwards and forwards till ’ tis all equally blacked you must next take your drawing or print and rub the back of it with chalk or red oker but chalk is the best and when the back of this drawing is rub- bed little with woollen cloth lay the chalk part of the print upon the varniss and sixing it well draw over all the strokes with blunt pointed needle mark- ing it as you go along the shades so you will have all the lines marked upon your varnish then provide four or five needles of different sizes and with the finest make the finer lines apd so by de- grees on to the larger tracing them over the varnish upon the lines of the drawing till they touch the cop- per plate and to prevent your rubbing out any of thg chalk-lines you must have an even piece of wood sup- ported by two bits to move before you and to rest your hand upon when this is done make your shades and when they are done border round the plate some green wax which being put in warm water will become soft and then pour on aquafortis with third part of water and when you think the aguafortis has eaten deep enough in the light part pour off your water and wasn the plate with common water dry it and with pencil of camel ’ hair paint over the lightest parts with common varnisn then pour on again your aqua- fortis and let it eat into the copper iitt ’ more and when you think that ’ enough use the piate as you did before and so on to the last then take off your green wax and varnissi by warming the piate as you did at first and ciean the plate with coarse piece of linen without any thing in it that may scratch the plate when this is done you may have your plate touched up with graver or you may send it to the rolling prefs for proof and then the engraver can see best what sharpnes or amendments

co- lours in japan the people have method of making bowls plates and other vessels of brown ’ aper and sometimes of sine saw dust these vessels are very light and very strong when they come to be varnished and are in great esteem among us the method of making such utensils shall here disclose take slips of brown paper boil them in common water mashing it with stick while it boils till ’ tis almost become paste then take it from the water and beat it well in mortar till ’ tis so reduced as the rags are in paper-mill then make strong gum-wa¬ ter with gum arabick and common water quantity sufficient to cover your paper-paste an inch put these together into glazed pipkin and let them boil stirring them very well till you think the paper-paste is im- pregnated with the gum then have ready your mould to give your paste the figure you design for it- the mould is made as follows for example suppose you design to make any thing of the figure of plate have hard piece of wood turned on one side of such figure and make hole or two in the middle quite through the wood iyou mast observe this mould mast be like the back of plate when this is done tuin another hard piece of wood of the same figure about the eighth part of an inch less than the former but about the rim or edge vou may have some little ornament carved or ingraved in the wood when these moulds are made oil them very well on the turned sides and continue to do so till they are well soaked with oil then they wilk be fit for use when you go to make your plate of the paper- paste take the mould with the hole in it and oil it fresn set it even upon strong table and spreed over it some of your pafte as equally as possible so as to be in every part about quarter of an inch thick then oik the other mould very well and set it as exactly as may be on your laste and press it hard down then put great weight upon it and let it remain twenty four hours the hole at the bottom is for the water to pass through that is pressed out of the paste and the oiling of the moulds is to prevent the gummed paste from sticking to the wood when you perceive the paste dry it will be as hard as board and fit to lay ground upon made with strong size and lamp black letting it dry gently and when that is dried throughly then take some lvory black finely ground and mixit with the fol¬ lowing varnish sect to make the strong japan-varniss take half an ounce of colophony melt it in glazedt fipkin then sprinkle into it by degrees an ounce and half of amber finely beaten and sifted stiring it well now and then adding some spirit of turpentine when this is melted then sprinkle in an ounce and half of sarcacola finely beaten stirring it all the while and put¬ ting frequently more spirit of turpentine till all is melted then pour it through coarse hair bag placed between two hot boards and press it gently till the clear is received into glazed warm vessel with this varnishi mix your ground lvory black and warming first your paper-'ate paint it on before fire in warm room as equally as you can and set it in gentle ¬ ven then the next day put it in hotter oven and the third day into one very hot and let it stand till the oven is quite cold and then it will be fit for any use either with liquors that are cold or hot and will never change and ’ tis with great difficalty you can break them am of opinion that if the moulds were cast in any hard metal they would do as well as if they were turned in wood sect ii of making these china-toys of the ce- lour of gold prepare your bowls plates or any other vessel in the same manner as the former or you may take fine saw-dust if you can have it and dry it well then pour on it some turpentine melted with an equal quantity of rezin and half as much bees-wax mix them well and put to them your dry saw-durt stirring all together till the mixture becomes thick as pxlle then take it off the fire and warm your moulds and spread some of your mixture on that with the hole in the middle as equally as possible and press down the mould upon it then set it to cool and your vessel will be fi for paint- you may put into this when your turpentine is ing melted some sarcacoa finely powdered to the quan- tity of half the turpentine stirring it well and it will harden it and yos oaght to make this compofition in the epen air for it wil endanger your house- but which ever of the mixtures you use if you have mind to have them appear like gold paint them over with size and when that begins to stick little to the figure lay on leaf-gold either pure or that sert which is brought to us from germany but- the last is apt to change green as most ef the preparations of brass will do such as those which are called batb-metal and others of the like sort which appear like gold when they are not frestr polished or cleaned every day but as the air coming upon them will make them alter to an ngly colour so ehuse gold which is durable and will never change and à mach siner colour than any of the former for continuance but though- the leaf- gold we are to use is tender and ’ may be lubject to rub eff off yet the varniss we shall put over it will keep it bright and entire when the gold is laid on and the flying pieces brushed off which must be done when the gold-size is dry then apply the following varnish to brighten the gold and preserve it from rubbing sect iii varnist for gold or such leof of me- tals as imitate gold take some colophony melt it and then put in two ounces of amber well pulverized with some spirit of turpentine as the amber thickens

cut ont of prints as little sprigs of flowers or such like and uhen they are dry paint them over with gold size and let that remain till ’ tis little sticking to the touch then lay on your gold and let that be well closed to the gold size and dried then if you would shade any part of vyour flower take some ox gall and with sine camels hair pencil trace over the shady parts on the leaf-gold and upon that paint with deep dutch- pink and when that is dry use your varnisn in warm place mean that varnisn directed for the co- vering of gold and set it to harden by degrees in an oven which varnish

fiery colours in your paintings bect ix the method of glaxing prints witb white varnisp so as to bear water and the polisb it is best in this way first to pafte your print on board or piece of shock-eloth strained on frame to do this well prepare some stiff starch and with sponge dipt in water or thin starch wet the back of your print and if you design to lay it on board dip large brushi in the thick starch and brushi it over the board as even as possible and let it dry then second time repeat the same work and so continue till the veins or grain of the wood is quite silled in the last operation when the starch is just laid on lay upon it your wet print as equally as possible so that there ap- pear no bubbles in it press it close every where till it lies fmooth and fo let it dry in this operation your hands must be very clean or else you will foil the print in bout twenty four hours it will be dry enough to varnisti with the following viz wbite varnisb for prints take of letbyocolla or lfinglajs or fisp-glue as some- call it four ounces and pull it into small pieces seethe this slowly in quart of brandy or strong spirits in glazed pipkin and when by takingout little you find it will make strong glue by being little exposed to the air it will do for your purpose but be sure to make it as strong as you can and while it is warm with brusni wash over the print as quick as possible and as smooth as may be let-this stand 'day and theu brush it over again with the same varnissi or glue and let it dry very well then brush it over with white varnissi at such distance from the fire that it may not be too hot or else it will blister and do this two or three times over then set it by for day or two and brush it over with white varnish again three or four times and let it stand day or two then varnish it third time with two or three passages of the brush and in three or four days polish it with soft linnen-cloth and some fine tripoli rubbing it very gently till it remains as smooth as possible and clear it with flour and oil it will then appear as bright as chrystal and if it should at any time be annoyed by flies you may wasn it with sponge and water which will clean it note for common ule some first dissolve the isinglass in warm water lest it should take fire the white varnish take gum sandarick of the clearest and whitest sort one pound gum-mastick of the clearst sort one ounce gum sarcacolla the whitest one ounce and half venice- turpentine three ounces benzoin the clearest half an ounce white rezin half an ounce gum animæ an ounce and half gum-elemi ounces these must be dissolved and mixt in the following manner put your sarcacolla and rezin into little more spi- rits than will cover them to dissolve then put your gum-animæ benzoin and venice turpentine into glass or glazed vessel and pour on as much spirit as will cover them an inch then provide glazed vessel or glass for your gum mastick and sandarick and pour on them strong spirits enough to cover them about an inen to dissolve them rightly then in distinct ves- sel of the- same sort as before put your gum elimi and cover it with spirits to dissolve iin this procefs you need only pulverize the gums animæe sarcacolla and benzoin and you may break the rezin little while these are dissolving for three or four days shake the bot- tles twice or three each day then put all these together in glazed vessel gently warm ’ stiring them well and strain the liquor and gums gently beginning with the gums through linnen-cloth this will prevent any dirt getting into your varn sn then put it into bottle and let it stand week before you nse it and pour off as much of the clear only as you think you shall want for present use take care of fire to paste prints upen clotb for varuisbing if you put'your print upon shock-cloth well strained in frame brufh over your cloth with strong paste made with flour and water and immediately brush over the back of your print with well prepared starch and then as readily brusn the cloth over again with the same starch and lay on your print as equally as poffible without letting any bubbles or blisters appear in the pa- per but you must observe that when you lay on your paper apon the clotb as both the cloth and the paper are then wet however close you lay the paper to the cloth they will both together appear flagging and un- strained yet as soon as they are dry all will be smooth as either was at the first let them remain so in dry warm place for day or two and then varnisn your print as before directed with glue made of scthyocol- la and then with the white varnisn with this varnish you may mix up any colour that has been ground dry upon marble and paint with it upon any figure you have drawn or upon any print yon have pasted upon your work but the varnisned colours what colours are proper shades to one another see the- chapter for making of crayons varnish made witb seed- lacca put quart of strong spirit into large glass vessel and put to it six ounces of seed-lacca let these stand together two days shaking them often then take jelly bag or flannel bag made like what is called hippocrates ’ sleeve and pass it through letting the li- quor drop into receiver and squeezing the gums every now and then when the varnish is almost out of the bag add more and press it gently till all is strain- ed and the dregs remain dry take care you do not fire for fear you set your house put this dross into the in flame then putit in bottles and keep them close stopt setting it by till you perceive all the thick parts settled to the bottom which will be in three or four days then pour off the clear into frefh bottle and twill be fit for use as for the varnish made of shell-lacca ’ tis not of any great service though often recommended for it will not bear the polisn when you lay on your varnishes take the following method lf you varniss wood let your wood be very smooth close grained free from grease and rubbed with rushies lay on your colours as smooth as possible and if the varnisn has any blisters in it take them off by with rushies when you varnish keep your work warm but not too hot in laying on of your varnish begin in the middle and stroke the brusn to the outside then to another extreme part and so on till all is covéred for the brushi if you was to beginat the edges would leave blots there and make the-work unequal in sine works use the finest tripoli to polisn do not polisn your work at one time but after the first polishing let it dry two or three days and poliss again for the last time in the first polishing you must ase good deal of tripoli but in the next avery little will serve wash off your tripoli with sponge and water dry your varnish with dry linnen rag and clear your work with oil whiting and lamp-black sect to take off the figure from auy piece ef china-ware though the person bas not been acquainted with drawing when you have any figures to your liking upon any china dish cup plate or such like you must lay piece of oiled paper over them so as to hold the piece steady till ’ you can trace our the lines of the figures then lay the oiled paper on paper blacked on one side and the blacked paper on clean paper then trace the lines with pen or blunted point of needle till the lines are all impressed on the white paper and draw them over with black lead pencil and mark the shades where they separate from the light parts of the colour that so you may lay on your colours as you see them painted on the china-ware then cut out your fi- gures close to the qut lines and fix them upon your ground of whiting and size or size with ground chalk with thick gum arabick and water and when they are quite dry paint them the lighter parts in water- colours and the shady parts with varnishi mixed with the darker colours when these are dry wasn all over with the white varnisn before fire but not so hot as to make the varnisni rise in blisters when the varnish is dry lacker-it again with the same varniffi and repeat it third time then scrape some tripoli very fine and with soft rag dipt in water take up little of the tripoli at time and polish it by gentle rub- bing till ’ tis smooth then waffi off the tripoli with soft sponge and water and then with dry fine cloth wipe off the tripoli and when that is dry dean it with whiting and oil if it is white var- nissi or with oil and lamp black where the varniss is black but the common way is to cut out prints and pafte them on such parts as we think fit and then colour them with water-colours and varnisni them with white varnish is an easy way of painting because the shades of the prints when you lay on transparent water colour will give the light and shade that colour to your purpose without using dark and light colour sect xi some remarkable directions in coloaring of draughts or prints in japanning as flowers birds fruits if vou have prints or drawings in black and white of flowers if the centre of the flower is rising just touch the edges of the lights with thin tincture of gamboge and lay on some dutch pink or gall-stone over the shades so as to run into the lights very lit- tle say this because the thrums in the middie of flowers are generally yellow but if of any other co lour as by observation find they are sometimes blue sometimes more light and sometimes darker then touch on the verges of the lights little ultramarine-blue and over the shades either some sanders blue to run very little into the uitramarine or else snade with in- digo and some of the white of the print being left void of colour will then give à life and spirit to the colours so disposed all flowers should be tenderly touched in the lights just to give à little glare into the light parts of the co- lour you would give to the flower-leaves and if you have natural flower to paint by you will presently see that on the shady side you must lay on the most shady part such colour as will ’ force the reft to appear for- ward but do not dawb over the shades with too hea vy colour let it be such as may be transparent if possi¬ ble and scumble it into the light colour which was laid on before use your pencil lightly on this occafion with very little gum water in it and use it before the colours are quite dry in the painting of the leaves of herbs or plants we ought to have regard to the colours of the greens the brightest is the verdigrease green described in my former book relatiug to painting in water-colours we fnould touch that colour little into the light parts of the leaf from the place where the lighter parts of the shades end and then lay on some sap green on the shady parts so as to unite with the verdigrease-green and if the na- tural leaf should be of darkisn colour touch the lighter sides of the leaves with little verdigrease- green and dutch yellow pink mixt together or with tincture of french berries but so as to let the verdi- grease shine more than the pink and by degrees shade it with pink the leaving the lights when we colour print has two advantages viz if we leave the lights on this occasion the white- ness of the paper serves instead of the use of white paint which is an heavy colour and would rather con- found the edges of the colours which have prescrib- ed to be laid on than do them any service but the colours which have directed where there is no white laid on will agreeably shine into the white of tne pa- per am more particular in this because several if they see flower of blue colour will lay it all over with one colour though it is-thick enough to hide both the lights and the shades and then it remains like penny picture where there is nothing to be seen but jargon of reds blues and yellows with little practice of what direct you will soon see the good effect of laying on colours for this use though the dawbing of prints in the common manner may please the lgnorant when every one of taste will soon discover the impertinence in word when you are about such pieces of work scumble the lights into the shades of every colour and save the middle of the lights open on the papers for as the paper is white of itself it makes à light chap viii to melt amber and cast it into any figure with flies or any small animals in it as we see in the valuable pieces of amber sold at great prices from mr. boyle take turpentine and melt it in glass in strong sand heat where the fire may be raised at discretion then have prepared three ounces of amber either of the whitest or yellow fort il you want your amber white pick out the clearest white pieces or if yellow the clearest of that sort levigate either of them and when your turpentine is melted sprinkle the pow- dered amber in keeping it stiring with piece of fir- wood till you find no resistance then if you find your melting to resist the stick drop in by degrees à little venice turpentine and keep it still stirring till all your powdered amber is dissolved and is thick enough to pour into moulds and when ’ tis cool you will have fi- gure or the medal you propose silled with it and re- main as hard as amber itself with all the same qualities that amber commonly

the drawing and painting water-colours chap rules for drawing any object in its outlines as exact as the life or nature take sheet of the thinnest or whitest brown paper and brush it over with oil of turpen tine which will immediately render it transpa rent and then put the paper to dry in the air when tis dry strain it upon frame and six it against any- object you design to draw as an house or hill or tree then just belore it place piece of wood with an hole in it fit for one eye to look through and as you meet any out-lines of the object you desire up- on the transparent paper trace them over with pencil so will you be sure that you can not err for there will be nothing but just proportion and true representati- on of nature to make this still of more elegancy observe the tracing of your draughts where the shades are and mark them with your pencil for all the art in the world can never dispose the shades so regularly as one may touch by this method but the shades must be done quickly after the qut lines are drawn and not at dif- ferent times because every instant the sun changes them in this too observe that in certain objects you will have fainter stronger and yet more dark shades and in yoar remarks of them take such memorandums as may direct you how to finish them with indian ink or other colour when you sit down to compleat yout work the best way that know is to prepare three shells or gallipots of indian ink mix ’ with common water before you attempt to trace out your object viz one of very faint black the next of middling black and the other of an interse black number them from the lightest to the darkest and as ygu make your observations of the shades on your object mark upon your draught the same numbers as they happen to appear so that afterwards you may finisn with certainty again it is neceffary in the drawing of any thing after this manner to observe that the lines on the sha- dy side should be thick or bold and those on the lighter sides should be thinner or finer in proportion to the light that falls upon them as for example in the darkest part 'line may be of this thickness in the next dark part somewhat thinner and it the other thus unless in things at great distane hardly to be understood or so faint as hardly to be perceived thus mere shadow as it were some have been guilty of great fault though they have taken the qut lines very exact to make all their lines of an equal thickness lf an object be reprsented we ’ ll suppose two miles off and the drawing be as strong in that part of the picture as if it was next the eye or not ten or twenty feet from the draughtsmian it would not appear plea- sant or natural to the eye we must not express man wich buttons on his coat at two miles distance no more than we must have them ommitted in person so near the eye as ten or twenty feet though this has inadvertently been done by some who have passed for great men and the shades in those distant appearan- ces must be in proportion to the strength of the ob- jects as they appear to us imperfect three or four well-directed touches of the pencil on the shady side will represent figure at the distance we can dis- cern it as lively as some hundreds will of the same fi- gure near the eye but the transparent paper speak of is of another use for if we lay it upon any picture or print in loose sheet you will see all the lines through it and may then draw or copy it with the greatest pleasure you will then if the print or picture be done by good master see which lines are strong and which aze ten- der and soft imitate them there is yet another way to take views and lande scapes which some prefer to the transparent paper that is either with white or black tiffany or lawn strain ’ upon frame and us ’ in the same manner as the paper exceptingthat the black-lead pencil is used to the paper on the white tiffany and on the lawn we use charcoal finely poinied and very soft but on the black tiffany we use white chalk of the tenderest fort chap ii how to bring these drawings to use and te copy from prints paintings if we make drawing upon transparent paper t drawing from it regularly get piece of pa- per of the same size and rub on one side of it some powder of black lead till ’ tis well and equally black and so well rubbed that touch of finger will hardly be tinged with it then take the drawing you have made or print and day the black paper under it with the black side down- wards upon piece of white paper and pin the three together in two or three places take then pin or needle à little blunt at the point and trace it over the out-lines of your picture which with little pres- sing will direct the black ’ paper to impress the un- dermost white paper so as to receive every stroke yon draw when this is done you must with your black lead pencil correct what errors you find and slightly clean the draught new made with some stale bread crumbs the black-lead pencil is so hard to be found tolerable that know not above one place where we can get one that will do the service we require if we find good piece of lead in the beginning when we have used an inch or two the rest generally proves hard gritty and full of knots the best have met with are commonly sold by joy- ners from some of these one may have them of soft or hard lead and use them till they are reduced to two or three inches tis great pleasure to draughtsman to work with good pencil and as great à plague to have bad one so the camel ’ hair brushes are generally very bad they are indeed cheap enough to buy them in common but if one would have the best which should be full of hair the price ought to be accordingly as they can be made to hold quantity of colour and be brought to fine ’ oints 'lis better to give six pence or fhilling for pencil than to have dozen for groat as for the draughts drawn on tiffany or lawn lay them only on paper that which is drawn with charcoal upon white paper and that drawn with chalk on black or blue paper then giving each of them knock or two with an hammer the charcoal or the chalk will fall through them upon the papers directly in the lines they were drawn and give you the true representation of the object you drew from the life upon the black paper you will see it in white lines and so the contrary then strengthen these shadows of drawings with your black lead pencil or chalk or red oker on the sheets of paper where they have made the marks otherwise the lines would easily be mbbed out but take care as have observed before that this amend- ment be made suddenly for these tender draughts are soon vanished if one does not take care to strengthen them immediately begin first at the bottom of the drawing another way is to take thin piece of paper and hold it against glass-window principally at such window as is sashi ’ for the interruptions of the lead in the smaller glazed windows will hinder part of this prospect the point is draw what you see from the glass and then the black-lead paper is to be used as di- rected before there is another way still which may be more easy to the hand or arm of person not accustomed to draw- ing upon paper or lawn placed upright which is by- the use of portable camera ofcura though to help the first one may hold baguette or such stick in the left-hand as the oil painters use to rest the right-hand upon or have some other rest made for the right-hand as may be serewed up and down at one ’ pleasure but there is this difference still between drawing piece of perspective or view on transparent paper or lawn placed upright against any object that such piece will take in more of the view or object and from greater distance than the portable camera ofcura will how- ever as the portable camera will at first be most easy to the arm for the beginner by reason the objects ap- pear upon anhorizontal plane such as table the hand will have proper rest and more readily follow the lines represented on the plane with that exactness in- deed such portable camera as mention is of some expence and to such as can afford it they may have them at any price from thirty shillings to five pounds piece according as they bespeak them at the mae thematical instrument-maker ’ what will make the difference in the prices will be the largeness of the sizes of the glasses which lye ho¬ rizontally and receive the objects which we are to trace out with our pencil the smaller of these glasses may be perhaps four inches square and the larger fifteen- inches on such glasses you ill meet the exact re presentation smaller or larger according to the bigness of the machines of the objects we point or direct them to each one adorned with the natural colours agreeable to the point of distance stronger nearer the eye and gradually declining as the objects are more remote from it the shades of the several colours are in this way expressed in very lively manner few leffons with good consideration will be of good information not only to beginner but to master of the pencil but still to advance the knowledge and use of this portable camera suppose that instead of the glasses which receive the objects speak of there should be placed frames of transparent paper to receive the ob- jects we have mind to take upon which one may use the pencil still with greater freedom one may have dozen or two witli each camera or one frame will serve as for many papers as we please to strain upon it if one has patience to pafte them on there is another way of drawing objects in the ca- mera ofcura way which is by making room as dark as may be only leaving an hole in one of the window- shutters as low as possible to receive an ox-eye glass as they call it which is sold by the mathematical in- strument-makers this turns in socket so as to di- rect every object within certain reach to sheet of paper placed at proper distance within the room to receive those objects upon which paper yon may draw them in great perfection but they all appear revers ’ or the wrong end upwards however they are in as exact proportion and beauty as those represented in the former in this case ’ tis not however more difficult to draw or rather copy the objects though they are re- vers ’ than to draw or copy the several things which we see upright on the frames of transparent paper lawn or tiffany for to trace lines will be as eafily done done one way as the other and though the objeets falling on the sheet of paper will when we are draw- ing them be revers ’ ’ tis but turning the sheet of pa¬ per upside down when they are done and our drawing will be right to the eye when we shew this by way of curiosity to those who âre unacquainted with the reasons wliy the images re- presented on the sheet of paper appear upside down it would not have so desirable an effect as if they could be viewed in their natural situation but to obviate this difficulty let the sheet of paper which is to reccive the objects be placed against the back of chair and let them look on the several objects represented on the paper over the back of the chair which will set them upright to the eye this way in bringing them to rights is thought on by very few though at the first proof every one will wonder that he did not find it out sonner thas far is shewed how any oné may copy either print drawing or piece of painting or even make an exact representation from the life but must yet add concerning the taking off of prints or drawings method or two which are easy and diverting not be- foré mentioned one is prick with pifr any oût- lines of print or drawing one has mind to copy and then laying the said picture on sheet of paper take powder-puff or tuft of cotton dipping it now and then in charcoal-dust or red chalk-duit and beat it ver the prick lines through the picture renewing it with dust frequently by dipping and then yoû will have full directions marked on your cloth or paper sufficient to finish just drawing such prick piece of work will give many hundred proofs of its use though it spoil tlie print or picture it faves vast deal of trouble to the painter on the drawing part another way there is to make an impression from the print which shall give just copy of it this is of greât use when we want to carry every stroke of the engra- ver along with us it will indeed sully the print à little though very little if you are careful and this method will will perhaps cost you two minutes time when the drawing of it with every stroke the engraver has made would keep you busy month for this take some foft soap either white or of the green fort but for my part always used the green soap mix this with water near an equal quantity till tis near the consistence of jelly rub some of this mixture on the print and gently wet the paper you would have to receive the impression from it with wet spunge then lay it on the print and cover all with two or three other pieces of dry paper and rub it very hard all over with any thing that is smooth and po¬ lished and the wetted paper will have upon it the re- verse of the print you rubbed it upon with every di- stinct line in the original if you have been careful to rub it equally chap iii secrets sor copying of drawings con- tinued to take drawing witb fixt ink one way is to take thin sheet of paper and rub it all over with fresh butter as equally as pos- sible then dry it well by the fire and rub the butter ’ side with carmine till ’ tis all equally colour ’ or else rub it over with lamp black or black-lead powder or with blue bise finely ground take care in the rubbing on any of these that the colour will not come off by very slight touch of the finger and they are then fit for your work when you have chosen print or defign that you would copy lay the colour ’ side of your butter ’ pa- per upon piece of clean paper and your print upon the butter ’ paper and then with fine pen or needle blunted blunted very little at the point trace the out-lines of your drawing carefully and you wiil have good copy of it upon yoar white paper which may be touched up afterwards by crayons of the like colour red ink for making an impression of print one may likewise use the following method for taking off or making copy from any print which is to mix somc vermillion finely ground with linseed oyl but so liquid that it will run or flow in pen with this trace the lines of your print and as soon as all is done then with spunge and water wet the backside of the print and turn the printed side down on piece of white paper so as to lye smooth then lay over that piece of dry paper and press it hard in every part and the lower white paper will receive the impression but if you have linnen-press ’ tis better to put your papers between two of the wooden leaves and skrew the press as tight as may be for you will then have fine impreffion taking draughts witb red loose ink you may likewise take some vermillion finely ground and mix it with fair water in gallipot with some cotton and it will run very freely in the pen so that one may make the finest strokes we desire then with this mixture draw over all the strokes of your print imi- tating both the finer and stronger lines when all is done then with spunge dipt in gum-water with clean white paper and whileit is wet turn the print upon it and pressing it well take off the print and all the strokes will remain on the clean paper and as soon as tis dry the vermillion will be fixt to it this fort of ink is what famous writing-master used when he had book of writing engraving for him he writ with this and having his copper-plate covered with white bees-wax or white ground he turn ’ the written side down on the waxt side of the plate and rub- bing it very equally the impression will be upon the wax taking draughts witb blue loose ink you may likewise make such sort of ink of blu bice and common water which will run very finely in pen and serve for the same use as the above ink to take off drawing in standing red colour by traeing- take vermillion finely ground and mix it with lit- tle fresh butter then rub clean sheet of paper with it on one side till it will bear slight touch of the fin- ger without leaving the paper too freely then use this coloured paper by laying the colour ’ side upon clean paper and upon the colour paper lay on your print and trace every line you think proper as directed before in tracing but be sure you pin the three papers together at the corners to prevent their slipping for if any one should slip your work will be spoil ’ or some one or other may inadvertently take up the print when you place it right again so that your labour will be all lost this impression made by tracing will hold without rub- bing in tracing the quills taken from swallow ’ wing are very good after they are thoroughly dry if one has carmine enough by one he might mix it with little fresh butter and colour paper with it as before directed and then your drawing will be of more beautiful colour or if we would have the drawing blue we may colour paper with blue bice and butter speedy way of printing the leaf of any tree or herb as exact as nature it self take the leaf of any plant you desire and rub the veins on the back-side little with piece of lvory or dog ’ tooth to bruise them little then rub it gently with piece of woollen cloth dipt slightly in oyl of linseed when you have done this every where on your loaf put the oyl ’ side on piece of white paper and pressing it equally in every part the paper will remain pertect impression of it which may be afterwards co- loured ’ tis soon done and is useful to such as would remember plants aoather way of printing the leaves of plants so that tbe impression shall appear as black as if it bad been done in printing press take any leaf and when there is no wet upon it take such ball as they use at the printers for laying the ink upon the letters and when your ball is equally covered with printer ’ ink strike it gently four or five times on the back of the leaf till all the veins are black with the ink then lay your leaf on trench- er or small board with the black side upwards and then wet piece of white paper to be somewhat more than moist and lay it on your leaf and upon that lay smooth trencher pressing it very hard but not so much as to break the fine fibres of the leaf by this means you will have fine imprefsion but it would be still more easily done if you could get piece of wood made like cylinder about foot long and at inch and half diameter and cover the middle part of it abous six oreight inches long with woollen-cloth rolled three or four times about with this roller roll the wlite paper that lyes upon your leaf backwards and forwards four or five times and you will have very curious impression thenecessaries for this work are gallypot of print- ers ink couple of small balls such as the printers use to lay the ink equally on the leaf and the roller men tion but where printers ink can not be got then take the following method to take the impression os any leaf as certain as the form' way onsy using such things as may be had in any part op england when you have no printers ink rub tke back of leaf as before mentioned with linseed oyl burnt an then strewing some powder of black lead or for wan of that some charcoal or small coal dust or the pow der of burnt cork equally upon fmooth board just ta cover it stroke it over smoothly with the blade of knife knife and when the back of the leaf is oyl ’ clap it apon the board and then putting your white paper up- on the black side of the leaf either press it or roll it as before but if none of these ingredients should be found ver -- million may always be found at an apothecary ’ and mixing this with fresh butter to the consistence of printers ink cover your printing balls with it and dab them upon the back of the leaf and so take off your im- pression as aforesaid the reason why the back of the leaf is the proper side to make the impression from is because the ribs or vessels rise on that side above the fleshy part of it and therefore when they are colour ’ with any of these inks will give an impression but in the front or fore side of leaf the fleshy parts rise and these sine fibres are sunk below them memorandum where vermillion is used blue bice may be used either with butte or with oyl as follows fine red or blue printers ink for making impressions of this fort grind either vermillion or blue bice with some burnt linseed oyl and use it as you would do the other printing ink the blue should chuse for this work because if we should colour the leaf the blue would be an agreeable colour to the green forts the method of takingoff the leaves of plants in plaister of paris lo that they may afterwards be cast in any me¬ tal those persons who cast in metal have frequent oc- casion to use leaves of several sorts to embeilisn their works which are generally made from models done by the hand which take up great deal of time and at last are imperfect but the following way which ilearnt from gentleman in italy is much easier when you have gathered the leaf you desire to take an impression from lay it between the leaves of bool till it will lye flat then upon smooth board with strong gum water made of gum arabic six the fore-side or front of the leaf to the board when this is done raise about it à little wall of course paste half an inch high or if you can conveniently surround your piece of wood with paste-board or card paper so close that it will hold liquid for some time then oyl the back of your leaf as is recommended in the chapter for casting of medals and pour on water and plaister of paris as is there di- rected which when ’ tis dry will give you an exact im- pression of every vein of the leaf and from which you may easily make mould to cast in as your fancy di- rects you the manner of making the impressions of any buttersly in à minute in all their colaurs when yon have taken buttersly kili it without spoil- ing the wings and contrive to spread them in flying manner as regularly as may be then take piece of white paper and with small brusn or pencil wasn part of the paper with gumi water little thicker than ordinary so that it may dry at an easy rate then lay your butterfly on the paper and when ’ tis well fixt cut away the body close to the wings and throw that way then lay the paper on fmooth board with the fly upwards and on that another paper upon which put smooth trencher and great weight upon that or else put your whole preparation into ascrew-press and serew it down very hard letting it so remain for an hour then take off your buttersly ’ wings and their perfect imperfection with all their beautiful colours mark distictly will remain on the paper have done several this way which answers very well and to ex- plain the reason why it can be so you must understand that all the sine colours observed on butterfly ’ wings are properly feathers which stick to the gum so falt that when the gum is dry they leave the wing when you have done this draw between the wings of your impression the body of your butterfly and co- lour your drawing of that body after the life chap iv of taking-off medals instantly by various ways not known it may be useful to some people to learn another way of preserving to themselves good specimens and fine designs of medals that is such as may serve to draw from at any time and many thousands of these specimens may be taken in one day at tri- sling expence one method is to take lchthyocolla isinglass which is sold at the druggists and is call ’ likewise fish-glue it is made up in rolls twisted in the form of figure of eight this being broken to pieces take about an ounce and dissolve it in water enough to cover it over the fire stirring it gently till all is dissolved then with camel ’ hair brushi stroke some of this glue over the medals you want to take off when all the surface is coverd let them lie till the glue is harden ’ and then with the point of fine needle or pin raise the edge of the glue from each medal and the whole impression in glue will sly off as hard as horn with all the sine sharpness of the medal as if it was struck this glue may be made of any co- lour we please by mixing the colour we want in the water we melt the glue in five hundred of these impressions in glue will not weigh above half an ounce dry ’ immediately not in an hot sun nor in damp place but regularly if we use the isinglafs without any colour mix with the water we may when we take our copies from the medals breathe gently on the concave side of them which in some measure will moisten our medal and then lay it upon piece of the thickest sort of leaf- gold which will stick to it and by fhining through the isinglass will-appear like gold medal and if we would imitate copper medal we should mix carmine with the water we dissolve our isinglass in when prescribe water for this end it is because it will do well and may be had any where but bran- dy or spitits of wine will give glue much greater strength so as to be less subject to soften by damp air when mention this ’ tis from an experiment made for preserving the natural colour of flowers several vears which may be useful to the curious who use this glue on any occaasion and is as follows to preserve the leaves of tatips make some card paper into the figure of dripping-pans and with strong mixture of gum arabick and water six them to the card then pour on gently warm some of the isinglass prepared with brandy or spirits ’ till the leaf is quite cover ’ and in an hour or two the li- quor will become hard and by keeping the air from the flower will preserve it in all its colours for seve- ral ycars the same may be done with the blossoms of the auricula which will preserve all their colours as if they were painted shall now mention the manner of taking off me- dals of the largest sort which will still preserve to ua the delincations of many curious pieces and valuable designs for this use with tuft of sine cotton little greased with sallad oyl rub the medals gently over and melt some stone brimstone enough to cover the medal half an inch thick then put an hoop of stiff paper round the edge of the medal and when the brimstone is melted and not too hot pour it on thé medal and as soon as it is fixed and hardened if you untie the hoop the impression on the brimstone comes clean from the medal which will produce sharp and correct mould to cast another from in plaister of paris but this should not be used on silver me- dals because it will change their colour if the medals are silver use the same method of binding them round with paper and oyling them mix à little plaister of paris with water and fill the hoop with it then immediately sill the case in sprink- ling manner with the same plaister till if hardens and when it is dry take it from the medal but from the moulds cast in brimstone which are concave we again cast such medals in plaister of paris as are convex oyling the mould as before and using the plaister of paris as above directed so you may take off any medal or fine bass-relief with great deal of exactness even so as to form medals from them in any fort of metal but there is no one that know so curi- ous in the management of this affair as mr pingo in neu stree square near shoe lane london there is method of taking off impressions in plai- ster of paris from copper-plates by oyling in minûte degree the plates and then binding them about either with card-paper or other paste board and pouring on some of jthe finest plaister of paris and water you can get and finishiing the work with plaister till it be- comes dry and hardens you will then have fine im¬ pression if one may so call it of the lines of the plate in the plaister which will serve to draw from when you have occasion we may add still the manner of taking off any fine engravings from the tops of snuff boxes or watch- cases which is only holding them over the smoak of candle till they are quite black then wipe off the black with the soft part of the palm of the hand and lay on the engraving piece of white paper little wetted with spunge and over that thin piece of flannel or piece of broin paper held hard down over the engraved part and being hard rubb ’ the paper next the picture will receive fine impreffion as if it had been pass ’ through rolling-press we may yet recommend another method of taking off medals in great perfection which is by getting thin pieces of lead and placing the medal horizontally on the top of firm post or any steady place lay over the lead flat piece of harder metal and over that place piece of round turn ’ stick such as is used in the staff of broom sawn off above five or six inches in length and holding that tight with your left hand on the lead and flat piece of metal strike the top of the stick smart blow with large hammer and the lead will be perfectly impress ’ with the image of the medal medal this blow must be done at once to render the impression perfect even this may be done on any im- pression made on sealing wax we may likewise take off medal by laying over it piece of thin sheet block-tin otherwise called foyle which is sold at the same places where the plaister of paris is to be had or at some pewterers shops and rubbing it hard upon the medal it will give us very good likeness of whatever medal we rub it upon the block-tin sheet mean is such as is laid on the backs of glasses when they are to be silver ’ to render them looking-glass we may also take impressions from medals with putty such as the glaziers use although the medals or bass-reliefs are under-wrought another way of taking off medals is to provide the scraps or shavings of white paper which you may have at the book binders you must boil them well in common water till they are tender then bruise them well in mortar till they come like paste and boil them again in spring-water with little gum-ara- bick and letting this mixture settle while pour the water from it through sieve or linnen-cloth and what remains is extraordinary good to either press into any mould or upon any medal and when the paste is dry it will come off very sharp some medals that are under- wrought can not be taken off this way therefore in such cases we must take common glue with water melt it and when we have fixt hoop of paste-board round the edge of our me- dal pour on the glue hot having first oyl ’ the me- dal with lump of greasy cotton when the glue is dry and hard we must take off the hoop and the glue will sly from the edges of the medal and it will then easily come off being subject to bend and give way which the other things before mentioned will not do we should mind to make our glue strong enough and pour it on one third of an inch thick when we have taken the impression by this means we must hoop round our mould of glue with card-paper or or paste-board as before and oyl it so that no bub- bles or blisters may be seen that is to say just make it greasy then we may cast some plaister of paris in it and we shall have good copy of the medal when this is dry the glue will fly off or may be broken off and we shall have good pattern to cast from we may likewise make putty of linseed-oyl and sine ground starch which being well workt together into paste will take good impression from any me- dal this is much better than the common putty when we have these moulds we may cast in them good medals in bees-wax but they will come off much sharper if the mould be in brimstone than if it be in plaister of paris but when we do this our wax should be as well blanch ’ or whiten ’ as one would use for wax candles it is however necessarv to grease the mould before we pour in our wax as have di- rected before however thot recommend white wax as prefer- rable to the other would not chuse to have the copy of the medal white for the darker colours shew the figures much better if we would have our copy of red colour we must mix vermillion with our wax when ’ tis meting or if blue put into our melted wax some stone-blue well beaten or ground as soon as our wax medals are cold enough to take off we should lay some leaf gold upon them and with piece of cotton press it down gently without rub- bing it backwards or forwards and that will gild our medal when we have cast medals in plaister of paris to make them look like steel or metal we must rub them over with piece of cotton dipt slightly in oyl and then put on them some powder of black lead and rub them well with brushi such as is us ’ for the teeth ’ till the whole is equally cover ’ and they will have fine gloss upon them but we may make the plaister of paris medals of the colour of box by boiling them in linseed oyl and it will harden them so as to bear the brush to be clean ’ if any dust gets at them if we would have our plaister of paris medals of yellow or golden colour we must take little pearl affi and boil it in pint of water ’ till it makes strong lixivium then put in about half quarter of pint of french berries and boil them till the liquor is of very strong yellow and use this liquor with our plaister of paris instead of common water if we would have our plaister of paris medals be of blue colour we must boil some lacmus or litmus in river-water ’ till the water is as blue as we think pro- per and must use this water with our plaister when we cast medal to render it of fine colour if we would have our plaister medals of red co- lour we should boil little raspings of brasil wood in pale stale beer and when it is strain ’ off use it as common water with the plaister have not yet try ’ whather the sine transparent gum made of verdegrease will mix with plaister of paris but have good reason to judge that it will and as ia is cheap enough fuppose it woald not be unworthy any one ’ tryal have often thought that by these means one might easily collect set of all the coins of our nation and to distribute them as one should in the several kings reigns they would make no disagreeable furniture being plac ’ in proper order the gold by themselves of each king ’ reign with his figure and the reverse by one another and under it the value of the coin then the silver in their proper order and the brafs or copper or pewter for such we have had and even the leather coins should not escape our notice or to improve this if we had time to spare and good opportunity we might have the resemblance of the coins of every country and by writing the value of each of them such collection would be of use te travellers as well as to historians the eafiest way of doing this would be with the lchthyocolla or fisni-glue and so for the gold coins ase leaf gold as before directed for the silver leaf- silver and for the copper leaf copper which is made in germany or else for silver we should make our medals with foyle as before directed and for the lea ther coins mix à littie fullers earth with the water or spirit before we melt the fisn-glue or isinglass in it so far have given instructions how we may either make drawings from the life or coppy whatever we think proper from prints paintings medals tho we knew nothing of drawing before of colours for illuminating of prints in the best manner or of painting in water- colours colours are to be distinguished in the follow- ing manner we must first take white the next yellow the next orange and then proceed to the red after that the purple then to the blue and after that to the black observe white and black are the ex- tremes of colour then in the next place yellow is the lesser point of colour towards the white and the next to that is the green and after that the blue speak of this because every one who has mind to know the manner of colouring of prints or painting in miniature may profit by it shall begin then with regard to colouring of prints if the paper be pure white use no colour upon it unless in the shaded parts and then in painting of flowers if they tend towards reddishi colour use faint colour of carmine with gum water upon the shades only if blueisn use little faint indigo in gum-water slightly pass ’ over the shades easily touch- ing upon the lights where there is yellow tinge either use faint tincture of gamboge or of french berries which will be described among the yellows or if the white have purplish cast ule thin lake on the shady side suffering the- colour only to shine little into the light it will give lustre to the whites and if greenish cast should be there use either faint colour hardly to be disgern ’ of the sap green or in proportion of the sap green mix ’ with the ver- degrease green ail these colours mention ’ to shade the whites may be found in the following directions chap vi of whites for painting in miniature the best white that is pretended to be sold in the water-colour manner is the flake white which is better than the white- lead ground this if it is pure far exceeds the white lead in beauty for the white lead is apt to turn blackiss especially if you use it with hard water but the best white that know is madeof pearl or the finer parts of oyster-shells made into an impal¬ pable powder that is so soft as to feel like grounds of starch or powder for the hair when we touch it with the fingers this is called by some of the colour men pearl-white but ’ tis hard to be found if we have oc- casion to use it this white will mix well with any colour but if we use white-lead let it be first rectifi- ed with white wine vinegar which will cause fer- mentation and soon make the white settle then pour off the vinegar and wash it with common water that is put the powder into glass of water stir it about and presently pour off the water while it is white into some clean receiver and when the white parts are settled pour off the water from thence and they will be extremely fine mention this that every one may make their colours of the finest fort it may be perhaps littie trouble but who would not use such pains to be superior to any thing that has been done before in the same way when the white we speak of is settled add to it as much gum-water as is necessary to bind it or give it glaze but take notice that would not have any white used in colouring of prints but only with dry colours when we paint in miniature it is remarkable that white lead will change black if the water we use with it comes from lron or clay when say black mean that in month or two you will find the places where it lies the thickest tinged with black and when ’ tis mix with any other colours it will soon change or alter it for this reason have try ’ divers sorts of white among others the powder of egg-shells of the bright- est colour and well clean ’ and wash ’ is very good to be ground with gum water or else put about twentieth part of clear white sngar candied to grind with it in water reduce this as fine as possible that is to the state of what we call an impalpable powder and use it gentleman whom have given this receipt to tells me that it is still more to the pur- pose to pour it on some rectify ’ spirits of wine which he says will clear it from the dross but have not try ’ the experiment suppose that when the spirit of wine has done its work it must he pour ’ off and then the parts left behind must be mix ’ with gum- water again but that egg shell powder is of great ser- vice as white in water-colours know very well and that also itself and oyster-shell powder well recti- sy and mix with the white of an egg well beaten will make an extraordinary mixture with other co- lours and correct them from changing or altering their qualities while am speaking of white for illuminating of prints as have already observ ’ that the clear white of the paper is proper to be left uncolour ’ so if it happens that the paper is given to fink as it is call or to spread any water colour we lay upon it more than isn ecessary then the way to correct it is as follows we must fix the paper in such station as may only receive the colour we lay on to glaze just as far as we design ’ it then take some starch boil ’ and prepared in water of middle strength and with large paint- ing-brust stroke it over the back of the print and when it is well dry ’ in the air or sun put the print in book with weight upon it to rectify the crumplings which it may receive by wetting of it so will any print be made to receive water-colours as one would have them be distributed and none of them will then run farther than we intended there is an earth brought sometimes from cbina of very soft nature and very white which find is better in water-colours than any of the rest but 't is very scarce chap vii of yellows there are some objects which have the ap- pearance of gold shining through the colour of green red or blue such as some fort of flies and beetles and such as the cantharides which last sort every one may buy at the druggists this goldtrans- parency is very well imitated by laying on the draw- ing some leaf-gold on the shaded part little giving in to the light side of the print the wzy of laying on of leaf-gold is to wasn the part where the gold is to be with strong gum water and soon after that put the gold on as smooth and even as possible pressing it down ’ ose with cotton but take care that when you lay on the gum-water you do not exceed the limits xou would have the gold appear to shine in this case the gold is only to snine through the transparant co- lour which is to be laid upon it now it must be understood that the leaf-gold will not regularly receive water-colours so that to tender it subservient to ou purpose we must with little thin liquor of ox gall in painting brush of camel ’ hair stroke it over and then it will receive any co. lour we have mind to paint upon it and hold it so you may have gold greens gold reds and pur- ples blues or what you please the greens may be first the verdigrease green which shall describe here- after or the sap green or lake or carmine if they are good or for purples lake and fine indigo or carmine and indigo and for the blues indigo on the dark side and on the light side little stroke of ultra- marine blue just to shine into the light and it will have wonderful effect one may find upon rose-trees in june and july beetle of green gold-colour which will serve to govern this kind of painting as for gold of itself would not advise it to be used unless we polish it and then you may take the following method we see in many manuscripts fine gold letters which rise above the surface of the volume or paper these have raised the admiration of the curious and the manner of making them is but little known the com- position which raises them above the paper is made as am well inform ’ of vermillion and the white of an egg whisk ’ or beaten up to that consistence as is call ’ an oyl work ’ together like kind of paste and with stamp six ’ to the paper with gum-ara- bick on this figure of letter wasn with camel ’ hair pencil some strong gumwater taking care that the gum does not reach more than the qout-lines then lay on the leaf-gold close with some cotton and as soon as it is dry rub it with some dry cotton and then polish it with dog ’ tooth this will make it appear as if it was really cast in gold there is yet another way of working these things in gold and that is by using the gold which is pre- par ’ in shells but it must be pure gold and not such as is brought froin some places in germany which will change green in few days time before you use this gold cover the snady parts with vermillion and then after your gold is well rectified with spirits of wine lay it on with gum-water which will mix with it very well and when it is dry polish it with dog ’ tooth chuse when lay on this powder gold to leave the lights vacant of it and it makes much brighter appearance than if one was to cover the object all over but if one was to cover by accident the whole piece with gold there is no better way to set it off than by tracing over the shady parts with gall-stones or which is much preferable the yellow which shall give the composition of below made of frexch berries mean that which is the deepest in colour little minium brightens it very much but see how rectify the mi- nium amongst the rens and polish the gold before you use any minium to it since have mention ’ gold iam next to speak of the yellows as they fall gradually in their course of strength the arst is kind of straw colour and is made of flower of brimstone which in itself is fine enough to mix with gum-water and the manner of preparing gum-water since have not yet mention ’ it shall insert at the end of this treatise of colours common way of illuminating of prints is by giving the tincture of gamboge for yellow and this may be of two or three forts either fainter or stronger the last to be shade to the first and that to be shaded with the preparation of french berries which shall presently mention the great mr. boyle has left some papers behind him that were never publish ’ which my lord carleton gave me and shall insert occasionally in this trea- tise with regard to yellow colours he says that if the roots of barberries are cut and put in lixivium made strong with water and pearl ashies there will be fine yellow colour produced from it which have tried and succeeds very well another way mr. boyle proposes to make transpa- rent yellow which is to take the root of the mul- berry which affords very yellowisn juice to wash it well from the earth in common water and boil it in the lixivium speak of made with pearl ashes and water from this we may take out strong tincture much deepper than the former but the roots of the mulberries are much harder to be had than those of the barberries for mulberry-trees are very scarce and the barberries are in almost every hedge in essex about litilebury especially with zegard to the barberry-root think it would be worth while to plant them on purpose for the ad vantage that one might make from them by dying the fruit in my opinion being of little significati- on but the root and the wood think will nearly answer the same end in producing fine yellow yellow oker will make another good pale yel- low but for illuminating of prints it is colour rather of too- much body however being well ground with gum-water it is of use after it has been well wasn ’ another good yellow may be made from the plant call ’ celandine infusing it in water and pressing it gently and then boiling the liquor with little allum this yellow will be little inelining to green but the yellow which like the best and may be used in several capacities of lights and strength is that made of french berries prepared as follows take of french berries an ounce whole and boil them in pint of the lixivium made of pearl afhies and water till the liquor will give fine tinge of yellow to bit of paper dipp ’ in it then pour it off from the berries and when ’ tis cool put it in bott for use but if we only put french berries to infuse in common water they will produce good yellow but then it will not be durable then again add half pint of the same lixivium to the berries and half an ounce of fresh berries and boil them ’ till the liquor is as deep as gall-stone which will serve to fnade all the yellows you can use of any fort you may boil this even to produce brown lour and with little ox gall it will serve to shade any leaf-gold that has been laid on ’ aper as directed before and is much preferable to gall-stone in imitating any gold-colour it answers well upon tincture of gamboge or any of the former yelbws next to this is the tincture of saffron which with common water only affords bright reddish yellow such as one would have to cover the shadow ’ parts of print for an orange or beld gold-colour how¬ ever there is nothing more high when we use saffron than when we infuse it in rectified spirits of wine but then the colour flies unless we load it with gum-ara- bick as have try as for deep yellow with body dutch pink comes the nearest to the aforesaid strong yellow made of french berries in point of colour and of lighter yellow is the englisb pink which is still made of french berries and in body likewise can not help observing that one may extract yellow colour for illuminating of prints from the fresh roots of ginger if one can get nothing else speak this because sometimes one wants good yel- low and any one may find this any where if gamboge can ’ be had and it makes fine green with the tran- sparent verdegrease shall hereafter mention this last hint took from mr. beyle ’ papers it is again to be remarkd that the engliss and dutch yellow pinks are made with french berries ground to fine powder and boiled chap viii of orange colour the orange-colour which is useful to wasn fine prints with consists in laying on teint of gam- boge and over that some of the minium or red-lead by bel ’ is meant the boiling of pure gold in liquors which will take away the yellow of it and bring it to be of reddish or higher colour such as shall describe to be wassi ’ and render ’ fine and fit for use fgr as it is bought at the shops it ie not by any means hne enough to paint with and especi- ally will change or turn black after few weeks if it be not refin ’ but if it be well prepared will be very lasting and beautiful but we must take this by the way that in the refining of it two ounces will not pro- duce above grains of good colour to stand the test of the painters shall presently describe the methoo of preparing it this colour may be mix witk gam- hoge upon white dutch tile to render it of the teint we desire either soft or stronger or one may glaze the gamboge and strengthen it with tincture of saffron tg make it glare into strong orange chap ix of minium or the brightest red-lead and how to prépare it he minium or red lead is as heavy and strong colour as most we have but is the most delight- ful one when well prepared that is when ’ tis well wash ’ and clean ’ of its more weighty parts which oc- casion it to turn black my way of doing it as the gieat mr. boyle directs is to put or ounces of it in quart of rain-water then stir it and pour off the vaater immediately and let it settle to the bottom of very cup or glass you pour it in then pour off that water and in day ’ time you will have the colour dry and as fine as you can wisni put then alittle piece of gum arabick to each glass or cup and as much water as will moisten each of them use any of these asterwards with-the guin-water as shall be hereafter di- rected but if the gum you should happen to put in at first may be strong enough to glaze it then use only common water in word as your colour is less gemm ’ or overgumm ’ use less or more gum water kr of itself ’ tis dead colour when you use this colour touch it gently on the yel- low we have mentioned into the light side and if it wants shade there may be little vermillion put upon it but vermillion is too heavy to paint with when we illu- minate prints because it hides the shades of the engia- ver however sometimes they had better be hidden than preserved for my part generally shade this red lead or minium with carmine which gives it fine effect and renders it equal to the brightest red flower ever saw leaving still the lights uncoloured only dafhing ittle way into the lights with the minium vermilion must advise to be left out of the questi- on unless it is well wasni ’ as have directed the mini- um to be and then chiefly for dry painting one may be abandoned it should be quite left out of my table of colours but speak at that time to such persons as can use it moderately and with judgment for all hea- vy colours will drown the shades or strokes of the en¬ graver when the carmine has shiaded the minium or red- lead it may be shaded again with lake in the strongest part to bring it to deeper red it may be wonder to some that when speak of orange colours should mention some of these deep sorts tending to purples but mention them as shades and without which the orange or red could not appear with any brightness ch ap of reds sect of scarlet when we have passed the orange we next conie to the scarlet which may be represented on plane with minium little mix ’ with vermillion but if you have occasion to paint flower of searlet- colour on print let your lights as well as shades be covered thin with minium and the shaded parts glaz- ed with carmine which will produce an admirable scar- let such as we see in the flower of the scarlet marta- gon sect ii of crimson from the scarlet we next come to crimson which is represented with carmine but must inform the verson who is to useit that there are several forts of it some darker and some much coarser than others and therefore it should never be bought by candle-light un- less of such as one can well trust for between the very best and the worst sort there is about ten shillings diffe- rence in an ounce or indeed all the money an ounce will coit tor the bad will spoil all our work sec iii of lake fterthis crimson coméi next the lake which snades and heightens the carmine but it is to be observ ’ that in the laying of carmine upon print let your lights be touched only with very thin teint of it hardly to be discerned then just on that part of the light which enters upon the shade lay it on strong and cover the shade with it and after that on the stronger part of the shade lay some lake sect iv of transparent crimson ut we may make à liquid colour not much in¬ ferior to carmine itself with the raspings of bra- sil-wood sold at the dry-salters and particularly at the great colour-shop at holborn bridge which mention because have been some time without knowing where to find it for sew colour-shops know what it is and lovers of painting in this way are now and then impa¬ tient to have such things and unacquainted where to find them out to make this transparent colour we may take an ounce of the raspings of brasil-wood and boil it in twelve ounces of pale stale beer and little allum till the colour of the liquor is as ftrong as you please which you may discover by dipping into it slip of white apaper and when the colour is as you would have it and tis cold pass it through linnen-cloth and put the clear liquor into bottle for use this is one of the receipts had from manuscript of the great mr. borle and if we have mind to bring this colour to bo- dy take ox blood and dry it till we can reduce it to powder which being mix with it will give us co- lour which think will be little less in value than middling sort of carmine and as gentleman of learning and good understanding in these matters in- forms me the blood of an ox or cow so dry will make good body for any colour sect crimson from mr. boyle iak the fruit of the berry bearing spinach which is known to every gardener about zondox them and you will have beantiful red colour' uice from them boil this and put about afourth part of alum to it when you pour it into the vefsel where ’ tis to cool and then it makes as sine colour as any ¬ thers that are noted and it is of little expence for it will grow any where and in one bunch of the fruit there are seeds enough to sow two or three rods of ground the red beet-root back with little strong vine- gar produces an elegant red colour equal to tincture of carmine then pour it on alum and when ’ tis cool ’ tis fit for use where carmine should be used in wasn- ing of prints for it is à sine transparent red sect vi indian-red ext tothese colours indian- red though it is coour of body is helpful for back ground for flowers at distance being used thereby with gum- water water but shall have occafionto give an example of it by and by have lately seen an earth brought from the isle of wight of much siner colour than the indian-red which and some others have try ’ and find to mix extreamly well with gum-water tho as it is of vi- scous nature it requires less gum than most other co- lours and as it is naturally fit for use without grind- ing and is viscous so it will asfuredly mix as well witk oyl as with water this was discovered by edward liste esq to which gentleman we owe many more extraordinary things of value there is one thing very extraordinary in this earth simple as ’ tis that if we rub deal-board with it it ren- ders it exactly of the colour of mohogany wood and stains it so deep and with so much strength that it is very hard to get it out- without washiing and dry as this earth was when receiv ’ it can not get it out of some papers which by accident were mix ’ in my 'ocket with it so that am persuaded it will prove of extraordinary use when its virtues come to be khowe sect vii of transparent purple fter this we may make transparent pur- ple either more red or nearer the blue colour as we shall see occasion by ufing the same menstruum as was prescribed in the former viz of pale stale beer one pint in which boil one pint of rasped brafil-wood and half an ounce of log wood or campechy- wood till the liquor is heighten ’ to the colour you desire which you must try by dipping piece of paper into it if you then find it too red add quarter of an ounce of log wood to the brasil-wood and you will find it much nearer the purple than the former and so one may ha¬ mour any degree of purple as you put more or less log wood to the former composition and six the co- lour with little alum this will produce such clear purples as no mixture of solid reds and blues can pro- duce and the receipt has been for à long time kept secret madam madam mariana of amsterdam who has been so-fa- moas for her painting in minature and her excelent manner of illuminating prints told me that the best purple éould use might be composed between the car- mine and indigo which to strengthen on the red side one may add lake between the lighter and darker part which have in many cases found to be good and of significancy and so lake when it is used in the same way on the foregoing purple or the liquid crimson produces very fine effect one may vary the colour of the purple either redder by putting more carmine or bluer by using more indigo which being mixed on white dutch tite will shew itself ch ap xi of blue sect of tbe ultramarine hhe first and best bright blue we have is the ui tramarine blue which gives spirit to all paint- ings where blues are used but it is very dear if we have the best even worth or at least sold at six ’ ounds an ounce it is made from the lapis lazuli divested of its gold and ground and made into an impalpable powder this colour however as it is of very high price will make good its value in painting as the least ’ ouch of it is enough to illuminate flower in using it leave the white or light part of the flower uncoloured excepting that on the edge of the light next tlie shaded larts co- lour it with uitramarine and little into the shaded part of the print add faint tincture of indigo tne indigo covering little the verge on the shady side of the ultramarine so will your flower if it be bright blue appear extreamly beautiful this is colour of body and will last as long as one would desire and even preserve any colour you can mix with it to use it singly there is nothing more dazling aa appeared in the case of colouring lron-gates which ma¬ ny years ago was executed at the entrance of devon- shire-house in picadilly this colour was laid upon the iron work at the expence of many hundred pounds and remain ’ in great beauty ’ till they were taken down and the entrance of that palace altered which shews that this colour will not change though it suffers all kinds of weather for ’ tis computed that they had been exposed upwards of sixty years but the best colour of this fort is rarely to be met with sect ii of the prussian blue the prussian blue is the next to the ultramarine for beauty if it is used in oyl tho imagine it will not hold so well as the foregoing considering it has riot the body of ultramarine this colour however is attempted to be ground in water but there is such an oily quality in it that it does not mix kindly with water and at the best will change as it is now prepar- ed in the common way it has been attempted to make blue ink which indeed held the colour for month- or two but then turn ’ to muddy yellow so when you put your pencil with gum-water into chell of this blue you will find where the water spreads the blue will change yellowisn till the body of the blue is well stirr ’ up and when we have done our best with this co ’ our in water it will only serve to shade ultramarine with but in oyl it serves very well for the present to- sill the place of ultramarine sect iii blue bise the next colour to the foregoing for brightness is that which we call blue bise which thol it is colour of body will flow pretty well in the pencil espe¬ cially if it be well wasned as have directed the whites and the minium to be done sect iv of sanders blue after this colour the sanders blue is of very good use and may serve as shade for ultrama¬ rine or the blue bise where the shades are not required to be extremely deep and is of itself pleasant blue to be laid between the lights and shades of such flower as is of mazarine blue as ’ tis called sect of lacmus or litmus blue nother blue which is beautiful colour and will run in pen as free as ink is made of lacinus or as some call it litmus which may be met with at most druggists this colour however is never met with prepared for water colours and therefore shall set down the following method of preparing it ac- cording to mrs. mariana for it affords bright colour which has extraordinary effects take of lacmus one ounce and boil it in about pint of small beer wort till the-colour is as strong as you desire then pour off the liquor into gallipot and let it cool for use it will soon become jelly and by de- grees grow hard this colour however is to be pened again and made liquid by water so as to be usell as ink and as it is rendered thinner or thicker so will it be paler or darker by what find of this lacmus it is not only beautiful but an holding colour for have some designs coloured with-it inthe year which still preserve themselves in as much beauty as they had at first and have seen some in holland which were said to be done with it forty years before which year or two ago lookd still as fresh as one would desire the first day one used it this colour however if it be touch ’ with aqua fortis immediately changes to fine crimson little inferior to carmine and then sinks quite through the paper so as not to be got out so that when we use this colour as hue it is best to preserve it from aqua-fortis or such strong acids it is good shade for ultramarine or blue bise where the strongest shades should not be extremely deep and for colouring of prints it is very good as it is- trunspapent colour and goes -great way sect vi of indigo undigo is the next colour fhall speak of as it certainly makes the strongest shade for blues of any other and is soft and warm colour when it is well ground and wafhi ’ with gum- water by means of stone and muller as one happens to want the use of this put more gum water to it if you would have it of the lightest cast or less as you would have it darker but besoie you touch your print with it try its strength upon white dutch tile for it runs warmly in the pen¬ cil and may chance to be too strong for yeur design which you should always think of when flowing co- lour is to be laid over dark shade of print which shade will much aggravate its blackneis and even make it appear quite black sect vii fine blue from mr. boyle take the blue leaves of rhue and beat them little in stone mortar with wooden pestel then put them in water juice and all for fourteen days or more washing them every day till they are rotten and at last beat them and the water together till they are in pulp and let them dry in the sun this will produce as good blue as indigo and be much sof- ter but to keep it long while when you beat it the last time add little powder of gum-arabick you may put more or less of the gum as you design to make it more free or tenacious in the working tis fine elue for shading and has good body and runs warm in the pencil sect viii of mr. boyle ’ transparent blue equal to uitramarine in the next place have colour to describe wliich took from the great mr. boyl ’ manuscripts given me by my lord carleton and proves beautiful blue and what admire it for the more is because the chietof the ingredients it is composed of may be easily had du- ring four of the semmer months that is the cyanus or blue cornbottle-sl wer which abounds in almost eve- ry corn-field children may gather it without hurting any thing about the skirts or verges of the corn-fields this flower has two blues in it one of pale colour in the larger outward leaves and the other deeper blue which lies in the middle of the flower both these will do if they are separated from the buttons or cases they grow in but the deep blue of the middle produces much the best colour as one may try by rubbing it whileit is fresh so hard upon piece of good writting paper as to prefs out the juice and it will yield an ex- cellent colour which will not fade as the experience of two or three years has shewed me this part of the flower is therefore the principal and what is to be de- pended upon therefore the same day that people ga¬ ther the flowers or the next at the latest employ some children to pick that part clean from the rest and when you have good quantity press what juice you can from it and by adding to that little allum you will have lasting transparent blue of as bright staining colour as you would desire and in my opinion it is not infe- rior in beauty to ultramarine but for the other parts of the flower which are paler must observe that when had bushiel of them gathered and had not an opportunity of pressing them immediately they changed white so that can not commend them left the alum should not fix-them but as for the middle of the flower it is certainly as good blue as can be desired and is du- rable if any one should objece that 'twill be troublesome to make it let him consider only what pains there is in gathering and curing of saffron which sometimes is sold at thirty shillings the pound and seldom brings three pounds per pound but blue if it comes up to the colour of ultramarine is worth four or five pounds per ounze especially when it stains so well as this does therefore should think it worth while when any one has made this experiment as have done to have piece of ground on purpose for this use where no other thing but this corn-bottle or cyanus should be sown and as this flower is plentiful enough in the fields be- tween twittenham and tedington in middlesex so there may be seed enongh gathered of it in quarter of an hour to sow an hundred acres there is likewise bundance of it in the large corn fields in cambriagesbire but how valuable are many things that we daily tram- ple under foot if we knew their virtues we should use them provided we could bring them to proper market but let that be as it wili gather the flowers about the beginning of june or in july or august and some you may find in may these are for your immediate work to make the colour of and must be dispatched as saffron is done or it will lose its perfections and as happen to mention saffron which very well know the management of by drying it on kilns ldo not see why thee chives of flowers may not be cured in the same manner they would certainly produce much greater body of colour and tincture might be drawn from them with more ease than if we were to press them raw or fresh from the field the way then that would have them dry ’ like saffron is to provide in the first place such kiln as is used for curing saffron within which make à small charcoal-fire which communicates an heat to the top of the kiln which is covered with an hair cloth and upon that lay on four or five sheets of white paper mean such as we use for curing of saffron then lay on the paper parcel of the picked flowers till you have the thickness of two or three inches laying close and flat with knife and sprinkle it with some thin gum-wa- ter then cover the cake of flowers with two or three more sheets of paper and lay upon them board with little weight upon it for fewminutes then take off ther board and taking hold of all the papers with both hands turn your cake of flowers upon the kiln and when ’ tis rightly placed take off the upper papers and sprinkle the cake again with some thin gum water and with knife settle your cake of flowers and lay on again your papers and board with weight upon it for minute or-two and then turn your papers again and again till the flower cake becomes united and of the thickness of à cake of saffron in this work you will findethe flowers grow darker every time they are tarned till at length the cake will look of à deep blue tending to black from whence we easily draw such as speak off during this operation great care must be taken of the fire that it does not scorch the flowers let it be gentie and as constant as may be which will be sure way to bring your flower-cake to good colour would advise in this case that whoever attempts this they should see the management of saffron or read ac- counts that are published of the curing it if any one is desirous of seeing the curing of saffron with the manner of the kilns the best artists that way are about chesterford and little-burry in essex though think it can be of no great moment since there is pub¬ lished large account of its preparation in mr. brad- ley montbly treatise of husbandry and gardening and in the present case of the blue have made the necessary alterations and think given what is sufficient for such as are acquainted already with the curing of flowers by kiln-drying but come now to speak of the culture of this valua- ble flower for must now so call it since am well assured of its perfections every knob or head of seed mustbe open ’ before we sow it for each head contains great number of seeds the preparation of the ground for the recption of this seed need not be more troublesome or expensive than common ploughing requires which being done sow the- seed either at the end of august which will come up soon enough to stand the winter and blossom early the may following or else sow it at the end of march and it will begin ffowering the following june when the ground is fresh plow ’ at either of these seasons sow the seed and harrowit in with bushies and it will pre- sently come up in the choice of the seed ’ should observe that it be gathered only in such fields where we are sure there grow no corn botiles of any other colour but blue and then one may expect all the plants which rise from such seed to produce blue flowers but if they should be gathered in such places where there are varieties of them we must expect various sorts as white red or purple although we are sure we gather the seed from such as were truly of the blue sort for according to the doctrine of the generation of plants which has been explained to the world in great many instances if there is red flow- er of the same tribe with this growing near it the diffe- rence of colour will be so intermix between both that the seed of both will bring variety from the principal depending of the colours ofboth and thus conclude what have to say of blues as for the smalt ’ tis much too heavy acolour to be used for illuminating of prints sn sn gee ee ch ap xii of black he proper black for water-colours is what they call lvory black which if it be pure and well ground is of use in minature painting but very seldom and indeed ought not to be used in colouring of prints if they are good for ’ tis too heavy colour and hides the beautiful strokes of the engraver unless done with very great care lfit is necessary however to use black by way of darkening print rather chuse à strong tinc- ture of good indiaa ink than the lvory-black but to colour pieces in miniature use the lvory black prepared as follows let your burnt lvory be wellground in gum-water and then beat the white of an egg very welltill you find kind of oily liquor settles to the bottom this liquor mix with as much of the lvorysblack as you think necessary to make it run freely in the pencil and it will afford an extraordinary gloss and if the object is fhining such as the wings of some beetles mix with somen of it little white upon ducch glazed tile ti ’ you find it light nough to relieve the sade and then make anotlier light- er mixture of the same which being used on the brighter part of the subject will produce the effect you desire chap xiii of greens the progress of gréens from yellow to blue have already given an account of the progress of colour from white through the yellows to the orange the reds purples and blues to the blacks and shall now treat of the greens in their sevéral orders from the yellows to the blues greens are allowed by all to depend upon the yel- low and the blue and by the help of one and the other colour may be framed any green colour we please the gamboge is one of our first yellows which with the preparation of verdigrease shall insert mav be made to produce five or six sorts of green according as thegamboge abounds or is in lessquantity if it abounds one may make tolerable oak green with it and being still more mixd with the verdigrease green it will be grass green but the yellow that prefer before all others is that which is made of french berries described above which have observed is of different capacities as the liquor it is boyled in is more or less stained with it when it is very thin it makes good glaze all over the verdi- grease and as it comes nearer to duich pink or gall- stone commands almost any colour we want being greeably mix ’ with the transparent verdigrease and still is transparent so the yellow drawn from the roots of barberries and those drawn from the koots of the mulberry-tree will produce in great measure the like effect being mix with the transparent verdigrease as for the verdigrease itself it produces fine blueisft green flows easy in the pencil and may even serve a ink to write with the preparing of this colour is yet very little known and shall therefore inform my reader how to do it take of common verdigrease three ounees break it little and boil it gently in pint of white-wine vine- gar stirring it continually when you perceive it to boil add little tartar broken and keep your mixture stir- ring till you find the clear liquor of such colour as you would wishi that is of sine transparent green with blue cast which you may do by dipping in stick and touching piece of paper with it when you have colour to your mind pour it through linnen-cloth into an open vessel and set it to cool when it is quite cold keep it in close vessel for use puring out little at à time as you want it for when it is exposed to the air ie will soon dry but is reducible again by common water when we prepare this liquid colour do not use the ¬ distilled verc.-grease for it will not answer the end we propose this liquid should be touched upon part of the lights and shades of print and the shades afterwards colour- ed with sap-green in the making this green take care vou make it strong enough for it is not to be strengthned after- wards without the trouble of boiling afresn but may at any time be rendered as faint as we please by mixing common water with it sap green is colour like that of an oak leaf if it is used thin with common water for this as well as the former wants no gum but it will if we use it strong produce as dark green as any we can imagine we may try our colour first on white duicb 'ile and by thinning it with water render it of what strength we please and brighten it very much with adding to it little of the liquid verdigrease sap-green is made two ways viz first take the flowers of the blue flag lris or flower-de- luce and press them while there is any juice to be got from them boil this gently in glazed pip- kin till it grows thick adding little alum to it and it will make very useful and lasting green in the boyling of any juice of the co- lours heretofore mentioned use an earthen glazed pip- kin for if you boil them in vessels of metal they will sometimes change from the design we intend secondly another way there is of produeing sap- green for washing or illuminating of prints which is to take the juice of buckthorn-berries and the ’ that juice simply will yield only dark parple of very base hue yet by adding tartar to it it will turn to good sap green and may be brought to good consistence by boiling either of these colours will mix with the liquid verdigrease above mentioned as well as maks à delicate shade for it there is yet one green more which is admired by some and carries good body with it with degree of transparency as make it tho as it is commonly used it is full-bodied colour fit only for miniature painting for this end they mix dasch pink with indigo to what degree of colour they please but in the phoe of duxrh pink my high preparation of french berries with indi go think much to be preferred as this answers all the intent of dutch pink and carries transparency with it which the dutch pink has not and thus have gi- ven such an account of the passage of greens from the yellow to the darkest blue as think necessary for the instruction of those who delight in illuminating of prints and painting in water-colours chap xiv tbe use and nature ef dry colours blue bise is the most excellent blue next to uitramarine which is too good to wash withal and therefore leave it out here and put in blue bise which will very well serve instead of it and indeed you may leave out both and use smalt instead of them but that it will not work so well as bise no bise is too good to use upon all occaslons but only when you intend to bestow some cost and pains upon piece otherwise you may use no other blue in your work than blue ver- diter with which you may make pretty good shift without any other blue mean in any ordinary work indigo is dark blue and is used principally to shadow with upon your other blue indigo and yellow berries mlxed together make dark green to shadow ther greens with'in the darkest places blue verditer is very bright pleafant blue and the easiest to work with in water it is somewhat in- elining to green and being mixed with yellow berries it makes good green this blue is most used verdigrease is good green but subject to decay when it is dry upon the paper it will be of allighter co- lour than it is when vou lay it first on therefore t it from that fault put some sap-green amongst it to dissolve it in and it will make it keep its colour this colour is of poisonous nature and therefore yon must be careful how you use it that it come not near the mouth there is distilledverdigrease to be bought at the colour-shops that is far better green than the ther but it is somewhat dear and the other will serve instead of it verditer-green is light green seldom used in thing but in colouring landscapes those places that should shew far off and it is good for such purpose because it is somewhat inclining to blue but you may make fhift to do any thing well enough without it for à little blue verditer mixed with copper green and little white will make just such another colour sap green is dark dirty green and never used but to shadow other greens in the darkest places or elfe to lay upon some dark ground behind picture which requires to be coloured with dark green but you may make fhift well enough without this green for indigo and yellou berries make juft such another colour copper-green is an excellent transparent green of fhining nature if it be thickened in the sun or upon foft fire and it is most used of any green in washing of prints especially in colouring of the grass- ground or trees for it is most perfect grass-green vermilion is the perfectest scarlet colour you need not grind it nor wasn it it is fine enough of itself on- ly temper it with your finger in galiipot or oyster- shell with gum-water and it will be ready for use if you put à little yellow berries amongst it it will make it the brighter colour this is principally used for gar- ments lake is an excellent crimson-colour with it you may shadow vermilion or your yellow garments in the darkest places with it you may make sky colour being mixed only with white with it you make flesh- colour sometimes mix together with white and little red lead it is of an excellent colour itself to colour garments or the like indian lake is the best lake but too good to be used to wasn prints with unless you intend to bestow great curiosity upon your work but the best sort of ordinary lake will serve well enough for ordinary uses but that also will be somewhat cost- ly therefore instead thereof you may ulb red ink thickened upon the fire and it will serve very well for your purpose and better than lake unless it be very good note if you would make light sky colour of your red ink or if you would mix it among your flesh- colour you must not thicken it you should rather chuse to fhadow your vermillion with spanish brown than thick red ink which will serve well for that purpose and is much cheaper but it is not altogether so bright colour and clear red lead is the nearest to an orange colour and putting à little yellow berries into some of it will make petfect orange colour but if you mean to make flesh colour of it you must put no yellow but only when you would make an orange colour this colour is used for the colouring of buildings or high- ways in landscape being mix ’ with little white also it is the only bright colour to shadow yellow garments with to make them shew like changeable taffety it is good also to colour any light ground in picture taking only the thin water of it and so for several other uses as you shall see occasion for it ii yellow berries are most used in wafhing of all other colours their colour is bright and transparent fit for all uses and is sufficient without the use of any other yellow saffron is deep yellow if you let it stand pretty while it is good principally to shadow yellow berries with instead of red lead and it is somewhat brighter shadow but you may make shift well enough without this colour for red lead and yellow berries make just such another colour light masticoat is light yellow just like yellow berries and white and therefore you may make shift well enough without it only for saving you labour to mix your yellow berries with white when you haveoc- cafion fora light yellow which you may sometimes make use of to colour light ground in picture and then fhadow it with the water of burnt umber or read-lead that is the thinnest part of the colour ceruse is the best white if it be good and finely ground ready to you hand as you may have it at some colour shops or for want of it buy white-lead pick ’ to your hand either of these will serve well enough for either of them being mingled with ano- ther colour make it lighter and the more you put the lighter they will be as you shall find in the using of spanish brown is dirty brown colour yet of great use not to colour any garment with unless it be an old man ’ gown but to shadow vermillion or to lay upon any dark ground behind picture or to shadow yellow berries in the darkest places when you want lake or thick red ink it is the beft and brighteft colour when it is burnt in the fire till it be zed hot tho if you would colour any hare horse dog or the like you must not burn it but for other uses it is best when it is burnt for instance to coloar any wooden ’ ost bodies of trees or any thing else of wood or any dark ground in lt is not to be used about any garments unless you would colour many old men ’ gowns or caps standing together because they must not be all of one colour of black therefore for distinction and va- rieties sake you may use umber unburnt for some of them printers black is most used becanse it is easiest to be had and serves very well in washing nore you must never put any black amongst your colours to niake them dark for it will make them dirty neither should you shadow any colour with black unless it be spanisn brown when you would colour an old man ’ gown that requires to be done of sad colour for whatsoe- ver is shadowed with black will look dirty and not bright fair and beautiful ivory burnt or for want of that bone burnt is the blackest black and it is thus made take lvory or for want of it some white bone and put it into the fire till it be thoroughly burned then take it out and let it cool and so flit it in the middle and take out the blackest of it in the middle and grind it for use chap xv of portable case for colours with directions for making gum alum and other waters before however conclude this treatise of colours let me advise such persons who are cu- rious in making observations of the colours of flow- ers to have always in their pocket small case with colours in it about the bigness of snuff box made of lvory about half an inch thick in which should be scooped several concaves about half an inch diameter each and as deep as the lvory would bear without go- ing through these cavities may be placed as near one another as possible and filled with colours of several sorts and as for the liquid-colours they will dry by being exposed to the air so that one may have them altogether in few days dry enough to be carried in the pocket shall suppose the piece of lvory disposed in the following manner viz in the foregoing figure one may observe the disposi- tion of the several cavities for the colours in the num- bers and on one fide little case for pencils and another for indian iné gum-arabick porv- dered with white sugarcandy or for any thing else an artist may have occasion for in the painting way in such case you may have thirty two sorts of co- lour under very easy command besides other necessa- ries then as cover to this let there be piece of plain lvory to open with an hinge that may serve as pallet and all this will lie in very narrow compass nay even though one was to add another piece of lvory of half an inch thick to open below that of the colours to include à small pair of compasses port crayon and some other such useful materials for drawing houv to make gum-water there remains now only to mention the way how to prepare gum allum and other waters in the best manner to make gum- water take of the whitest gum-arabick one ounce of clear white sugar candied half an ounce dissolve these in quart of clear water and add to it if you will little coloquintida when your gum-water is thus prepared pass it easily through fine sieve or piece of mussin and keepit in bottle so stopped that no dirt may get in and as you want to use it pour out à little at time for if this proves dirty or foul it will spoil the brightnefs of your colours the use of the coloquintida is only to keep the flies from spoiling your work if it should be exposed to make allum-water boil four ounces of allum in quart of rain or ri- ver-water till the allum is dissolved and let it stand twenty four hours uje of allum-water with this water wasn the prints you design to colour which will six thepaper so that the colours will not sink or run in it when you lay them on and will hep like- wise to brighten your colours if your paper is very thin and loose then let your pa- per be washed with the above water four or five times always dry before you lay any of your colours upon it but you must observe that if you design to varnisn your prints after they are colour ’ then wash the prints all over equally with white starch befgre you colour them and when that is dry lay on your colours to make lime-water lime-water is made by taking some anslackt lime and covering it an inch with water and so letting it re- main for twelve hours pour off the gdar and keep it for use with this water you may change your sap- green into blue water made witb pearl-ashes take about half an ounce pearl-ashies and steep them twelve hours in rain or river-water then pour off the clear and that water is excellent to use with brasil wood in order to enliven its red colour size for for water-colours take the cuttings of white glover ’ leather boil them in common water till the liquor will jelly yon may prepare any colour with this size when it is warm and it should always be used warm the use of it is that none of your colours should shine by candle light as they would do if they were to be mixt with gum water therefore the scenes of play- houses are painted in size the school of miniature part iii erected for the instruction of the ignorant the improvement of proficients and the general in- formation of such as are pleased with pictures in small herein are contained the most expeditious and in- fallible ways of drawing without being taught and all the methods of colouring stippling illus- trated by numbers of practical processes upon each head or article particularly useful to those whe would copy in colours from print to the whole are annexed many valuable receipts for preparing the colours which are peculiar to this kind of painting communicated by the best italian and other masters as also the preparation of an excellent polished gold and sbell gold published from an old mss london printed and dublin re printed by jackson at the globe in meath street bookseller connoisseurs and artists in painting and particu- larly to the fair ladies whoun- derstand and practice in minia- ture this most valuable piece is offered as à present every way wortby of their acceptance and attention most gbedient servant the editor london of the metbods of drawing colours grounds it is not my design to make any encomium on painting many mgenious men have done that work to my hands but tho ’ miniature has been ineluded in what they have said shall neverthelefs specify the characteristicks of this kind of painting in particular it is in its nature more delicate than any of the other sorts it requires to be beheld near at hand it can not well be executed but in small it is perform ’ on vellum or lvory colours are moisten ’ with gumwater only to succeed well in your attempts this way you should know how to draw very well but as most who concern themselves in this art are but seldom skill' in drawing and yet would have the pleasure of paint- ing without the fatigae of kearning to draw in which no progress is made to speak of but with time and much practice some contrivances have been started to supply the defect in this point by which person is enabled to draw without knowing how to do it with- out them sect ii the first is call ’ calting to do this you must blacken the back-side of the print or drawing yon would copy and having lightly brushi ’ off the dusty particles which might adhere to and offend the clean vel- lum you design to use lay your original on your vel- lum and fasten it thereto with pins but if instead of the back-side of the print or drawing itself you blacken only one side of fair piece of paper put this paper be- tween the print or drawing and your clean vellum with the black side to the vellum then with blunted pin or needle trace out the principle strokes of the print or drawing the out lines and the folds of the drape- ries and whatever else requires to be distinguish ’ bear- ing upon the pin or needle hard enough to leave the traces thereof on the vellum benéath sect iii reduction is another way proper for those who are not vers ’ in drawing and who would notwithstand- ing copy picture or other piece that can not be calked it is done thus you divide the whole piece into many small and equal squares which you are to make with small coal if the piece be light and with chalk if the piece be dark that in either case your squares may be the more conspicuous then you must make the same number of squares and of the same bigness upon pa- per to draw upon for if you undertook to doit at once upon vellum as you might fail in the first at- tempt you would run the hazard of spoiling your vel- lum by false strokes but the whole being duly adjusted upon paper we calk it upon vellum as is said above the original and the paper being thus mark ’ out we observe what is contain ’ within each square of the piece we would copy as head an arm hand and so on and where each is plac ’ all which you must punc tually follow on your paper and having thus obtain ’ the situation of each part we join the whole together after this manner we can enlarge as well as diminisn any piece we please by only making the squares on the pa¬ per larger than those on the original or smaller ob- serving always that they be the same in number sect iv to copy picture or any thing else of the same size we ufe orled paper dried or goldbeater ’ skin either of these we lay upon the piece and thro ’ them we see the strokes which we trace out with crayon or pencil.. we then take it off and making it fast to paper or vellum and holding it up to the light trace out what has been copied upon the oiled paper or skin cither with crayon or silver pin by the help of window or glass held up to the light we copy all sorts of prints designs and other pieces upon paper or vellum by fixing them to the pa¬ per or vellum we would draw upon this is an easy and very good contrivance for copying of the same size lf we would make the piece look contrary way we turn the printed or drawn side of the original towards the glass and faften the paper or vellum to the back-side of it we have also good way to take an exact copy of picture which is in oyl colours we with pencil and some lake mix ’ up with oyl trace out all the principal strokes of the pictures and thereto applying paper of the same size we pass hand over it and the strokes of the lake take the paper and aprear thereon which you may calk as before be mindful to clean the picture with the crumbs of bread before the lake dries we also to the same end use coal dust contain ’ in piece of sine linnen wherewith we pounce the piece we would copy having first prick the principal strokes of it and fasten ’ da piece of vellum or paper to the wrong side of it sect but there is way more sure and easy than any of the foregoing for one who has no hand at drawing by the help of mathematical instrument or compass as it is sometimes called which is commonly compos ’ of ten pieces of wood like rulers about the sixth of an inch thick and half an inch broad and for their length it may be foot more or less according to the size ofthe piece you would copy but that you may not mistake here follows representation of it the board must be deal coverd with cloth of some fort or other for the more convenient fastening of the piece you would draw and what you would draw upon then plant the compass with large pin run thro ’ the foot if-you would draw in small you must place the original at the first foot and the vel- lum or paper you would draw upon near to the foot removing it to greater or less distance according as you would have your piece greater or smaller to draw in great from small you need only shift your copy to the place of your original putting the former at and the latter at and in each case you must put à crayon or silver pin into the foot over your vellum and pin somewhat blunted in the foot over your original with which you are to follow all the lines while you bear with your other hand gently upon the pin or crayon on your vellum if one or the other be well sitted in the foot you need not bear thereon at all you may draw also of equal size but to do that you must plant your compafs in different manner it must be fix ’ with pin or axis run thro ’ the center and the original and the copy must be at an equal distance from the center in word you may draw several copies at à time and each of different size or equal to each other just as you shall please sect vi these are all the helps needful to be known by those who are unsxill ’ in drawing when your piece is sketched out upon the vellum you must with pencil of thin carmine run over all the strokes that they may not be defac ’ in working this done clean your vel- lum with crumb of gread sect vii your vellum must be glued to copper plate or to piece of thin board exactly of the same size with your intended piece to stretch it upon but your vellum must be finger ’ breadth larger every way than what you glue it to for your way is to lap it round behind and there glue it not offering to lay any glue under your paint not only for fear of some deformity but also be- cause of the impossibility of taking it off again but first of all you must moisten the fair side of your vellum with piece of sine wet linnen and put piece of white pa- per to the back side of it and so apply it to the plate or piece of board and stretching it thereon equally in all directions glue it as we just now directed viii sect the colours ui ’ in minature painting are black lead carmine brown red uitramarine gal stone lake of all forts brown oaker vermilkon spanisn brown french pink umber orpiment gumboge bladder green verditer naples yellow masticoat pale sea green german affies masticoat- yellow indigo plake white lvory black and white lead lamp black sect ix as all terrene colours and other grofs substances are too coarse for fine works how well soever they may be grannd because of kind of sand which still remains you may seperate the finest particles by tempering your colour in cup of water having stirred it weli with vour finger and the whole being thoroughly soaked let it subside for little while and then pour it off by inclination into another vessel and what you pour off will be the finest particles which you must af- terwards set to dry the colour thus prepared must when vou want it be temper ’ with gum-water as shall be said hereafter this is good contrivance and perfectly calculated ’ for the delicacy of small works sect if you mix à little of the gall of ox carp or eel but chiefly of this last with all your greens blacks greys and yellows you will give them lustre and vivacity not natural to them you must take the gall of eels when they are sxind and hang them by nail to dry and when you want any you must steep it in brandy and mingle some of it with the colour already tempered it will cause the colour to take to the vellum more strongly which it will not easily do when the vel¬ lum is greasy again the gall prevents it from peeling sect xi there are colours which purify by fire such as the yellow oaker brown red ultramarine and umber all others blacken thereby but if you burn the above- nam ’ colours with strong fire they change sor the brown red turns yellow the yellowoaker turns red the umber reddens also and white lead becomes of le- mon colour and is call masticot observe that the yellow oaker burnt cecomes softer and kinder by far than before and more so than the pure brown red and reciprocally the brown red being burnt becomes more soft and agreeable than the pure yellow oaker they are both very good the finest and most sincete uitramarine burnt in red-hot shovel becomes much more brilliant than before but refind aster this man- ner iii aer it diminishet and becomes coarser and harder to work with in minature sect xii all these colours are temper ’ in small lvory cups made on purpose or in sea shells with water in which have been previoussy dissolv ’ gum arabic and sugarcandy for example in good glass of water put the quantity of your thumb of gum-arabic and half that quantity of sugarcandy this last prevents the colours from scaling when applied which they com¬ monly do without it or when the vellum is greasy this gum water you must keep in neat bottle al- ways stopp ’ up and never dip colour ’ pencil into it but take it out with quill or some such thing some of this water you must pour into shell toge- ther with the colour you want and temper them with your finger till the whole be very fine ifyou find your colour too hard leave it to soften in the shell before you temper it then set it to dry and so do by all ex- cept the lris green and bladder green and gamboge which must be tempered with water only but ultra- marine lake and spanisi brown must be more gumm ’ than other colours lf you use sea shells you must first soak them for two or three days in water then scower them well in hot water to clear them of certain salt which spoils the colours if not washi ’ away ae xiii to know if your colours are sufficiently gumm ’ you need only make stroke with your temper ’ colours upon your hand which will immediately dry lf they break and scale they are too much gumm ’ and if they rub out by passing your finger across them they have not enough again if you lay your colours upon vellum and upon trial find that the colours come off upon your finger like dust it is sign they are not nough gumm ’ and therefore you must put more gum into the water you use take heed tho that you put not in too much for that will have hard and dry ef- fect your colours will be glutinous and shining thus the more they are gumn ’ the darker they are and if you would give greater body to colour than it natu¬ rally has you need only gum it well sect xiv you must have smooth lvory pallet of the size of your hand upon which you must distribute the colours for your carnations or flesh after this manner in the middle you must put quantity of white well spread out because it is the colour most resorted to and from the left to the right of it along the side you must place the following colours blue made of ultra- masticoat orpiment marine indigo and oaker white it must be ve- green made of ultrama- ry pale rine vermillion french-pink and white carmine and black equal parts of each on the other side of your pallet you must also spread out some white as before and when you are to paint draperies or any thing else you must near it pat the colour you intend to make them of therewith to work as shall instruct you hereafter sect xv it is of great importance that you should have good pen- cils when you chuse them wet them little and twirl them upon your finger if they keep their point they are good but if they break into many points of different lengths they are good for nothing particularly for srippling but above all for carnations when they are too sharp pointed with only foar or five hairs stick- ing out beyond the rest you must blunt them carefully with pair scissars it will be proper to have them of two « this is the term in minature for making of small points or dots two or three sizes the largest may serve for your grounds the middling for drawing and colouring and and the least for finishing to keep your pencil to good point you must often put it between your lips and press it and moisten it with your tongue tho yon have just taken up colour with it for if you have taken up too much you by this means diminish it and correct your error you need fear no harm from doing of this all the miniature colours if you except orpiment which is poyson have nothing displeasing to the tafte or noxious in them¬ selves when prepar ’ for use you must be careful to repeat this very often when you are stippling or fi- nishing particularly carnations that your strokes may be neat and clear as for draperies and other things whether in the drawing colouring or finishing of them you need not be so nice in this case it will be enough if you make your point upon the edge or rim of your shell or upon the paper you rest on when you are at work sect xvi to work as you ought you must be in room that has but one window which you must place yourself ve- ry near to with table and desk almost as high as the window and so six yourself that the light may al- ways strike in on the left hand of you sect xvii when you would lay on colour equally strong eve- ry where as ground for example you must make your mixtures in shells and take care that you have ¬ nough for your purpose for if they fall short you will be put to it to prepare them of exactly the same degrees of light or shade sect xviii having spoke of vellum pencils and colours let us now say how they are to be us ’ first of all if you would paint flesn or drapery or ought else you must begin by sketching or drawing with large bold but clear strokes like those who paint in oil your lights muft at firft be somewhat brighter and your shades not quite fo dark as is required for finishing because in stippling thereon you strengthen the colour which if too dark at first would in the finishing become too deep sect xix there are several ways of stippling or shading as it may be also call ’ every painter has his manner some do it with round points others make them longisn thers again hatch with fine strokes crossing each other in all directions till the whole appears as if stippled or wrought with points this last method is the best bold est and soonest perfected wherefore advise all minia- ture painters to practise it and to accustom themselves be- times to be rich mellow and soft in weir work that is that the points may be lost in the ground they are wrought upon and appear but just enough to evince that the piece is stippled hard and dry is the reverse of this manner of working beware thereof it proceeds from stippling with colour too dark for the ground and too dry pencil which gives the work rude cast or favour sect xx endeavour also to drown your colours into each other that no line of separation may be seen between them and soften your strokes with the colours on each hand of them so as to be equally blended with and confounded into each sect xxi when your pieces are finish ’ heightening them lit- tle has fine effect that is strengthening the lights with touches of paler colour than at first which must be softned away into the rest sect xxii when the colours are dry upon your pallet or in your shells temper them with pure water and when you perceive they have lost their gum whick you will know by their easily rubbing out either on your hand or vellum as have said before temper them with gum-water till they are in geod order sect xxiii there are several sorts of grounds for pictures and portraits some are quite brown with spanis brown umber with little black and white others are more yellow being mixed with good deal of oaker and others are upon the grey with indigo for this work make wasn of the colour or mixture you propose or according to the picture or portrait yon are about to copy and with this thin washi soak or prime your vellum this done lay it on thicker and spread it out boldly but uniformly as fast as you can never touching twice upon one place till it be dry because the second touch carries off what the first laid on particular- ly if you bear little hard upon the pencil sect xxiv there are still other dark grounds and these are of greenisn colour they are most in use and best adapt- ed for all sorts of figures and portraits because they set off the carnations to great advantage and are very ea- sily laid there being no occasion to stipple them as must often be done to the others which are seldom uni¬ form at first whereas these hardly ever miss you must prepare them with black french pink and white mingled together in different proportions according as you would have your ground lighter or darker lay it on thin at first then thick as before directed you may mix up grounds of other colours but these are the most common sect xxv if you are about to paint saint upon one of these grounds and would make small glory round the head of your figure you must lay on your ground ve- ry thin in that part or even leave it naked especially just where the glory ought to be brightest at first lay on pretty thick mixtre of white and little oaker and as you move off from the head let your oaker pre- vail more and more and that it may die away into the ground hatch it boldly with pencil and as you pur- sue the round of the glory take sometimes the coloor of the glory and sometimes that of theground mixing some white or oaker when it is rather too dark and this con- tinue till they are utterly confounded or scumbled into each other and that no separation between them be distin- guishable sect xxvi to make ground all of glory you first lay on bright mixture of little oaker and white adding more and more of the first as you draw more and more towards the extremities of the intended picture and when the oaker happens not to be dark enough for you you must go on darkening and darkening add gall stone then carmine and at last spaniss brown this ground you must lay in such manner that the different degrees of darkness may as much as possible insensibly increase and strengthen then you must stipple the whole with the same colours to blend it nicely together which is te- dious and difficult enough particularly when there are clouds of glory in your ground you must strengthen their lights as you remove from thefigure and finisn still with stippling swelling out the said clouds whose lights and shades must be imperceptibly lost into each other sect xxvii for day-sky you must mingle some uitramarine with great deal of white and lay it on as smooth and uniform as poffible with large pencil and broad strokes as for grounds layingit on paler and paler as you de- scend towards the horizon which you must make of vermillion and mine de plomb and of white of the same strength as finishes the sky and even little weak- er artfully blending the blue and the red which must come down to the front mingling atlast gall-stone and good deal of white so that the mixture may be paler than the first and all this must be so laid on that no separation be seen of the colours of this sky sect xxviii when there are to be clonds in your sky you-need lay on no blue where they are to be but fketch them ont if they are reddish with vermillion gall-stone and white together with little indigo and if they hap- pen to be darker you must use great deal of this last making the lights of one and the other with masticoat vermillion and white the proportions of each more or less according to the degree of strength you would give them or according to the original before you swelling out the whole with stippling for it is hard matter to lay them on uniformly in the drawing and if the sky de not sufficiently uniform you must stipple that like- wise you may cover also the places of your clouds in laying on the ground of the sky heightening the lights with good deal of white and deepening the shades this is the most expeditious way sect xxix night or stormy sky is made with indigo black and white mix ’ together which is laid on like the day sky to these add vermillion oaker and brown red for the clouds whose lights must be of masticoat or mine de plomb and -little white sometimes red- der and sometimes yellower as necessity shall require and when it is stormy sky and that in some parts you see lights whether bluc or red you may order them as in day sky scumbling the whole together in draw- ing and finishing chap ii draperies sect to make blue drapery put ultramarine near the white on your pallet and mix them such proportions as to produce very pale colour and ofa good body with this you may express your brighteft lights lights and afterwards add more ultramarine for such as are darker and so continue to do to the deepest fold and darkest shades which must be pure ultramarine and all this must be done with broad strokes of the pen- cil with adue regard had to the scumbling of the dif- ferent degrees of light and shade lofing the lights in- to the shades with colour not so pale as the lights or deep as the shades then stipple the whole with the same colours and the same degrees but somewhat strongly that the points may be seen the whole must flow imperceptibly together that the folds may not ap- pear cut and no line of separation be seen when the uitramarine happens not to be dark enough for the deepest shades how much soever it may be gummed you may mix indigo with it to give them the last degree of depth and if the lights are not strong enough they may be heighten ’ with white and very little uitramarine sect ii carmine drapery is done after the same manner with the blue except that in the darkest places you lay on vermillion before you use the carmine which is apply ’ without any white and in the deepest snades it must be well gumm ’ to deepen it the more add little bistre sect iii there is also another drapery all of vermillion with mixture of white for the lights laying it on single upon the darkest parts and adding carmine for the deepest shades you finish then with the same colours as in other draperies and if the carmine and vermilli- on together are not strong enough take carmine alone but only for the deepest shades sect iv drapery of lake is done like that of carmine mixing good deal of white therewith for the lights and but very little for the shades you are to finish with stippling but we use no vermillion sect purple draperies are made by the same rule having first prepar ’ mixture of carmine and uitramarine and continually using white for the lights if you would have it columbine or light purple your car- mine must be in greater quantity than your ultramarine but if you would have it more blue and deep let there he more ultramarine than carmine sect vi for flesn- colour drapery begin with laying on pale mixture of white vermillion and lake and shade with the same colours diminishing thequantity of the white this drapery must be very pale and de- licate because it must represent à slight stuff and cyca the shades must not be dark sect vii for yellow drapery lay on all over first masticoat and then over that gamboge excepting only the light- est parts where you must leave the masticoat pure then you must shade with oaker mingled with little gamboge and masticoat increasing and decreafing the quantity of this last according to the strength of your shades and when you want to be still darker add gall- stone moreover you may work with gall-stone alone for the deeper snades adding thereto bistre if it be not dark enough you finisn with the colours you began with stippling and blending the lights with the snades sect viii if you use naples yellow or french pink instead of masticoat and gamboge you will have another sort of yellow sect ix green drapery is produc ’ by colouring all over with verditer verditer with which if it prove too blue for you you may mix masticoat for the lights and gamboge for the shades then add proportion of sad green to shade with and as your shades grow very deep you must add the darker greens and even use them unmix ’ where you want to be extreamly dark you finish with the same colours à little darker than at first sect for black drapery you must lay on black and white and finisn with the same encreafing the black ap you want it for the shades for the deepest of which add some indigo especially if you would give your drapery the look of velvet you may in all cases touch up your lights with brighter colour sect xi for drapery of white woollen cloth lay on mix- rure of white à very little oaker orpiment or gall- stone to give it yellowifhi cast then shade and finish with blue little black white and bistre mix ’ toge¬ ther adding this last for your brownest shades sect xii light grey is laid on with black and white and finisn ’ with the fame made little darker sect xiii for minim dark brown tawney or dun dra- pery lay on bistre with white little brown red and shade with the fame mixtute but let it be little darker sect xiv there are other forts of draperies call ’ changeable because the lights are of one colour and the shades of another these are us ’ for the cloathing of angels and for other young and gay figures as also for scarves and other light parts of dress which fall into num- ber of folds and flow to the wind these are most commonly commonly purple and of these there are two forts the one with blue lights and the other with yellow sect xv for the former lay on uitramarine and white very pale for the lights and shade with carmine ultra- marine and white the same as for purple drapery so that only the very brightest lights appear blue and even then you must stipple with purple with large quantity of white and scumble the whole artfully to- gether sect xvi for the latter use masticoat for your lights instead of blue then proceed as for drapery of pure purple except that you must stipple and blend the lights with the shades that is the yellow with the purpie by the help of little gamboge sect xvii is order ’ like this last that is the carmine red lights must be masticoat and the shades carmine and you must use gamboge to scumble them sect xviii lake red like carmine sect xix green must be order ’ in the same manner as lake continually mixing verditer with the sadder greens tor the middling shades sect xx many other sorts of these may be contriv ’ at plea- fure keeping to the union of the colours not only in one figure but also in group of several figures avoiding as much as the subject will permit to put blue next to flame colour or contrasting green with black and sp of others that disagree or afford no proper union sect xxi other draperies may be made of sad dirty and brown mixtures and simples and all by the directions we have already given and otkers also may be con- triv ’ both of broken and complicated colours but harmony between them must be preserv ’ that they do not offend the eye there is no laying down rule to guide you in this you must by experience and practice make yourself acquainted with the power and effect of your colours and work accordingly sect xxii linnens are painted thus having drawn your foldt as when you dodrapery lay onwhite all over and then proceed and finisn with mixture of ultramarine black and white taking more or less of this last according to the degrees you want of light and shade and for the deepest folds take bistre and little white using it sparingly and with artful touches and you may even take the sormer pure for the deepest shades where yoa must express the folds and lose them into the rest sect xxiii they may be made after different manner by lay- ing on all over very pale mixture of ultramarine black and white and then proceeding in the manner ¬ bove directed with the same mixture but à little deeper and when the shades are stippled and finisn ’ you must heighthen the lights with pure white blending them with the first colour or ground but of what fort soever you make them you must when they are fi- nish ’ prepare some yellowish tints for certain places laying them on lightly as it were washi so as to be transparent and neither to hide the stippling nor the shades sect xxiv yellow linnens are made of white mix with little oaker then proceed and finisn with bistre mixed with with white and oaker and for the deepest shades with bistre alone before you finish lay on tints of oaker and white here and there and others of white and ul- tramarine as well upon the shades as the lights but very thin and then stipple and scumble the whole toge- ther and it will have fine effect as you finisn touch up the extremities of the lighes with masticoat and white these linnens and the former vou may stripe like agyptian scarves with blue red ultrama- rine and carmine red one between two blue ones very bright on the lights and stronger in the shades the heads of virgins are generally dress ’ with veils of these sorts and of the same are made sort of handkerchiefs for an open breast because they are very becoming to the flesn sect xxv when vou would have either the one or the other of them to be transparent and shew whatever whether stuff or flesh is underneath lay them on at first very thin and mingle with your shading colour little of that which is under them particularly at the extremities of the shades and touch only the extremities of the lights only for the yellows with mafticoat and white and for the whites with white alone they are also to be make another way especially when you would haye them quite transparent as muslin lawn or gause to this purpose you must begin and finish what is beneath as if nothing was to be over it then heighten the brightest folds with white or masti- coat and shade with bistre and white or black or blue and white according to the colour you aim at and taking away from the liveliness of the rest by soiling it over tho ’ that be not altogether necessary but for the darker parts sect xxvi for crape you must do as above only observe that you draw the folds and the borders or edges with little threads alone upon what is beneath which must first be finish ’ sect xxvii when you would water stuff of any fort you must wave it with lighter or darker colours according as what you are upon is light or shade sect xxviii there is such way of touching your draperies so as to distinguisn the silken from the woollen these are more coarse and stiff the others are finer and more free or glossy but it must be remember ’ that these are effects which depend partly upon the stuff itself and partly upon the colour of it and in order that you may apply them in such manner as shall be agreeable to the sub¬ ject and to the distance will here dwell little on their different qualities sect xxix we have no colour that partakes more with light than white or that comes nearer to the air which shews it to be weak and fading nevertheless you may use it for the nearest parts of your picture or bring it out towards von by the assistance of some heavier and stronger colour or by mingling them together sect xxx blue js the most fading or rather the weakest coloar of all whence the sky and distant prospects are of that colour but it will fade the more the more it is mixd with white .ect xxxi pure black is the heaviest and the most terrene of all and the more you mix it with other colours the more will they be of the same nature now the different natures of black and white pro duce different effects in them for often the white throws back the black and the black brings forward the white under white we here comprehend all the light light codoure and uader black we fuppose all that are heavy uitramarine is then colour weak and light oaker is not quite so much masticoat is very light and so is vorditer vermillion and carmine are next to them orpiment and gamboge axe à little less so lake holds mean more kind than rude pink is of ino parricular class and easily takes the qualities of the others so you may mako it dark and heavy by mixing it with colours which are so and on the contrary faint weak or fading by mingling with it white or elue brown red umber the dark greens and bistre are the heaviest and next to black sect xxxii able masters who are vers ’ in perspective and the harmony of colours take care always to use their strong colours for their fore grounds and the weaker for di¬ stant views as for the union of colours you may by mingling them together understand the friendship or aversion they have for each other and thence take your hints and consult the pleasure of the eye sect xxxiii far laces foint and the like lay on first mixture of blue black aàd white as for linnens then heigh- ten the pactern flovers or flourishes wich white on- ly thensshade and finifh wic the first colour when they are upon flesn or ought else which you would have to be seen through them finish what is under them as if you intended to lay nothing thereon and then lay on the lace or point with pure white and fi- nish with the other mixture sect xxxiv if you would paint fur lay on ground as for drapery according to the colours of it and then shade by part iii by the same rule and having done you muft instead of stippling draw fine strokes this way that way and ’ other way according to the grain of the fur you aim at heighten the lights of brown fur with oaker and white and those of light far with white and little blue sect xxxv for building if it be stone take indigo biftre and white for your dead colouring or ground and then shade with less of this last and more of the bistre than indigo according to the colour of the stones you woald make you may also add little oaker both to begin with and to finish but to add still to its beauty you must here and there especially for ruins imake yellow and blue tints the former of oaker and the latter oful¬ tramarine always mixing them with white whether for your first ground provided they appear through what you lay upon them or whether you use them last ¬ nishing and blending them with the rest sect xxxvi for wooden buildings as they are of very different kinds they are left to discretion but the most com- mon way is to begin with mixture of oaker bistre and white and finish without white or with very little and when the snades require strength with bistre alone for otheri you may add sometime vermillion and sometimes green or black in word according to what you intend you must mix your co- lour and finish with stippling as for draperies and ill the rest chap iii of carnations or flesb colouring sect here is so great variety of colouring for flesn that it is hard matter to lay down any general rules for vour instraction therein nor are any rules minded by such as have acquired skill this way for such copy from originals or work by their own heads without knowing particularly why or where- fore so that the most able hands who work on with the least thought and trouble wonld be so much the harder put to it were they called upon to aliign rea¬ fon for their doctrine and practice as to their colouring and tints however as beginners for whom this little work is intended stand in need of immediate instruction will here in general declare how you are to paint the different sorts of flesh sect ii first of all having drawn your figure with carmine and adjusted your piece you must lay on for women children and in general for all soft and tender colour- ing white mix ’ with very little blue sor faces the composition of which will be given hereafter but it must hardly appear sect iii and for men instead of blue substitute vermillion for your dead colouring and when they are old let it be mix ’ with oaker then you are to run over all your features with ver- million carmine and white mingled together and with the same mixture form all the shades adding white as they weaken and scarce using any of it as they strongthen bat particularly in certain places where you must lay it on boldly for example at the cor- ners of the eyés under the nose the ears under the chin between the fingers in all the joints the cor- ners of the nails and generally every part where it is necessary to expresssa separation in the dark shades nor must you fear to give them all the strength they ought to have from the arst sketch because in working thereon with green it constantly weakens the red whick had first been laid on sect drawn with red make blue tints with ul tramarine agd ’ good deal of white upon the temples bengath ahd at the corners of the eyes on each side of of the mouth above it and below it little upon the midèle-of the forehead between the nose and the eyes on ghe fides of che cheeks on the neck and other parts where the flesh has bluishi cast you must also make xellowish tints with oaker orpiment and liitle vermillion mixed with white above the eye-brows ât the sides of the nose towards the bottomn little beneath-the cheeks and the other parte- near in these it is-that you must keep watchful eye upon nature for painting baing no more than an imitation ef nature every deviation from her is blemishi and -tru- ly fault sect vi having dead teeloured drawn and dispofed of vour tints you must proëeed to shade stippling with green for your flesn mixing therewith according to the rule we have-given for tints alittie blue for the fading parts and and on the contrary little yellow for the stronger parts or such as are nearest to you on the extre- mities of the fhades next to the lights you must im¬ perceptibly blend your colour with the ground of the flesn first with blue and then with red accord- ing to the- part you are upon and if this mixture of green do not darken enough at first you must go over the shades at several repetitions sometimes with red sometimes with green and always stippling till the whole be as is ought to be sect vii and if with these colours you cannet give your shades all the strength they ought to have you may finish the darkest parts with orpiment oaker or vermillion and sometimes with bistre only according to the colouring you would make but lightly laying it on very thin sect viii you must stipple upon the lights with little ver- million or carmine mixed with good deal of white and very little oaker to lose them with into the shades and make the tints imperceptibly die away into sach other taking heed while you are stippling or hatch- ing that your strokes follow the out-line of the flesh for altho your hatching must cross in all directions that ought to appear little more because it rounds off the parts and because thismixture might make the colouring too red if it was always used you must moreover endeavour to confound the tints and the shades with blue little green and great deal of white so that it be very pale but with this you must not work upon the checks nor upon the extremities of the lights no more than with the other mixture upon these last which are to be left in all their brightness as certain parts of the chin of the nose upon the forehead and upon the cheeks which and the chin ought however to be redder than the rest reft as well as the feet the inside of the hands the fingers and the toes pray observe here that these two last mixtures onght to be so very pale that you should hardly see yourself work they being purely designed to soften the piece to melt the tints into each other to blend the shades with the lights and to deface the lines be cautions not to make much use of the red mixture upon blue tints nor of blue upon others but change colour trom time to time as you perceive you work too blue or too red ’ till the piece be finisn ’ sect ix you must shade the white of the eves with the same blue and little flesn colour and make the corners on the sides of the nose with vermillion and white with sinall stroke of carmine all this is softened with that mixture of vermillion carmine and white and very litt oaker the lris of the eye must be mixture of ultrama- rine and white this little more in quantity than the ther adding thereto little bistre if it is to be of kind of light hazel or little black if it is too grey the pupil or sight of the eye is done with black and the lris is shaded with indigo bistre or black accord- ing to the colour it is of but of what colour soever it is you would do well to draw sine circle of vermillion round the sight which blended with the rest in finishi- ing gives life to the eye the circumierence of the eyes that is the slit and the lafhies must be done with bistre and carmine when they are strong particularly the upper part which must be afterwards softened with the red or blue mixtures formerly mentioned that the whole appear of piece and continu when this is done give à small touch of pure white upon the sight of the eye next to the light which makes it shine and alive you may also heighten the white of the eye next to the light sect the mouth must be vermillion mix with white and finish ’ with carmine which is softned like the rest and when the carmine does not prove dark enough for your purpose mix bistre with it this is to be under- stood of the corners between the lips and particularly for some half open mouths sect xi the hands and the other nudities are to be done as the faces observing that the tip or end of each finger be redder than the rest your work being coloord and stippled you must go over all the separations of the parts with sine touches of carmine and orpiment together as well in the shades as in the lights but stronger in the first and then handle them away into the rest of the flesn sect xii the eye-brows and the beard are colour ’ like the shades of the flesh and are finish ’ with bistre oaker or black according to the colour they are of drawing them with sine strokes as they ought to lie in exact imi¬ tation of nature and the lights must be heighten ’ with oaker bistre little vermillion and good deal of white sect xiii for hair lay on bistre oaker white and little vermillion but when it is very dark you must use black instead of oaker and then shade with the same mixture diminishing from the white and finish with bistre alone- or mix ’ with oaker or black by fine thin strokes very near to each other waving and curling them according to the turn of the hair you must also refresh the lights with sine strokes of oaker or orpiment or white and little vermillion after which blend away the lights into the shades working so metimes with brown and sometimes with pale as for the hairs upon and round the forehead through which the flesn is seen you must colour them with the colour of fleffi shading and working beneath as if yon intended there should be none then shape them and fi¬ nisn them with bistre and refresh the lights as you did the rest grey hairs are colourd with white black and bistre and finished with the same mixture bat stronger heightening the lights with very pale blue and white sect xiv but the matter of the greatest importance is to soften the work to run the tints intp one another as well as the hair on and about the face into the flesn taking especial care that you work not dry or hard and that the out lines of your flesn be not cus you must accustom yourself to mix with white bat just as you want more or less of it for the second co- louring must be always little deeper than your first ex- oept it be for softning sect xv the various colourings may be easily produc ’ by taking more or lefs red blue yellow or bistre whe- ther for your first colouring or for finishing the co- louring for women should be bluish for children little red both fresh and gay and for the men it should in¬ cline to yellow efpecially when they are old sect xvi to make colouring to represent death you must first clap in white orpiment and oaker very pale and then proceed with vermillion and lake instead of carmine and great deal of white and work thereon with green mixture in which is more blue than of any other colour that the fleffi may be livid the tints must be the same as for anocher colouring but you must have more of them blue than yellow particularly for the retreating parts and about the eyes and the yellow must be us ’ only for the parts which advance the farthest out they are made to die away into each ther after the usual manner sometimes with very pale blue and sometimes with oaker and white and little vermillion softning the whole together yoa must round off the parts and the out-lines with the same colours the mouth must be almost purple bat neverthe- less you begin upon it with little vermillion oaker and white but you finish it with lake and blue and for the strong strokes you take bistre and lake which are used also for the eyes the nose and the ifit is crucifix or some martyr where there must be an appearance of blood after the flesn is finished you niust colour with vermillion and finish with carniine fwelling out the drops of blood and giving them roundness as for the crown of thorns lay on sea-green and masticoat and shade with bistre and green and refrests the lights with masticoat sect xvii iron is coloured with indigo and litte black and white and finifhed with indigo alone heightening with white sect xviii for fire and flames the lights must be masticnat and orpiment and for the shades mix vermillion and carmine sect xix smoke is imitated with black indigo and white and sometimes bistre you may also add vermilli- on or oaker according to the colour you would have it of sect xx for pearls lay on mixture of white and little bluc and shade them and swell them with the same but little stronger lay on small white spot just in the mièdle of the light side and on the other between the shade and the border of the pearl give touch of masti- coat to make reflection underneath you must give them cast of the colour they are upon sect xxi diamonds must be laid in quite black then heighten- ed with gentle touches of white on the light side the same must be done for all other precious stones only varying the colour sect xxii for gold figure lay on shell- gold and shade with gall stone do the samefor silver only shade with indigo sect xxiii thus have dwelt upon some small articles for the assistance of beginners what have said may afford some light into what have not said by the help of time and practice which are much required to attain any degree of perfection in our art one excellent way to become master is copying after well-chosen origi- nals it is with pleasure we reap the fruit of the la- bours of others much is required to be able to produce such sine effects in short it is far better to be good copist than bad inventor the instructions have laid down for the mixtures and the different tints for the finishing of flesh and ther things may be of particular use when you work after prints where you have nothing before you but black and white and they will not be much more un- useful when you begin to copy after paint tho you know not how to handle your colours and happen not to be acquainted with their power and effect for there is this difference between miniature and painting in oil that in this last the colours were taken off from the pallet just as they appear to you in the picture so that in this case you have nothing to consult but such light and such shade now it is far from being the same in miniature where often it happens that the last colouring you lay on does not preserve its colour but partakes of the colouring benaath or rather the one than the other compose new one to form the effect you aim at for althor it be white green carmine blue orpiment bistre and the like which form your colouring they nevertheless would not produoe it if they were mixed to- gether for it is by proceeding from one to the other that you can succeed and when you have piece of this kind before you without having seen how it was done you must be conjurer at least to guefs at the order and method it was done in without the help of ma- ster or book upon this consideration have appli- ed my self to instruct you in so many small matters and flatter my self that experience will evince to all such as are able to make use of them that as small as they are they are valuable chap iv of landscapes sect it is particularly for landscapes that you must be mindful of tke s article and of the following which speak of the various qualities of colours because the order and disposition of them contributes much to the retreats and distances which deceive the eye and the greatest masters in this branch of the art have ever observed to cover their fore fronts with tne hea- viest and ftrongest colours reserving the lighter for di- stances bat that may not err from my purpose will instead of general instructions endeavour to give be- ginners some particular documents to be observed in practice sect ii first of all having drawn your landscape such as you would have it as for another pictare you must colour your nearest fronts if they ars to be dark with sap green lris green bistre and little verditer to give your colour body you must stipple with this mixture but let it be à little darker adding thereto sometimes blaek for the lighter fronts lay on oaker and white then sbade and finish with bistre in fome you fhiould mingle little green especially for shading and finifhing sometimes you have reddishi fronts which must be made of brown-red white and little green and finished with the same with the addition of little more green for grafs and herbage on your nearest fronts you must after they are drawn colour them with sea-green verditer and little white and for such as are yellow- iffi you must mingle masticoat and then fhade with iris green or bistre and gall-stone if you would have them appear dead and withered the fronts at some distance must be coloured with verditer then they must be shaded and finished with sap green and add bistre to give touch with here and there such as are still farther off are made of sea green little blue and little white and are shaded with verditer the further they are off the more bluish they must be and the utmost verge should be ultramarine and white mixing in certain places fine tints of ver- million sect iii waters are painted with indigo and white and shad- ed with the same but it must be stronger and to finish them them you must instead of stippling draw waving strokes when necessary or strait without crossing for still water you must sometimes use little green and heighten the lights with pure white particularly where the water bubbles up- you must proceed with rocks as with stone archi- tecture except that you mingle little green in your colouring and shading in this case your tints must be yellow and blue and- in finishing must be scumbled into the rest and when you make little branches with moss on them or herbs of any fort vou must when you have done touch them up with masticoat and green you may make some yellow some green and some reddish as upon the near fronts rocks must be stip- pled like the rest and the farther they are off the grayer must they appear castles old ruins and buildings of stone and wood must be ordered as have already directed when they are upon the fore fronts but when they are at di- stance you must add brown red and vermillion with great deal of white and shade very tenderly with this mixture and the farther they are off the tenderer must the strokes be for the separations as they are gene- rally slated you may make the roofs little bluer than sect iv the trees are not touched till the sky is finished so that when you are abont the sky you may if you will leave room for them especially if they are to be many in number but which way soever you order this you must cover such as are nearest to you with verditer ad- ding sometimes oaker to it then shade with the same colours and little iris green then leaf them with stippling without crossing for it must be done with slight longish touches of darker and warmer colour which must all be directed to humour the branches by little tufts of somewhat darker colour as we have said then touch up the lights with verditer and masticoat forming your leaves after the same manner and when there are withered leaves or branches cover them with brown- brown red or gall- stone and white and finish with gall stone without white or bistre the trunks of trees must be coverd with oaker white and little green for the lights and for the shades mingle with black adding bistre and green for the one and ftor the other your tints must be yellow and blue and here and there you must bestow tender touches of white or masticoat to imitate what you com- monly see in the bark of trees the branches which appear between the leaves must be oaker verditer and white or bistre and white according to your degree of light you must shade with bistre and iris green trees at distance are covered with verditer and sea- green and are shaded and finish ’ with the same colours mixed with lris green when there are any that ap- pear yellowiss they may be cover ’ with oaker and white and finish ’ with gall stone for those at the greatest distance and very far off cover with sca-green and to finish mix with it ultra- marine heighten the one and the other with masticoat in little distinct leaves it is the most difficult thing in landscape painting and likewise in miniature to leaf tree as it ought to be to obtain this art you must break your hand to it little by copying good originals for it requires peculiar manner of touching which can not be attain- ed but by working after trees themselves around which you will take care also to have little branches or sprays which you must leaf upon whatsoever they happen to lye whether the sky or the ground of the landscape in general and in general your landscape must be properly colour ’ and full of truth for tkerein consists its beauty chap of flowers sect it is most charming to paint flowers not only be- cause of their lustre but also because they take up but little time and require hardly any pains to do them it is all pleasure and no trouble you spoil face if you make one eye little higher than the other if you make small nose or large mouth and so on of the other features but the fear of these dispropor- tions never troubles the mind when you are about flow- ers for except they be quite out of the way indeed you spoil nothing and accordingly most of the quality who apply themselves to painting concern themselves with nothing but flowers you must however learn to copy little axactly and for this branch of miniature as well as for the rest refer to dame nature as your only guide work then after natural flowers and search for their tints and various colours upon your pallet little use will easily bring you to be expert in this and in order to pave the way for you at first will shew you continuing my design how to paint some of them it is not always you can have natural flowers and you may be often obliged to copy from prints where you see nothing but graving sect ii it is general rule that flowers be drawn and co- vered like other figures but the manner of colouring and finishing them is different for they are coloured with broad strokes or touches which have the turn the smaller must have with which you finish this first turn being principal help and to finisn instead of stip- pling or hatching you draw sine strokes very close to each other without crossing going over them at several repetitions till your lights and shades have all the strength you would give them sect iii roses having calked and drawn the red rose with carmine let your first lay be very pale mixture of carmine and white then lay in the shade of the same colour but with less white and at last use carmine alone but it must be very thin at first adding however to the bo- dy of it more and more as the piece advances and that the shades grow darker and darker and this is to be done with broad bold strokes to conclude you finisn with the same colour with sine strokes which must be turn- ed like those of the graving if you copy after print or like the turn of the leaves of the rose if you copy after painting or nature scumbling the whole and touching up the strongest lights and the edges of the brightest leaves with white and little carmine you mutt always make the heart of the rose and the shady side darker than the rest and use little indigo in shading the first leaves especially when your roses are blown to make them appear little fading the seed is done with gamboge mixed with little bladder green for shading your streaked roses must be paler than the others that the streaks may be the more conspicuous which must be done with carmine somewhat deeper in the shades and very bright in the lights hatching continu- ally with sine strokes for white roses lay on white and proceed and frnish as in the example of red roses but with black white and little bistre and make the seed somewhat yellower than before for yellow roses lay on masticoat and shade with gamboge gall- stone and bistre heightening the lights with masticoat and white the stalks the leaves and the buds of all sorts of roses must be laid in with verditer mixed up with little litile masticoat and gamboge and to snade them use lris green with less of the other colours when the shades are deep the wrong side of the leaves must be bluer than the other therefore you must there lay on green and mix it with iris-green to fhade with making the veins or ribs of that side lighter than the ground and those of the right side deeper the prickles upon the stalks and the buds of the roses are made with slight touches of carmine in all directions and those on the stem of the tree and larger branches are struck in with verditer and carmine and shaded with carmine and bistre making also the bot- tom of the stems aad stalks more reddish than the tops that is you must mix green with carmine and bistre to stinde wich sect iv of tulips as there are infinite forts of talips at least too many to be all traeed out sfiall touch only on the finest which are call striped or streaked their stripes or streaks are laid in with carmine very thin in some places and very deep in others and they are finish ’ with sine strokes of the same colour which must all ob¬ serve the turn of the stripes for others you begin with vermilhion then proceed by mixing it with car- mine and finifh with carmine only for others again you lay indian lake upon vermil- lion instead of carmine some also are coloured with lake and carmine mixed together and lake only or with white to begin with some of them are of violet or purple colour and are to be done with ultramarine and carmine or lake sometimes bluer and sometimes redder the manner of ordering both is just the same there is no difference but in the colours you must in certain places as for example between the stripes of vermillion carmine or lake put some- times blue made of ultramarine and white and some- times transparent parple which must be finifh ’ wich sine hair strokes like the rest and scumbled into the stripes some there are that have fallow tints which are made of lake bistre and oaker according as they happen to be these are only for fine and uncommon tulips to shade the ground of those whose stripes are car- mine take indigo and white for those that have lake stripes take black and white therewith sometimes mixing bistre at other timen green some also you may shade with gamboge and umber and always with sine hair strokes that follow the turn of the leaf others also may be painted which we call edged this tulip is al of one colour excepting the border which is white with purple red with yellow yellow with red and red with white the purple tulip of this bordered sort is laid in with uitramarine carmine and white and you must with the same snade and finisn the edge or bor- der must not be touched that is you must only lay on thin white which must be shaded with very thin indigo the yellow is colour ’ with gamboge and is shaded with the same colour oaker umber or bistre the edging must be vermillion and finish ’ with very little carmine the red is laid in with vermillion and finish ’ with the same colour adding thereto carmine or lake the border must be gamboge and to finisn add to it gall- stone or umber or bistre the white is to be shaded with black blue and white indian ink is very proper in this case forit shades soft and is alone equal to the effects of blue and white mix' with other black the edging of this white tulip must be carmine for for all these sorts of tulipe you must in the middle of the leaves express nervure which must be much brighter than the rest and you must scumble the edges into the grounds by fine strokes for they must not seem cut or separated like the stripes others there are of still different colours when vou meet with any which are as it were black with infide you colour and finisn them with indigo as well as the seed if the ground be yellow take gamboge and fi- nish by adding thereto umber or bistre the leaves and stalks of tulips are commonly paint- ed with sea green and shaded and finish ’ with iris- green with broad strokes along the leaves some also may be made with verditer mix with masticoat and these may be shaded with bladder green that they may be of more yellowisni cast sect of anemonies there are many forts of this flower as well double as fingle which last are commonly plain and are either purple with purple and white shaded with the same colour some bluer some redder sometimes very pale and sometimes very deep others are coloured with lake and white and finish ’ with the same diminishing the white or even ufing none at all others again are coloured with vermillion and shaded with the same colour deepen ’ with carmine others once more are white and lemmon-colour these last are done with masticoat and both the one and the other must be shaded and finish ’ sometimes with vermillion and sometimes with very deep lake and especially at the bottom of the cup about the seed which is also often of blackisn colour and is imitated with indigo or with black and blue mingling in some little bistre and working continually with sine strokes and scumbling the shades into the lights there are some that have the bottom of the cup much brighter than the rest and even so as to be quite white altho ’ the rest of the anemony be deep the seed of all these anemonies is imitated with indi- go and black with very little white shade with indigo alone sometimes it must be heighten ’ with masticoat double anemonies are of very various colours bux the finest of them have their largest leaves strip ’ some of these stripes are perform ’ with vermillion to which is added carmine to finish them shading the rest of the leaves with indigo for the smaller leaves within lay on mixture of vermillion and white and shade them with vermillion mixed with carmine and here and there be very strong. particularly in the heart or cabbage near the great leaves on the shady side and finisn with hair strokes of carmine which must humour the stripes and the turn of the leaves the stripes of others are coloured and finished with carmine only as well as the inner or smaller leaves observing however to leave in the midst of these last littie round where you must lay in deep purple or violet which must be scumbled into the rest and the whole being finished lay on broad strokes of this same colour around the smaller leaves especially on the dark side and scumble them into the greater which must for the rest be shaded with indigo or black in some others the smaller leaves are of lake or purple altho the stripes of the greater be car- mine there are others whose stripes are carmine in the middle of most of the largeft leaves with vermillion under it in some places all which must be scumbled in¬ to the shades of the ground which are of indigo and white the smaller leaves are laid in with masticoat and are shaded with very deep carmine on the dark side and very bright carmine on the light side leaving here the masticoat almost to itself and only dividing the leaves with fine touches of orpiment and carmine which smaller leaves may be sometimes fhaded with little very pale green there are double anemonies all red and of vio- let colour the first are coloured with vermillion and carmine with hardly any white and are shaded with carmine alone well gumm ’ that they may be very deep purple anemonies are imitatad with purple and white and are finifhed without white in short there are of all colours of these double anemo- nies as well as of the single which are to be painted by the rules here suggested the green of both the one and the other must be verditer mixed with masticoat for the dead colouring and it must be finish ’ with bladder green their stalks incline to be little reddifni therefore they are shaded with carmine mixed with bistre and sometimes with green after they are laid in with masticoat sect vi of pinxs and carnations it is the same with pinks and carnations as with anemonies andtulips for some of them are wariegat- ed or mixed with several colours and some are of pne colour alone the first are sometimes streak ’ strip ’ or mark sometimes with vermillion and carmine and sometimer with lake and carmine at ofher times with pure lake or with white some aredeep others are pale some- timés they are variegated with small or narrow strokes sometimes with broad or great their grounds are commonly shaded with indigo and wbite there are some of these flowers of very pale fleff colour and variegated with another deeper made of vermillion-and lake others are of lake and white which are shaded and variegated without white others again are all red with vermillion and carmire ass deep as pollible others once more are all lake in short others there are of great variety which nature herself or your own fancy can best guide you to the green of all of them if of the sea hue which shade with iris-green sect vii of the many-flower lily let your first colour be mine de plomb the vermil- lion and in the strongest of the shades carmine and finish with the same in strokes which correspond with the turn of leaf heighten the lights with mine de plomb and white and imitate the seed with vermillion and carmine the greens must be verditer shaded with iris- green sect viii of the day-lily there are three sorts of this flower gridelin little reddisn gridelin very pale and white for the first lay on lake and white and shade and finish with deeper mixtare of the same adding thereto little black to sadden it especially for the deepest pla- ces for the second lay on white mix ’ with very little lake and vermillion so that these two last do hardly appear then shade with black and little lake observing to be redder in the heart of the leaves next to the stalk which as well as the seed must be of the same colour particularly towards the top and lower litie greener the stalk of the seed must be masticoat shaded with bladder-green the other flowers of this fort are laid on with white only and are shaded and finished with black and white the stalk of these last and the green of them all must be of the sca fort shaded with iris-green sect ix hyacintrs they are of four forts deepish blue paler blue gridelin and white the first must be ultramarine and white shaded and finished with less white the second must be of paler blue the third must be lake and white and very little uitramarine and must be finish ’ with the same colour but of deeper degree in short the fourth must be all white and then shad- ed with black and little white finish with strokes of the same turn with the qut line of the leaf the green and stalk of the blue kind must be of the sea sort shaded with deep lris and in the stalk of the first you use à little carmine to give it reddisti cast the stalks of the two others and their greens must be coloured with verditer and masticoat shaded with bladder green sect of the piony let your first lay in general be of indian lake and white of pretty good bady and then shade with lesser quantity of white which you must quite disuse in the deepest places this done finisn with strokes of the same colour inthe manner we have so often intimat- ed charging it strongly witn gum in the darkest shades and heightening the lights and edges of the brightest leaves with white and little lake you must also express small veins just like the strokes of hatching but they must appear more the green of this flower must be of the sea kind and shaded with the iris sect xi of cowslips they are of four or five colours of very pale purple of gridelin of white and yellow the purple must be laid on with uitramarine car- mine and white observing to diminisn the quantity of this last when you are fhading the gridelin-coloured must be painted with light lake very little ultramarine and greât deal of white shade with the same but lêt it be darker for the white sort let it be white alone and shade with black and white strokes the eye of these three cowstips must be done with mastieoat in form of star which is shaded with gamboge and must in the midst of it have fmali round of bladder green the yellow cowssip must be masticoat shaded with iiii gamboge and umber the buds and leaves the stems must be verditer mixed with little masticoat and finished with iris- green with this same colour expressing ribs or veins on the leaves and heightening the lights of the largeft with masticoat xii of ibo renunculus.. there are many forts of this-flouer the finest of which are reddisn and orange-colour ’ for the fick use vermillion wich veryt small quantity of gamt boge adû carmine to shade wath land ifinifh with tkis last colour and lietle gall stonal for others use indian lake iastead of carmine but especially at the heart the orange coloured may be imitated with gam- boge finished with gall-stone vermillion and little carmine leaving some yellow stripes and spots the green of the stalks is verditer and masticoat very pale to which must be added lris-green to shade with the leaves must be of deeper green sect xiii of tbe crocus it is of two colours the yellow and the purple the yellow is done with masticoat and gall-stone shaded with gamboge and gall-stone expressing on the outside of each leaf three lines of rays separate from and parallel to each other with bistre and pure lake which must be scumbled into the strokes of the ground or leaf the inside of the leaves must be all yellow for the furple lay on carmine mixed with little uitramarine and white expressing deep purple stripes on fome of the leaves as you did for the yellow and on others only fine veins the seed of all is yellow and must be done with orpiment and gall stone and for the stalk lay on white and shade with black mixed with little green the green of this flower is pale verditer shaded with bladder green sect xiv of the ir persian or indian iris is done by eovering the in- nermost leaves with white and shading them with indigo and green mixed together and leaving small white separation in the middle of each leaf on the outermost leaves vou in ’ the same part put on lay of masticoat which must be shaded with gall-stone and orpiment making small deep and longifh dots or spots at some small distance from each other upon the upper side of all the leaf and at the end of each leaf make large spots of bistre and lake for some and of indigo alone for others but very deep the rest aed the outside of the leaves must be shaded with black the green must be of the sea fort and masticoat very pale and shaded with bladder green another sort of lris is laid on with purple and white mixed up with litile more carmine than ultramarine and for the shades but especially for the middle leaves be mindful to diminish the quantity of white and on the contrary to what has been said let the uitramarine prevail over the carmine expressing veins with this same colour and leaving in the middle of the leaves within- side small yellow nervure others there are that have this same nervure on the first leaves whose end only is bluer than the rest others again are shaded and finished with redder purple and have also nervure in the middle of the leaves without but it is white and shaded with indigo some of them are yellow and are done with lay of orpiment and masticoat shaded with gall stone with veins of bistre on the upper side of the leaf the greens of them all must be of the sca-colour which must be mixed with little masticoat for the stems and stalks and shaded with bladder-green sect xv ofjessemin is done with lay of white shaded with black and white for the outside of the leaves add little bistre giving the half of each on that side faint reddiffi cast with carmine of the tuberose lay on white and shade with black and little bistre in some places and for the outside of the leaves mix à little carmine to give them reddishi tint par- ticularly towards the ends the seed must be masticoat shaded with bladder- green the green of the leaves and stalks must verditer shaded with tris-green sect xvii of hellebore the flower of hellebore is done by almost the same rules we have given for the tuberose that is it is laid on with white and shaded with black and bistre mak- ing the outside of the leaves little reddishi here and there the seed must be deep green heightened with masticoat its green is sad and is imitated with be verditer masticoat and bistre finished with iris-green and bistre sect xviii of the lilt be covered with white and shade with blaeg and white the seed orpiment and gall stone the green like that of the tuberose sect xix of the snow-drop cover and finish as for the lily let the seed be masticoat shaded with gall stone let the green be verditer and lris sect xx of the junquil lay on masticoat and gall-stone finish with gam- boge and gall stone the leaves and stalks sea-green shaded with iris- green sect xxi te narcissus for all of this flower of the yellow sort whether double or single let your first lay be masticoat then gamboge and finish by adding thereto umber or bistre excepting however the cup or bell in the middle which must be done with orpiment and gall-stone and edged with vermillion and carmine for the white sort be covered with white and shade with black and white excepting the cup afore said which must be done with masticoat and gamboge the green sea shaded with iris sect xxii the marigold let your first lay be masticoat the second gamboge and ’ shade with this last mingled with some vermillion to finish add gall stone and little carmine the green verditer shaded with lris ’ sect xxiii thefrengh maricold lay on first masticoat secondly gamboge then proceed with gall stone mixed with this last finisn with this last colour adding thereto bistre and very little carmine forthe deepest snades sect xxiv the african marigold lay on gamboge shade with the same mixing there- wth good deal of carmine and little gall-stone but about the leaves make an edging of gamboge very bright in the lights and darker in the snades the seed is shaded with bistre the green of both these last must be verditer shad- ed with iris sect xxv the sun flower be coyered with masticoat and gamboge and finisn with gall stone and bistre the green must be laid on with verditer and masti- coat and shaded with bladder-green sect xxvi the pass rose like the french marigold and the green of the leaves the same but their veins must be of deeper green sect xxvii the scabious there afe two forts of the scabious red and purple the leaves of the first are indian lake with little white and in the middle where there is à large pod or bud which holds the seed it is to be coloured and finish- ed with lake only but with the addition of little uitramarine or indigo to make it darker then make little longish spots of white for the upper part at pretty good distance from each other but forget not to let them be stronger in the lights and weaker in the shades and to make them true in all directions for the others be covered with very pale purple as well on the leaves as on the receptacle or pod in the middle shadingboth with the same colour of deeper dye and instead of using small white strokes for the seed let them be purple and make round about each and that all over the pod the green verditer and masticoat shaded with iris green sect xxviii the gladiola lay on columbin lake and white very pale then proceed and finish with lake only very bright in some places and very deep in others ever adding therete bistre for the strongest shades the green verditer shaded with iris sect xxix tbe liver-wort it is sometimes red and sometimes blue for this last be covered all over with uitramarine white and litile carmine or lake shade the inside of the leaves with this mixture but let it be deeper except for the outermost for which and the outside of all you must make an addition of indigo and white that the coloar may be deadned for the red lay on columbin lake and white very pale and finish with less white the green verditer masticoat and little bistre shade with lris and litte bistre but chiefly for the sect xxx tbe pome-granate blossom for this lay on mine de plomb shade with vermil- lion and carmine and finisn with this last the green verditer and masticoat shade with iris sect xxxi the blossom of the indian bean lay on indian lake and white shade the middle leaves with lake only but thereto add adittle ultra- marine for the rest the green verditer shade with lris sect xxxii the larks-spur or heel it is of several colours and striped the most com¬ mon are purple gridelin and red sect xxxiii violets and paunsies ot pansies the same may be said of these except that for these last the two middle leaves are bluer than the rest that is towards the border for the infide of these is yellow with little black strokes or veins which dye away to- wards the middle sect xxxiv tbe imperial lilx it is of twe colours viz yellow and red or orange- colour for the first be coloured with orpiment and snade with gall stone and little vermillion for the seaend be eovered with orpiment and vermil- tion and shade with gall stone and vermillion making the beginning of the leaves next to the stalk of lake and bistre very deep and for all veins of this mix- ture along the leaves the green verditer and masticoat shaded with iris and gamboge sect xxxv the gilly.flower there are many forts of gilly-flowers as white yellow purple and strip streakd or variegated with several colours for the white be covered with white and shade with black and little indigo for the heart of the leaves for the yellow masticoat gamboge and gahl- stone the purple is done with purple and white you must finisn with leis white minding to be brighter in the heart and even little yellowishi for the red lake and white and finish without white for the striped or variegated lay on white and va- riegate sometimes with purple wherein uitramarine fredominates or sometimes with purple wherein car- mine prevails or lake sometimes with white at ther times without it fhading the rest of the leaves with indigo the seed of every one must be verditer and masticoat finished with lris the leaves and the stalks with the same green mix- ed with lris to shade with should never have done were lhere to dwell on all the flowers that may be painted but have said nough and even too much to instruct you fully in this branch of painting for ten or dozen examples had been sufficient for any oae who should begin to copy na- ture herself for in this case he has nothing to do bet ta imitate what he has befgre his eyes but imagin ’ it is more useful to copy after prints and that should un- dertake no ungrateful tafk did dwell on the method of colouring and finishing good number of flowers at least to conclude as began every one may take or leave what he sces proper sect xxxvi shall not here subjoin any particular instructions on an infinite number of other subjects for it were to little or no purpose and this little work is already mare diffuse than lat first intended it therefore only add in general that fruits fishes serpents and all sorts of reptiles must be touched after the manner of figures that is hatched or stippled but that birds and all the other animals must be finished with strokes after the man- ner of flowers sect xxxvii take heed to use no white lead for any of these things for its is good for nothing but oil turning as black as ink when tempered with gum-water only and especially if you put your work in damp place or where perfumes are instead thereof use ceruse of venice or flake white which is to the full as fine fear not to use this especially for your first colonrings but mix portion of it in all your compounds to give them certain body which strengthens your work and makes it appear warm and mellow painters however practise differently upon this head for some use but little of it and others none at all but the manner of these last is hard and dry others again nse it in abundance and these are certainly to be follow- ed as conforming to the most usual opinion of the most skilful artists for besides that it is the most ready you may thereby thing almost impossible to be done with- out it copy all sorts of pictures notwithstanding the contrary opinion of those who pretend that in minia- ture you can not come up to the strength and the differ- ent tints of pieces in oil mistake at least with refe- rence to good painters as is sufficiently evinced from the effects for we see figures landscapes portraits and every thing else in miniature touched in the grand man¬ ner with as much truth and as nobly altho ’ more prettily and delicately than in oil know indeed this kind of painting has its advan- tages were they only that it dispatches more in less time that it is more easily preserved and that it claims to be the eldest sister and boasts its antiquity but notwithstanding all this it must be granted that miniature has her advantages also and withont repeat- ing what lhave already said it is more neat and conveni- ent you may carry all your apparatus in your pocket you may work where you please without so much pre- paration you raay leave it and refume it just when and as often as you please which can not well be practised with the first in which you ought hardly ever to work dry the other as in comedy in which the greatest or the least perfection of the actors confists not in acting the higher or lower parts but in acting what they do act extreamly well for if he who acts the meanest charac- ter acquits himself better therein than he who acts the heroe of the play he will doubtless deserve greater measure of applause and the same is it in the art of painting for its excellence is not confined to the grandeur of one parti- cular subject but to the manner of treating it have you talent for this plunge not yourself rashily into that and if you have from heaven received some spark of the divine fire know for what end it was bestowed on you nor deviate from the path cut out for you some shall take the different airs of heads others shall succeed better in landscapes some shall work finely in small who could do little or nothing in great and others are good colourists but bad designers and others in short have hand for nothing but flowers to con- clude the bassans have rais ’ to themselves name for animals which they most excellently touched and much better than any thing else let every one therefore be contented with his genius nor presumie upon another ’ ground or attempt flight unequal to his strength it being in vain to strive againft nature and- imprudent and immodest in us to aim at what does not belong to us for we thereby uncover our own shame and work our own disgrace on the other hand it is no dishonour to you that you are not possess ’ of all the great talents which have ennobled all the great painters each of whom has had his blemishes as well as bcauties let us therefore again repeat it sit down quietly with the share allotted to us the great matter is to cultivate it with care and diligence and altho ’ this small tract may contribute to your assistance as it asfuredly will present it to you as no other than supplement to more immediate helps doubtless you wiil learn more effectually under the di- rection of an able master from whom you may imbibe all the sound precepts and true rules and see all made plain to you by practice now altho the contrivan- ces for drawing which in the beginning gave vou be infallible it were much better to have hand ex- pert thereat without any such servile helps for if you are not actuated by superior genins to guide you and if you have not most accurate eye in vain will be all your pains to adjust your pieces correctly and it will be mere chance if after all they are not lame and spirit- less for in laying on the colours you easily lose the strokes and with far more difficulty will you be able to re trace them if you are quite aukward at draw¬ do therefore most earnestly recommend it to al ing lovers of painting that they apply themselves to draw learnedly to copy with indefatigable perseverance and that this they always do most tenacioussy from good originals in word be satissy ’ to ascend regularly by those steps which lead up to the perfection of this fine art whose precepts as happens in all other arts are soon obtained but this is not enough you must execute also theory is of little worth without practice as practice without theory is blind guide who leads us astray instead of conducting us in the right road but to know well what you would do and to do well what you know is the true means of attaining your end greatly to increase in knowledge with time and to become the good scholar of an excellent master for my part iboast not of being such but however will venture to promise all those who shall be pleased to step into this my little school with never so little dis position and longing to learn that they will have no cause to repent themselves in their trouble for if they stay with pleasure flatter my self they will not go out as they came in the secret of an italian for making carmine and ultramarine an anonymous painter one who appears to have been sound and excellent judge express him- self to this effect concerning this arcanum nothing is more safe or easier than this manner of making these colours they have lustre viva- city not to be expressed they never change and may be prepared at so easy rate that for one pistole you may make as much as would cost you seven or oight at florence but the proof will confirm what here advance much more effectually than all can say carmine take pound of brasil-wood from fernambuco of the golden-colour and pounding it in mortar steep it for three or four days in bocal of white-wine vinegar then boil it for half an hour and passing it through cloth put it again over the fire in the mean time have another vessel or pot at hand in which shall be eight ounces of alom diluted in white-wine vine- gar which dilution pour into the other liquor and stir it about with spatula the froth or scum which will hereupon arise will be your carmine collect it there- fore and drv it this may be done with cochineal in- stead of brazil wood ultramarine ultramarine take ten ounces of linseed oil and pour them ina so an earthen-dishi with seven or eight drops of com- mon water and set it upon the fire where let it remain till it begins to fry or boil and then throw in pound of white virgin-wax broken into snall bits when the wax is melted throw in pound of greek piich and add thereto four qunces of powder of mastick which has been previoussy melted by it self together with two ounces of turpentine and let the whole melt over the fire for an hour together the hour expired pour this composition into cold water and if it prove soft like butter it is enough but if you feel any hard grains or grit conclude that your mastick is not sufficiently melt- ed and clap it over the fire again the whole being in due temper put blue lapis into crucible and let it remain in the fire till it be red hot like the fire itself and then throw it into white-wine vinegar which it will absorb till it burst and break into small bits which bray to powder and then incorpo- rate this powder with little of the above composition but let it be as little as possible and let it remain thus for about fortnight after this lay board little in- clined upon the edge of table it would be the more convenient if this board had trench or channel cut along it and under the foot of this board place glass vestel or receiver and put your blue paste at the head of it and above the same place vessel of water so that it may distil drop by drop upon the paste all things being disposed in this manner help the water to dilute the paste by stirring it very gently with the small the first blue which will come end of fmooth stick away drop by drop will prove the finest and when you perceive it to lose of its beauty change the recipi- ent for another to receive the second blue after which yau will have third which you may use very sasely set these three forts of uitramarine to dry then collect them and put them up separately in bags of white leather other secrets for making ultramarine after dif- ferent ways fine lakes and colom- bine lakes greens and other colours after different ways particularly adapt- ed to miniature ultramarine take half pound of lapis lazuli and lay it upon burning coals where let it remain till it be red hot and then quench it in very strong vinegar afterwards grind it upon some hard marble or stone with rectifi- brandy the more you grind it the siner will be your-uitramarine and being ground to your mind leave it upon the marble or put it into some vessel while you prepare your paste or pastel wherewith to incorporate your said lapis to make this paste take quarter of pound of yel- low wax quarter of pound of turpentine as much rofin and as much linseed-oil melt them all together over slow fire and when they begin to bubble they will be sufficiently done pour this melted compofition into glazed pans and it will be your ultramarine pa- stel or paste of which take quantity equal to that of your lapis and knead them together upon your marble that is your lapis and pastel together which being in- corporated leave them in that state for night to force out the uitramarine in the said pastel pour fair water upon it and knead it with your hands like so much dough and the uitramarine will squeeze out and fall into pot which must stand under your hands to receive it leave it then to settle in the said water till you perceive the ultramarine to be subsided another way take four ounces of linseed oil four ounces of new wax four ounces of arganson one ounce of rosin one ounce of mastic in tears four ounces of burgun- dy-pitch two drams of incense or frankincenie and two drams of dragon ’ blood bruise each ingredient by it self in mortar then put your linseed-oil in pan over the fire and when it begins to fry throw in your ingredients one after the other so that your dra- gon ’ blood be the last thrown in in the mean time con¬ tinually stirring the others with stick or spatula and when the whole becomes glutinou and stringy between your fingers your paste is fit for use then throw in your lapis lazuli having previoussy burnt it in coal fire quenched it in white wine-vinegar ground it when dry upon amarble and païs ’ it through very fine sive as has been before specified your lapis thus prepared and then incorporated with your pasté leave it in that state for twenty-four hours and then force out your uitramarine with spring water but use no other and knead well your paste wich this said water you will then have the first tincture or degree of your biue which will be the sinest and most lively of all con¬ tinue this to the third repetition and if after all you throw the remains into proper chemical vessel you may have the gold with which vour lapis was impreg- nated some theré are who knead their paste at once in vessel of milk warm water into which they squeeze their ultramarine which they leave to settle for twen ty- four hours and more when poaring off the water by inclination inclination they find the uitramarine at bottom and set it to dry in the sun sometimes they leave the la- pis incorporated in the paste for the space of month before they express or squeeze out the-uitramarine and in the said paste instead of linseed oil and turpentine substitute only oil of turpentine and black pitch instead of burgundy pitch as sor the lapis itself they heat it quench it grind it and searze it in the manner we have directed above fine lake take pound of good brazil which boil with three quarts of lye made of the ashes of vine-sprigs till it be half evaporated then let it settle and strain it off boil it over again with fresn brasil cochineal and terra-merita that is only half pound of brasil and half quarter of pound of cochineal with the fur- ther addition of another quart of fair water which must boil till it be also balf evaporated as before then left to settle and then strained as for the terra-merita you need have but an ounce of that when you take this liquid from the fire observe to throw into it an ounce of burnt alom reduc ’ to an impalpable powder and dissolve the same therein by stirring it with stick and adding thereto half dram of arsenic then to give it body take two cuttle-fisn bones pulverize them and throw them in leave it to dry up at leisure and then grind it with good quantity of fair water in which leave it to steep then strain it thro cloth and make it up into small tablets or cakes which set to dry on card or pasteboad if you would have your lake redder add to it lemon juice and if you would have it deeper add to it oil of tartar another lake take shavings or sheatings of scarlet and boil them in lye of the asnies of burnt tartar or oil of tartar which lye has the property of separating the scarlet when it has hoiled sufficiently take it off and add to it cochineal mastick in powder and little roch alom boil the whole over again and while it is het strain it two or three times through jelly-bag the first time squeezing the bag from top to bottom with two sticks then take out what remains behind in the bag and wasti it well pass the liquor you express ’ with the sticks thro ’ the bag again and you will have paste stick ing to the sides of the bag which you may spread out up- on paste- board or divide into small parcels upon paper and leave it to dry columbine-lake take three quarts of the most subtily distill vine- gar one pound of the finest brasil-wood of feraambuco which rasp and set it to steep in the said vinegar month at least and if longer so much the better then boil the whole in balneo mariae three or four wabbles dp and leave it for day or two after which prepare quarter part of alom-powder which put into very clean earthen-pan and upon it strain your liquor throt cloth and so let it remain for day then heat the whole till it fimmers and leaving it again for twenty- and thereupon pour your liquor which must be little warm stir then the whole with stick till it is cool and leave it again for twenty-four hours before you strain it observe that you must previoussy strain it up- on the alom before you pour it upon the cuttle-fisn bone the mare or dregs of columbine-lake to make fine purple colour befides the carmine for oil and for distemper take the dregs or mare of the columbine lake which subsides with the cuttle sisn bone and dry it and grind it there is no sine lake so splendid and if you mix it with lake you add to its body lris green take of the blueft flower-de luces otberwise called flag.iris strip off the upper or sattin part of them and keep only that the rest is good for naught and throw away even all the little yellow nervures pound them in mortar what you thus pick and being well pounded throw upon it à little water three or four spoonfuls more more or less according to your quantity of flowers previons to this you must have dissolved in this water little alom and gum-arabic but very little and then bray them well all together and strain the whole thro close cloth and put this juice into shells which dry in the air another way after you have pick the above-mentioned flowers pound them and put to them little alom-water as above directed throu in liule powder of quick lime as if you was salting sallad it has the property of changing the colour and cleansing it in fine express the juice into shells anotber way pound the same flowers in mortar expreis the juice into shells and salt the juice in each shell with alom little unequally that you may thence have greens of different shades anotber way still better pound alom and bruise french or avigaen berriss tuia them together with water and boil them ei her fire or an affi-heat till the water become very yellow ’ then pound flower-de-luces or the flag-lris in mortar and pour thereto à little of this yellow wa- ter in proportion as you would have it bright green or sad green then strain it thro cloth of goats hair for it would be the worse for passing thro linen and put the juice so strained or express ’ into large shells which expole to all the heat of the sun sor the green will become mouldly or mothery in the shade and prove too clammy another way take leaves of the flag-lris mince them very small and put them into some glafs ar earthen vessel or what would do better in some copper pot or pan with powdered alom and quick lime leave them to putrisy in this state for ten or twelve days being rotten squceze them into shells the green is more lively and rich when you only bray the leaves and express them at once once without giving them time to rot having previously salted them over with powdered alom anotber way aith the flower of violes the green made of the leaf of the march violet is done by the same method but you must have greater quantity of it and this is deeper green than that of the iris observe that instead of lime you may use french berries bruised with alom it exceeds lime for changing blae into green you may also make green with the flowers of pan- sies after the same manner bladder-green take the fruit or berry of the plant or bramble call' rhamnus poand it in morter anctbrow into it à little powdered alom then express the juice of it and put it up in bladder which tye close and leave it to dry till your green is hard french pink it is commonly made with the white of troye sther- wile call spaniss white and french ot avignon berries but it is apt to change colour so that it will be safer to make it of white lead or ceruse which grind very fine and dilute it upon marble whence take it up with wooden spatula and leave it to dry in the shady part of any room then take french berries bruise them in marble mortar with wooden pestle and boil them with water in leaded earthen-pot till third or more be evaporated strain this decoction thro ’ linnen- cloth and put into it the bignes of two or three small nuts of alom to hinder it from changing colour when it is dis- solved dilute the white with this decoction to the con -- sistence of pretty thick pap or rather paste which work well between your hands and make up into tro- chisks which set to dry in an airy room when it is dry dilute it again two or three times with the said decoction according as you woald have your pink bright or deep and leave it to dry each time till it be very dry observe that your liquor or decoction must be warm when you dilute your paste therewith and that you must make it afresti afresh wben the first is tainted taking heed hever to touch it with lron or steel but all along use wooden spatula how to make rigbt use of alom the best way of using alom for lris-green and the other compositions of colours which would change without this mineral is to break it small and to pat it into à little water over fire sor otherwise it would never dissolve and with this water sprinkle ver your flowers on the juice of your colours but the less alom the better for it burns when it is used too freely how te purify vermillion cinnabar or vermillion being compound of mer- cury and sulphur must be divested of the impurities it contracts from those minerals which imparities darken its lustre and causeit to change now this purificati- on is thus ordered grind the cinnabar in stone with fair water upon marble or porphyry put it into glass or earthen vessel to dry then put urine toit and mix it so that it be thoroughly wet and swim letit settle then and the cinnabar being precipitated or fallen pour off the urine by inelination and put frefhi in the room of it leaving it so all night and repeating the same change for sour or five days till the ciunabar be thoroughly purified continue your process with beating up the white of an egg which mixing with sair water pour it upon your cinnabar and stir the whole about with walnut tree-stick change this liquor two or three times as above and keep the vessel well stopped up or closely covered tor fear of dust which would spoil -your cinnabar and when you would use it temper it with gum-water with this it will not change its colour another way grind cinnabar previoussy pulverized upon pro- phyry with the urine of child or with brandy and dry it in the shade if vou would entirely divest it of all its obscurity and give it- brighter or redder countenance infuse in the brandy either urine or little saffron and with this liquor grind your cinnabar memorandum for making verp fine poliss gold the pieces of wood you would gild whether frames borders or ought else must be very smooth- and to make them the more so païs sez-dog ’ -skin over them then you must glue or size it with stuff made of the cuttings of white gloves and lay on nine or ten layers of white when it is thoroughly dry when it is per- fectly dry use your shave grass that it may be so much the kinder and then warm some size and water into which dip fine piece of linnen which wring and with it rub the white then lay on two or three layers of gold-colour and more if it be not of good body or deep enough and when it is dry rub it soundly with dry cloth till it be bright again then take of the strongest brandy you can find and wasn the gold- colour with this brandy by the help of pencil but you must have your leaf gold cut and ready upon the cushion to clap it on the moment the pencil is gone over the part and when it is dry polisn it with dog ’ tooth te make glove leather size take pound of the cuttings of white gloves and let it steep in water some time then boil it in pot with twelve quarts of water till it be reduced eo two quarts then strain it thro ’ cloth into new earthen- pan to know if your size is strong enough try when it is cooled if it feels firn under your hand to make the white the size being done take crayon white and serape it with knite or grind it upon marbie melt and heat your size to violent degree then taking it trom the fire throw in white enongh to give it the confist- ence of pap leave it to infuse for quarter of an hour then stir and mix it wich hog ’ hair brush take this white and add more size to it that it may be the thinner lor the first and second goings over observe that your first lay be dry belore you cover it with the second ifit be wood vou are upon it will re- quire twelve-fold repetition but for pastboard six or seven will be enoagh this done take water and into it dip soft brufh and strain it between your hande or fiagers and rub your work over with it to make it lye more even as soon as your brushi is full of white you must wash it over again and even change your water when it is too white vou may sometimes use wet cloath instead of brush your work being smooth and even let it dry and when it is dry rub it over with shave grass or piece of new cloth to make it the kinder how to lay on ground to giid and silver upon after different manner take quarter of pound of fine bole armoniac well chosen fresn and greasy to the touch -steep it in water to make it dissolve then grind it adding thereto the bigness of filberd of crayon and of pea of tal- low which prepare this melt them then throw them into fresh water and therein work them with you hands to fit them for use the size of peai enough for one grinding in grinding you throw little soap-suds among the bole this compound being ground put it into fair water which change from time to time to preserve it when you would use it temper it with warm ’ size and if it prove as strong as what you whitened with put in third of water and mix it with the bole which which you shall make of the thickness of cream then lay it on your work with pencil and go over the whole with it three or four times leaving it each time to dry before you go over it again being finished and dry rub it with soft cloth before you proceed to lay on your gold or silver when vou use this ground for gold you must add little red lead to it how to lay on the gold and silver set your piece slanting and wet part with large pencil dipped in fair water then lay on the gold which must be ready cut apon à leathern cushion whence- you may take it up with cotton the whole being gilt leave it to dry but neither in the wind nor sun and being sufficiently dry burnifh it with dog ’ tooth to know when it is in dne temper pafs the dog' tooth over it in some little places and if it does not rub kindly but peels off it is not dry enongh on the other hand take care that it be not too dry for you will have so much the more trouble in polishing it and after all your pains it will not be so bright as ou may wishi it in great heats three or four hours drying is enough but sometimes it requires à day and night to mats gold make red with red lead little vermillion and the white of an egg well beaten ap grind the whole upon marble and clap it into the deep or hallow pla- ces with fine pencil to matt silver take white of ceruse grind it with water and then temper it with schthyocolla or fisni-glue or else glove size very fine the first is most beautiful you are to lay it with pencil upon the places you would matt to make sbell-gold and shell.-silver pat leaf-gold upon clean marble according to the quantity you would have and grind it with honey just out of the hive or very pure till it be extremely soft under your hand then throw it into glass of fair water and stir it and change the water till it be very clear or fine then pour it into about penny worth of aquafortis and there let it remain two days take out your gold and your aquafortis may serve another time the same may be done with silver when vou would lay on either the one or the other temper it with oné or two drops of very thin gum- water and to give it the smoother face let your wa- ter be soap it is proper also that you should have wash of gall-stone under your gold it sets it off mach you must be very sparing of your gold and silver when you work in miniature excepting the borders round your work because it savours too strongly of the golden image of baal finis
