in water-colours painting in water-colours is an art which has been encouraged by princes eminent for their virtues but particularly patronized by our pre- sent most gracious majesties and no wonder since no representations can show forth nature with more splen- dour and magnificence than painting executed in this manner the materials necessary are gum-colours of swhich we shall treat more

painting in water-colours is flake white some recommend white made of pearl and oyster-shells brought to an impalpable pow¬ der called pearl white which will mix well withi any colour if you use white lead clarisy it with white wine vinegar after the white is settled pour off the vinegar and washi it with watcr thus put the powder into glass of water stir it and presently pour the water off while it is white into another clean glass when it is settled pour off the water and yon will have an excellent white to which add as mucli it has been often noticed that white lead will turn black if mixed with water that comes from iron or clay so that in the space of month or two you may perceive it and it will also change any colour with which it is mixed it is recommended by some to take the powder of egg-shells of the brightest and whitest sort well ground with gum-water to the state of an impalpable powder to which add one twentieth part of white sugar-candy others esteem it most when clarified in spirits of wine and then use it with gum-water it has been found by repeated experience that this egg-shell powder is extremely serviceable as white in water-colours and that this and the oyster-shell powder rectified and well bruised will make an excellent mix- ture with other colours to keep them from changing fine white for water-colours may be made by dif- solving filings of silver or silver leaf in aqua-fortis evaporating the aqua-fortis till it appears like chrystal in the bottom of the glass decant the other part of the aqua fortis and wash the silver four or five times in pure water till it is entirely cleaned from the aqua- fortis drving it for use it must be used with the waters of gum and sugar-candy good white for water-colours proper for miniature- is made thus take pound of the shreddings of glove- leather and steep them in water boil them with- twelve quarts of water till- it wastes to two strain it through linen cloth into well-glazed earthen pan this is called glue or size and proper to use with co¬ lours in candle-light pieces to know if this be strong enough feel if it be stiff and firm under your hand the glue being melted reduce some white chalk to powder and while it is hot add such quantity of chalk as will bring it to the consistency of paste letting it steep for quarter of an hour stir it with brush made of hog ’ bristles in order to make this white brighter add ’ more glue be careful ’ to observe that every layer be dry before you put on another if you work upon wood you must put on dozen but six or seven is sufficient if your paper is thick afterwards dip soft brush in some water draining it with your fingers rub the work with-it in order to make it smoother when- your brushi is full of white you must wash it again and also change the water when it is too white or you may use wet linen rag instead of brushi yellows in some objects there may be seen ffiining like thiat of gold through colours of red blue or green such such as some fort of flies or beetles and the cantha- rides this gold transparency may be very well imi- tated by laying some leaf-gold on the shaded side of che drawing giving à little to the light side to lay oh the gold leaf press it smooth and close with cotton after you have washied it with strong gum-water but care must be taken that in laying on the guin you do not exceed the limits through which you would have the gold appear in this case the goldis only to shine through the transparent colour which is to be laid over it as leaf-gold will not receive water-colours regularly iit is necessary to be provided with water of ox-gall and with this hiquor to stroke over the gold-leaf by which it will receive any colour you are desirous of laying over it and will also retain it in june and july there may be found upon rose- ttrees kind of beetle of gold and green colour which may prove extremely serviceable in this kind of painting but in ufing your gold it will be best te polish it in this manner in some manuscripts there may be seen gold letters which séem to rise above the surface of the paper the composition which raises them is made of ver- milion and the white of an egg beat to the consist- ence of an oil and fixed to the paper with gum-arabic on this figurative letter wash some strong gum-water with camel ’ hair pencil lay on the gold-leaf close with some cotton and when dry rub it again with icotton and burnish it with dog ’ tooth and it will appear as if it was really cast in gold there is also another way of working in gold which is performed by shell-gold but then it must be pure and not that brought from germany which turns green in few days cover the shady parts with vermilion before before yon use ihis gold and when you have rectified it with spirits of wine lay it on when dry burnish it as before directed in laying on this gold it is best to leave the lights without it as it will appear to much greater advan- tage than if all the object was covered but providing the whole performance should chance to be covered the best way of setting it off is to trace over the shady parts with gall-stone or the yellow made of french berries sof which we shall treat hereafter heightened with minium having treated thus much upon gold we shall now speak of yellows in general gambodge is beyond doubt one of the mellowest colours nature has pro- duced it is of so mild temperature that when it is touched with any fluid it instantly-dissolves so that consequently it wants neither gumming nor grinding it is productive of à variéty of the most agréeable and pleafant yellow tints that fancy or art could ever im- agine it will generally shade itself though you will sometimes find in the description of flowers it requires help gall-stone is very rich deep yellow tending to- wards brown exceeding useful in many cases needs but little gumming or grinding works free but will not shade itself mr. boyle says if you cut the roots of berberries and put them into strong lixivium made of pearl- ashies and water from them will proceed very agree- able yellow this experiment has often been made and as often attended with success he also gives an account of another sine transparent yellow by boiling the root of mulberry-tree well cleansed in the foregoing lixivium yellow yellow-ochre makes very good pale yellow and being ground with gum-water will prove extremely useful another very useful yellow is made by infusing the plant celandine in clear water gently pressing it add- ing to the liquor some alum-water letting it boil the virtues of the yellow extracted from french berries is so well known that we need not discourse upon it but only give the directions for preparing it in quart of the preceding lixivium boil two ounces of french berries till the liquor is of fine yello strain it from the yellow berries and when cold it is fit for use to the berries put pint of the same ixi- vium and boil it till the liquor is as strong as gall-stones with which you may shade any-yellous this you may boil till it comes to brown ald will with the addition of alittle ox-gall serve to fhade the gold leaf you may likewise make yellow by infusing saffron in pure water when this is steeped in rectified spirits of wine there is nothing higher but it is very apt to fly unless it is high guinmed good yellow for the illumination of prints may be extracted from the roots of ginger which makes good green when mixed with transparent verdigrise those yellows called english and dutch pinks are made with french berries ground to fine powder and then boiled king ’ yellow fine body colour much used in heightening the ochre for gold lace orange colour this colour is made of mixture of vermilion and gambodge the latter most predominant in which you are presented with pleasant and serviceable colour in painting painting lilies and all other orange colour flowers orpiment is likewise pleasing orange reds red lead or minium is ftrong heavy colour mr. boyle has given us the following directions for prepar- ang it put four ounces in glass to quart of rain water and when it has been thoroughly stirred pour off the water and by frequent repetition of this there will remain at the bottom of the glafs beautiful red when dry which is to be used with gum water when the colour has been thus prepared you must nof expect above twenty grains to remain out of four ounces carmine affords the brightest and most perfect crim- fon and it the most beautiful of all reds for with this colour and lake you may make the shades as strong as you please this colour should never be purchased but by day light for if it is not good it will but spoil your work lake is fine transparent colour not much inferior to carmine but in painting with carmine on that part of the print on which the light is supposed to strike lay on the first tint as light as possible working it stronger as it grows darker and touch it in the darker parts with lake lake may be bought at most colour fhops ready pre- pared for water colours but if you are desirous of making it yourself it is necessary to adhere to the fol¬ lowing directions having prepared lixivium made with the afhes of vine twigs to three pints of it add pound of the best ground brasil wood boil it till half the lixivium is evaporated strain it off boil it again with the addi¬ tion tion of four ounces of fresh brasil wood two ounces of cochineal half an ounce of terra marita and pint of fair water let it evaporate as before add half an ounce of burnt alum reduced to an impalpable powder quarter of drachm of arsenick dissolve them in it by to stirring it with stick when settled strain it off give tnis body reduce two cuttle-fisn bones to powder and putting it in let it dry leisurely grind it mn quantity of fair water in which you may let it steep strain it through cloth and making it into few cakes fet it by for use after drying it on piece of marble if you would have this lake redder add some of the juice of lemon and to make it deeper add oil of tartar another lake boil the shreds of superfine scarlet cloth in lie made of the afhies of burnt tartar when fufficiently boiled add some cochineal powdered mas- tich and roche-allum boil this again while it is quite hot strain it through bag several times the first time the bag must be strained from top to bottom and the remaining grofs matter being taken out let the bag be well washed after this strain the liquor- through the bag again and you will find paste re- maining on the sides which divide into small cakes and set by for use another lake steep four ounces of the best brafik wood in pint and half of the finest distilled vinegar for three weeks at least though the longer it remains the better it is seeth the whole in balneum mariae till it boils up three or fous times let it settle for à day or two put it to an ounce of powdered alum and into clean pan with the liquor let it remain for twenty-four hours heat the composition and stir it till it is cold when it has stood about twelve hours strain it and add two cuttle-fish bones prepared as before liquid colonr of very good crimson may be made as follows in twelve ounces of pale stale beer boil one ounce of ground brasil wood till the colour is as strong as you desire strain it through linen cloth and bottle it up for use if you want to bring this colour to body take some dried ox-blood reduced to pow- der and mix it with the colour we have the following directions from mr. boyle for extracting sine crimson from the berry-bearing spinach which being pressed affords very agreeable juice to which add fourth part of alum boil it and when cold it is fit for use or you may extract very beautiful red from the red beet-root baked with little strong vinegar and alum when cold it is fit for use another way to make crimson put twenty or more grains of bruised cochineal into gallipot with as many drops of the lie of tartar as will make it give forth its colour add to this mixture about half spoon¬ ful of water or more and you will have very agree- able purple reducing some alum to very fine powder put it to the purple liquor and you will have as beauti- ful crimson strain it through fine cloth use it as soon as possible for though this is colour which if soon used looks extremely well yet by long standing is subject to decay indian lake is far superior to any other of the kind for the deep shades of reds of all kinds and works as free as gambodge the best is brought from china in pots and has the appearance of raspberry jam but very bitter to the taste it requires no gum purples take eight ounces of logwood pint of rain-water and an ounce of alum infuse it well over slow fire in well à well-glazed pan or pipkin for about twenty-four hours add quarter of an ounce of gum-arabic let it stand for weck strain it through piece of sine cloth keep it close or it will mould or you may make à redder purple by adding to one ounce of the above sour ounces of brasil wood and pint of stale beer boiling it till the liquor is as strong as you defirc it may be made darker by add- ing more logwood the richest purple is made by blending carmine and prussian bluc or indigo to what shude you please blues uitramarine is the best and brightest blue prepare it by heating six ounces of the lapis lazuli till it is red cool it in strong vinegar grind it with stone and muller to an impalpable powder then make composition of bees-wax resin linseed oil and tur- pentine of each three ounces incorporate the whole together over slow fire till it is near boiling pour them into pan well glazed this is called the paste of ultramarine the lapis lazuli being prepared add to it an equal quantity of the pastil or paste mix them together thoroughly and let them remain twelve hours to extract the ultramarine from the paste pour clear water upon it pressing the paste with your hands the ultramarine will come out for its reception place glass tumbler under your hand let it settle in this water till the ultramarine sinks to the bottoin if the colour seems foul cleanse it thus dissolve some tartar in water add as much of it to the ultra- marine as will cover it let it stand twelve hours washi it in warm water and you will have your co- lour well clarified and perfectly clean let vour iil- tramarine be of high colour and well ground next to to ultramarine in beauty is prussian blue when used in oil though it will not stand so long its not having the body of ultramarine the prussian blue does not grind kindly with water on account of its oily sub- stance blue bice is colour of very good body and flows very agreeably in the pencil wasn it according to the rules laid dovn for ultramarine blue verditure is very bright pleasant blue of good body and works very well when ground with gum-water it is little inclinable to and makes very good green when ground with gambodge or french berries this blue is mostly used for à fky or garment saunders blue is extremely serviceable in the shading of ultramarine where no verv dark shades appear when they do you may add little indigo to it litmose is very agreeable blue to prepare it take quart of fmall beer wort in which boil two ounces of litmose till the colour is as strong as you require pour the liquor into glazed pipkin and it will soon congeal indigo is the darkest blue is foft free colour and- runs very warm in the pencil it requires to be well washed and ground and may be made darker or lighter by the addition of more or less gum-water care is- required in the using this colour for as we before hinted its running fo free may be means of deceiv¬ ing the student and prove too dark for the completion of his desires mr. boyle has given us the following directions for making very fine colour of the blue leaves of rue by pressing bruising and infusing both leaves juice juice in pure water for fortnight washing them every day incorporating them and the water till they be- come pulp letting them dry gradually these will produce an excellent blue for shading which runs free in the pencil put into it the powder of gum-arabic which will be means of making it keep add of the gum as much as you would have it more or less stiff in working sine transparent blue from the preceding author equal to tint of ultramarine -- the flower from which this blue is extracted is the cyanus or blue cornbottle which is possessed of two blues the outer leaves being light and inner dark the latter is held in preference pick both from the buttons and cases in which they grow the same day they were gathered having prepared quantity of the middle leaves press out as much juice as possible with the addition of little alum you will be possessed of fine dur- able transparent blue little inferior to ultramarine the procuring of the flowers and the pressure of the juice should be done with all possible expedition lest the flawers should lose their perfection it has been thought by some if the leaves of these flowers were cured as those of saffron there would proceed from them much greater quantity of colour from which might be pressed more tincture than when fresh from the hield in curing of which it would appear that each time the cake was turned the slowers would be darker till they became dark blue great care is required during this operation that the sire be kept very constant and gentle that the flowers may not be scorched which will be an incontestable way of bringing the flowers to perfection theresore therefore to put this operation in execution akiln must be procured as for curing faffron the top of which is to be covered with hair cloth upon this lay several sheets of paper afterwards parcel of tle inner leaves of the flower two or three inches thick pressing them close and sprinkling them with gum¬ water after which small charcoal fire must be made in the kiln so as to communicate heat to the top cover the cake with few sheets of paper and board with small weight upon it after à few minutes the cake is to be turned when it is placed take off the upper papers sprinkle the cake again with gum-water lay on the board weight as before sor few mi- nutes and so repeat the turning and sprinkling several times till the cake is united and of the thicknefs of cake of saffron blacks the proper blacks for water-colours are as follow ivory black which is prepared in the following man¬ ner let the ivory black be thoroughly ground and there will naturally proceed from it liquor of an oily substance mix as much of it as will make it work freely in the pencil it has fine gloss and is extremely serviceable in painting of shining objects there is another very agreeable and useful black called keating ’ black and may be had at most co- lour-shops ready prepared indian ink is very good black and of great ser- vice as it may be laid on to any shade and will always shade itself on which account it is often used for drawings greens greens sap green is colofr extremely serviceable and the best green for water colours our age affords being of gummy substance and diluting easily in water it produces an endless variety of tints and has the ad- vantage of shading itself in the purchasing this colour remember to observe that it looks very black and bright sca or artificial green is made by mixing indigo and sap green which may be made darker or lighter by adding more or less indigo it is very serviceable colour easily worked and productive of many tints this colour as well as sap green shades itself the indigo must be well ground before you mix it green is made with indigo and gambodge weli ground together extremely useful in painting of trees grafs vegetables with the addition of sap-green it is very serviceable in flowers and shading of garments transparent green is made by mixing verdigrise and yellow to various tints by leaving either pre- dominant browns burnt and unburnt terra di sienna the warmest brown for front grounds dead leaves works very free and is of general use bistre is good and serviceable colour the best fort is very bright and close as it is colour difficult to work of itself mix little spanish licorice with it that will mellow and taken off its harssiness it must be well ground and the higher it is gummed the better for use spanish licarice is allowed by the best masters to be productive of great variety of brown tints of very agreeable agreeable colour it will not shade itself but works as free as any gum colours by diluting it in fair water brown mixture is made by incorporating sap green and carmine which is of an extraordinary soft nature it is colour extremely serviceable as you will find hereafter in description of painting flowers in water colours another by blending vermilion and bistre thorough- ly the bistre must be extremely well ground before you incorporate it with the

best and clearest glue dwith one pint of pure water and half an ounce of the finest roche alum till dissolved this is very serviceable liquor with which you may temper those colours intended for sky as it will preveut them from cracking to make gum water dissolve an ounce of the best white gum arabic and half an ounce of double refined sugar in quart of spring water strain it through piece of mussin then bottle it off for use keeping it free from dust another method take the whitest sort of gum arabic bruise and tie it in piece of woollen cloth steep it in spring water till dissolved if too stiff which is known by the shiining of the colours add more water if too weak more gum with this water you may temper most of your colours using such quantity of it that the colours when dry being touched will not come off to make size for candle light pieces see page the flies from your work having prepared your gum water according to either of the preceding directions add little coloquinteda which if your performance should be exposed will keep it from being damaged by the flies to prepare alum water take four ounces of roche alum and pint of pure spring water boil it till the alum is thoroughly dissolv- ed silter it through blotting paper and it is fit for use before you lay on the colours take fome of this water hot and with sponge wet the back of the paper which if it is not good must be wetted three or four times this will not only prevent the sinking of the colours but will also keep them from fading and give an additional beasty and lustre remember that the paper must be dried each time before you wet it again to make lime water put some unslaked lime in well glazed pan cover it with pure water one inch above the lime let it re- main so for one day then strain off the water and keep it for use by the means of this water you may change sap green into blue tomake alixiviumof pearl ashes steep half an ounce of pearl ashies in clear water for one day strain off the water as clean as possible this infusion will prove extremely serviceable in many co- lours particularly brasil wood to which it will give an additional beauty and lustre to recover decayed colours take douhle-distilled rosemary water or pure essence of rosemary and with few drops temper your colours which which however dead and faded will recover their pri- mitive brilliancy this essence will prevent the bubbles which are troublesome in grinding white and umber to prepare liquid gold for vellum-painting fans having procured some of the finest leaf gold grind it with strong gum water adding more gum water as you see requisite when thoroughly ground temper it with small quantity of mercury sublimate binding it in the shell with little dissolved gum spread it equally over the shell and use it with fair water only liquid silver for the same use the manner of making this is the same as that of liquid gold only remembering to temper it with the glaire of eggs and not water to make the glaire of eggs beat the whites with spoon till they rise in foam let them stand twelve hours and it will be good glaire to recover liquid silver that has contracted rust if your silver becomes rusty cover that part of the performance with the juice of garlick which will recover it effectually to make single ground to lat silver or gold upon take the new shreds of parchment they being pre- ferable to glove leather boil them in quart of spring water till consumed to pint strain the size from the shreds and put it into well-glazed pan use it before it is cold be careful when you lay on your silver or- gold that your size is not too moist nor too dry for in either case you will be in danger of impairing your performancc to take the impression of the wings of butterfly in all their colours kill it without spoiling cut off the body close to the wings which contrive to spread in flying position then take piece of white paper wash part of it with thick gum-water when dry lay it on smooth board with the wings on the gum-water lay another paper over that press both very hard let them remain under pressure for an hour afterwards take off the wings of the butterfly and you will find perfect impression of them with all their various colours remaining on the paper draw between the wings of the impression the body of the butterfly and colour it after life to take the impression of leaf of any tree gently rub the leaf on the backside with piece of ivory or such like substance so as to bruise the veins little wet the same side gently with linseed-oil and press it hard upon piece of white paper and you will have the perfect figure of the leaf with every vein justly expressed then colour it and it will appear correct and beautiful imitation of nature of of painting on glass painting on glafs is an art which has been esteemed by the generality of mankind an amuse- ment attended with many difficulties yet nothing can afford moré splendid and magnificent representation of nature than painting well executed in this man¬ ner there being no outlines or shading required those in the print answering that end mezzotinto prints are generally used for this pur- pose the shades and lines not being so harsh and abrupt as those of engraving as they are-blénded into each other and have the appearance of drawing in indian ink having procured such mezzotinto prints as you in- tend to paint cut off thè margins and get piece of the best crown glass the size of the print free from knots and scratches clean it well with whiting lay on one side some venice turpentine with hog ’ hair brushi as thin and smooth as possible lay the print flat in water and let it remain on the surface till it sinks take it carefully out with its face downwards and dab it between some papers till no water appears yet so as the print remains damp afterwards lay the damp print on its back upon ffat table hold the glass over it without touching the turpentine till it is exactly even with the print then letting the glass fall gently on it carefully pressit down with your fingers in different parts so that the turpen- tine may stick to the print then taking it up hold the glafs towards you pressing the print from the cen- tre towards the edges till no blisters remain next wet the back of your print with sponge till the paper will rub off with your fingers rub it gently and the white paper will come off leaving very plain impression on the glass when dry wet it all over with camel ’ hair pencil dipt in turpentine oil and it will be perfectly transparent and fit for painting colours for painting on glass he colours fit for painting on glass are ground in oil and tied up in small bladders which are to be had at the colour shops

want to get the colour out of and press out no more upon your pallet than you intend for immediate use as the colours are apt to dry and skin over then laying sheet of white paper on the table set the glass rather sloping against two small sticks fixed perpendicular about twelve inches afunder which will be à sufficient support and the outlines and tints will appear on the glafs hold your pallet on your left hand and proceed to decorate as follows of working the colours the lights and shades are dispersed on the picture be careful in disposing of the colours accordingly lay on the light colours on the lightest parts of the print and the darker over the shaded the brighter colours being laid on properly it is not of any material consequence if the darker ones should by accident run over them for the upper colour can not be seen through that which was laid on first for instance greens greens first lay on some verdigrise mix that and dutch pink for the next this may be made darker or

dip piece of bladder in warm water to mollify and make it more pliable this done immediately tie up the colour in it and it will be fit for use when required but though you take all the care possible when the colours are exposed to the air and used in small quan¬ tities there will be thick hard skin over them in very short time which though it may be taken off with pallet knife will occasion great decrease of colour after the fkin is taken off the remainder will in all probability prove too thick for use without drop or two of nut-oil which must be well tempered- with the pallet-knife once more let us caution the artist to keep his brushes to their separate colours for the mixing of them is attended with many ill consequences and will greatly endanger the whole of his performance of painting

is dry set it on an easel which vou may have at the colour shops and proceed as follows with charcoal sketch your rough draught and with black white or red chalk correct your faults hav- ing thus outlined your object compleatly the crayons may be rubbed in but care is required concerning the proper colours then soften or blend them together with your singer or fitch when you prepare the crayons for use remember to cut the points from the bottom upwards and take care they are not made too sharp the red ochre charcoal and white chalk excepted as it is difficult to get crayons that are really good we think it no way superfluous to give the student the method of preparing them directions directions for making crayons whites no other is required than the best and softest french or italian white chalk cut into pieces about two inches long and quarter of an inch in thickness with your penknife round off the corners and point them as before directed of these it will be expedient that the artist should have great number as they are of continual use and must be kept separate from the rest tor they will other- wise be much discoloured yellows as yellows are next to be treated of we shall divide them into seven different shades first take flour of brimstone and grounds of starch with the pallet knife incorporate them upon polished marble it will make an agreeable straw colour bring it to the consistency of paste with milk or pale ale wort with the pallet knife spread it on apiece of smooth cloth till it is in thicknessabout one third of an inch let it remain so till half dry with sharp knife reduce it into pieces about two inches long and one third of an inch wide roll it between your hands or two pieces of board till round as the stem of tobacco pipe and not much thicker point it as directed for the chalk or if most convenient use ground chalk instead of the grounds of starch as that will work near the same effect second yellow ochre well ground upon stone with muller in fair water dry and beat it by mixing fuch quantity of ground chalk or grounds of starch as will render it à little darker than the preceding mixing with it as much milk as will make it pafte forming it into crayons as before little sugar candy may be dissolved in the milk- third grind yellow ochre and water when dry beat it well mix it with very little ground chalk to be darker than the former add to it pale ale wort or size make it into crayons as before for the method of preparing the size we refer the reader to those useful receipts published in the directions for painting in water colours page grind english pink with water as the for- mer when dry beat it in the same manner mix it with little of the grounds of the best white chalk that it may be darker than the former colour incorporate with it as much pale ale wort as will bring it to paste prepare and reduce it into crayons as before directed fifth mix english pink with pale ale wort after being ground with pure spring water reduce it to crayons according to the aforementioned directions sixth dutch pink prepared as the former seventh orpiment mixed with fittle ground chalk or grounds of starch well incorporated and brought to the consistency of paste with pale ale wort in which must be dissolved some gum dragon then rollit in crayons according to the first direction orpiment is poisonous grange orange colours first grind orpiment and make it into crayons from the foregoing directions second grind red lead with pure water very fine when dry beat it with ground orpiment mix small quantity of red lead that is so much as will make it shade darker than the preceding dissolve gum dragon in milk or ale wort and with it temper your colours roll it into crayons as before third grind english pink with pure water mix ât with as much vermilion as will make it agreeable to your design boil ale wort till it becomes glutinous with which bring your colour to paste then cut it in lengths roll it as before fourth prepare english pink and red lead as be- fore mix as much of them together as will make it shade darker than the former mix these with ale wort prepared as above and so into crayons fifth mix as much dutch pink finely ground with red lead as will bring it to the shade required and proceed as before be careful in the compounding these colours to make as many shades as possible reds first grind red lead very fine with pure water when dry beat it as sine as possible heighten it with white chalk finely ground dissolve some gum dragon in ale wort make your composition into paste cut and roll it it into crayons of this composition you may make different shades by adding more or less white second the best red lead ground proceed as before directed third prepare red ochre in the same manner as white chalk fourth fine white chalk or white lead well pul¬ verized with it mix some vermilion ground to the state pf an impalpable powder divide them into three or four shades make each of them into paste with ale wort boiled cut and roll them as before fifth grind vermilion very fine with stone and muller mix it with pale ale wort as before directed roll it into crayons sixth lake of the best sort well ground with water when dry beat it to an impalpable powder divide it in three or four separate parcels add more or less white to each as will give them different shades work each parcel into paste with ale wort afterwards into crayons seventh reduce pure lake to as fine powder as possible with clear water after it is dry reduce to as fine powder as before mix it with milk or ale wort and bring it into crayons according to the first directions eighth indian lake prepare it as the former this alone will be very strong colour but make three différent shades at leaft by the addition of more or less white ninth cut rose pink into the shape of crayons they will be fit for use without any farther prepara- tion carmine will come very expensive as shiil- lings-worth will make but very small crayon blues blues first blue bice well ground with pure water when dry reduce it to powder again adding to it white chalk finely powdered divide it into parcels put to each more or lefs chalk fo as to produce vari- ous shades bring these to the consistency of paste with ale wort mixed with litile size made ac- cording to the former directions proceed with mak- ing them into crayons second blue bice alone finely ground and pre- pared as the preceding third grind verditure with water let it dry after wliich beat it into powder so fine as that no lumps can be seen divide it into four or five parcels to all of which except one add such different pro- portions of white chalk as will make them fhades for each other make these into paste with pale ale wort wherein gum dragon has been dissolved and that blue with which no white has been mixed make into paste with pale ale wort and little size into crayons as before fourth prussian blue be very careful that it is thoroughly ground make it into paste with pale ale wort boiled and thickened with size so into cravons in pursuance of the first directions to make lighter shades prussian blue after you have groind it well by itself and dried it divide it into two or three parcels to each of which add white chalk in proportion as you would have the shades lighter or darker make these into paste with ale wort boiled into crayons as the former fifth rock indigo well ground in pure water dry it reduce it to very fine powder divide it into several parcels to which add white chalk in diffe- rent rent proportions mix these with pale ale wort boiled have at least four shades of them for the darkest use indigo made into paste as the rest and into crayons according to the first directions purples first rose pink grind it as fine as possible when dry powder it mix it well with little saunders blue till it appears of the colour you desire then bring it to paste proceed as before second lake finely ground and washed add to it as much blue bice as will make it of an agreeable reddisn purple make this of two or three different degrees each lighter than the other and into the lighter parts put white chalk or grounds of the best white starch make them into paste with ale wort boiled and mixed with size and then into crayons as before third grind lake with pure water add as much prussian blue to it as will make it of the purple you desire mix these well together in several parcels making some more inclining to blue others to red to the faintest add as much white chalk as you see ne- cessary make the separate parcels into paste with ale wort boiled till it becomes glutinous then into crayons in the same manner as before blacks first the black which is generally used for cray- ons is charcoal cut into pieces about two inches long and quarter of an inch wide the softest and best are those made of willows have of these at least one dozen because the contrasts black and white are most wanted second grind ivory black as fine as possible witli pure water adding to it in the grinding small quan¬ tity of indigo which will very much enliven the black and relieve it from that deadness which attends it when used by itself make it into paste with boiled ale wort inbo crayons as before browns first fullers earth of the best and purest sort grind it well with water add to it some ground chalk in different quantities that you may have three or four different shades mix each of these up with pale àle wort boil it till it becomes glutinous and roll it into crayons second spanish brown ground well with water add in the grinding some fullers earth which will very much enlighten it the spanish brown being of itself very dark colour when dry beat it into powder again divide it into four different parcels to three of which put grounds of starch in different degrees so that you mav preserve several shades of colour mix each of these separately into paste with little size of isinglass or pale ale wort boiled or thick water-gruel wherein gum-dragon has been dissolved make it into crayons according to former directions third indian ink and spanish brown well ground together mix them with ale wort till they are as stiff as paste of this colour you may make different fhiades by adding more or less white greens first distilled verdigrise well ground with strong vinegar wash it well with water as follows put the verdigrise into water let it remain there about mi- nute fiute pour the water off into cup let it settle then pour that from it washi it again in the same manner when dry make it into crayons of different shades with ground white chalk second boil the best verdigrise with sharp vine- gar while boiling add to it little powdered tartar which being of so sharp nature will soon dissolve the verdigrise then you will have à liquor of very fine colour somewhat inclinable to blue set the liquor in siall galilpots exposed to the air which will soon be congealed and become hard mix it with as much-ale wort as will bring it to pafte and crayons as befoce directed third verdigrise prepared after the last manner reduce and divide it'into several parcels add prussian blue in different proportions as you would have them lighter or darker to the lightest parts add little white chalk or little straw colour to variegate the shades as much as possible mix all these with pale ale wort boiled as before directed fourth grind blue bice very fine in the grinding add to it some of the best dutch pink divide it into several parts make different shades with white chalk bring them to paste with ale wort boiled then into crayons fifth grind rock indigo very fine with pure water dry it reduce it to powder divide it into four parcels at least add to some dutch pink to others dutch pink and brimstone for the lightest flour of brimstone only after you have made as many shades as you desire bring them into paste with pale ale wort mixed with size made according to that receipt prescribed in the directions for painting in water- colours page cut them into lengths roll them into crayons as at first directed sixth sixth grind rock indigo with water divide it into parcels more or less as you think proper add dutch pink in such different quantities as will produce several shades after these are well incorporated make them into paste with boiled ale wort roll them into crayons according to the former directions the artist will find these crayons far preferable to those generally bought at shops which being frequently tempered so high with gum-water renders them so stiff and obdurate that they will too often rather scratch than give any appearance of colour upon your paper- on the contrary those which we have recommended may be used with all the ease and freedom imaginable and will express the diversity of colours as pleasant and agreeable as can be desired when the student is desirous of making drawing in crayons either from nature or from correct imi- tation of nature he should be careful before he be- gins that he has every colour that is in his original as he can not hére as in painting either in water or oil colours prepare colour at minutes warning which consideration it was that induced us to direct so many shades to be made from each colour the artist in order to keep his colours separate for if they mix it will on account of their softnefs be very prejudicial to them should be prepared with box which contains as many partitions as will keep each shade by itself
