\f0\fs24 \cf0 ceive theirlight as the middle piece has it fronting over the summer-house\ and wall appear the tops of the hind-buildings now the question is what\ subject is proper for visto or bass relief green prospect such as woody country or slower-garden would have no good effect in this green sum-\ mer-house when seen from without where it ought to be viewed because mixture of green with green affords neither variety nor delight sea haven or\ court adorned with statues fountains cascades and such like elegancies would appear exceedingly fine viewed from within for those colours look well\ among the green but seen at its proper distance without they will be found to\ be false and contrary to nature by reason of the tops of the houses which being behind and rising above them discover general stoppage whence it\ follows that nothing is more proper for the middle piece than bass-relief.\ let us now consider what is best for the two side-pieces seen from within the\ one as said receiving its light from the left and the other from the right bass-relief can not in my opmnion be decorous there because the eye must not\ be so closely confined they ought to be vistos as not having the inconvenience\ which attends the middle piece to hinder their naturalness the summer-house\ heing roofed in the light therefore falls more advantageous on these two places than\ the middle one as being without the glare of it wherefore vistos must be best\ there and even the fainter and bluer the better as before intimated an haven\ with shipping court with fountains islands with hills street-view of fine\ buildings temples and galleries together with blue off-scape these are\ very delightful objects and produce -between the greens variety and deco-\ rum now we ought to observe that the two pieces and though they re-\ ceive their light from the place yet if we please may be lighted otherwise because they are without-door prospects having no communication with this\ within-door place as th\'e9 bass-relief has which is confined to it thus much as\ that to side the same observations are proper for the sides and .\ the second exampl\'e9 in plate lil aforesaid exhibits garden with parterres also walled in in the middie is gate of letticed work and on each side shallow letticed seat covered over with greens noted and in the back of\ each seat is circular representation and over them appear the tops of trees as of large orchard marked now let us consider what subjects will be most\ proper for the seat and first the observe the distance whence the work is\ to be seen which is from without on the near-side of the parterres here af\ in the preceding example vistos are not proper and because the place is so\ full of green more green would not look well wherefore half raised bas-re-\ liefs would be best as for the colour we have before prescribed it the sides\ may also be adorned as before in the last example observing what objects rise be-\ hind and above them here on one side are houses and on the other green\ wall.\ behold now third sketch in plate liii discovering walk with trees at the\ end of which stands the painted object her\'e9in you have great liberty and\ may use your pleafure since the design stands free from any obstruction this\ only is to be noted in it that because it is long walk and in nature\ itself\ itself we are oftentimes tired with travelling such an one we have no occasion to\ make it longer by perspective and other views but rather stop the walker by\ sine prospect and invite him to little contemplation and reft that he may\ afterwards the better go forward wher\'e9fore we here suppose beautiful\ imagery fountain-like of white marble placed in grotto or niche arched\ with green and therein painted in full proportion and with all strength cephalus and aurora zephyrus and flora or venus and adonis and such like or you may represent there in rock having several holes discovering the sky udmus killing the dragon or diana with her nymphs or term or faunus accompanied by bacchanals or satyrs with their instruments some of which\ spout water or else you may exhibit sleeping silenus with the nymph egle squeczing mulberries on his face all these are proper subjects for the place and suitable to the occasion.\ you may also paint some terms on boards cut away and place them against .\ green wall on both fides of the niches windows or circular hollows wherein\ may be set busts or casts as you see in the second\ example of fuch colours as\ before mentioned and which appear lovely among the green thefe terms may\ represent bacchanals satyrs gods and goddesses some naked and-others dressed according to the season and place.\ ch ap xii tables or ordonnances of venus and adonis for the\ embellishment of landscapes.\ hat may conceal nothing from the artists but as much as possible\ rouze and enrich their genius have pitched on this subject far the or-\ nament of landscapes and though it be common yet question whether it\ was ever handled in such manner divide it into three ordonnances.\ the firft is venus\'92 making love to him.\ the second his taking leave of hee to go liunting or rather to be killed.\ and the third her finding him dead.\ the fable is this venus was according to the poets very much enamoured\ with the youth adonis notwithstanding his coldness and insensibility and yet he\ refrained not from kissing and caressing her for season which much incensed\ aiars and raised his jealousy and rages as often as he saw the youth in her lap-\ the first ordonnanse.\ the place opens pleafant and agreeable country stored with every thing\ that can delight the eye woods hills valleys rivers and stone-work except\ houses\ houses and temples iset th\'e9 point of sight in the middle of the piece.\ be-\ tween it and the left side on an hillock place the goddess and her spark at-\ tended by the three graces who are to adorn her one of these is twisting wreath\ of flowers another is crowning her with chaplet of them and the third is\ bringing basket of fruit some cupids are toying about her one especially is\ fitting at her feet blowing adonis\'92 horn at whom he smiles when venus with\ her arm about his neck with her hand presses his against her breast or kisses it.\ behind the aforesaid hillock against the off-scape place some thick-leaved\ trees the highest in the middle of the piece and those to the left somewhat\ lower and thinner behind them we discover the remains of colonade rising\ and appearing half behind the hillock and running towards the point of sight.\ on the same side forwards set crofs low wall which the hillock stems.\ against this wall which is but three or three feet and an half in rise place \'e0\ water-god fitting asleep by his vase and encompassed with greens and in the\ corner against the frame of the piece place large willow tree or-one and an\ half and thus half the piece is filled on the right side forwards plant knobby mossy body of tree about six or seven feet high and close behind it large and beautiful one fully leayed somewhat bevond appears an high square\ spedestal whereon stands large and elegant vase these objects are in line\ running towards the point of sight making way between it and the hillock which is wide forwards and diminishing at 'the end of the fore-ground where the\ second begins and runs out into an open field whence to the horizon are seen\ some faint hills.\ let us now come-forward again in the right side corner envy kindles the\ fire of war \'92sh\'e9 is flying with broken stinking pitch-torch in her hand and her\ head beset with twining serpenits secretly fhewiing mars the two lovers and\ now we see the devouring god of war an his bellys with-ione-leg over stone lurking behind the pedestal and staring eamnestly between it and ithe green of\ the trees at the cause of his jealousy nis spear and fhield lie at his feet.\ once saw print of julio romano wherein he-has placed mars in the off-\ scape purfuing adonis sword in hand which think too obscure and far-fetchect.\ the sense may be tolerabl\'e9 yet it is against the fable for ovid dues not men-\ tion that adonis was killed by mars wath sword but by wild boar through\ his instigation.\ in the mean time doubt not but this my fketch and disposition will seem\ strange nevertheless if well executed it will certainly appear sine with the pe-\ destal low wall and- colonade since such things create great decorum and variety\ in landscape.\ the light assign is bright sun-shine-\ my intention her\'e9 is to represent the month of may or the spring when every\ thing is coming forth and blossoming though am very sensible that the green\ of the trees by the diversity of colour is in the summer more painter-like however this must not be like summer besides the island of cyprus is not like\ holland or other cold countries where the greens come up late for otherwise should not introduce \'e0 basket of fruit.\ now now if it be asked because still set on the large pedestal vase and that\ directly against the hillock where venus and adanis are with the graces whether\ this would not throw very large ground-shade over those figures say it would\ not because assign the sun meridian altitude moreover do not set the\ pedestal so near the hillock as to be any obstacle to the sigures the foremost\ tree because it rises so high can also as little prejudice them its ground-shade\ passing by them over the willow in the corner or at least part of it which\ makes the colonade against which it spreads fall back though the trees behind\ the hillock can sufficiently effect the same since make them either dark green or else in shade and the little leafing hanging over the lovers in the light in\ order thus to have below some darkness for setting off the lovers my intention\ being to place that group directly in the sun in onder to have there the principal\ light.\ but here may be reproved on supposition that act counter to my own po-\ sition namely that in sun-shine people do not stand talking without shading\ their eyes which do not deny but let it be considered that the gods are not\ subject to human frailti\'e9s and therefore they can look against the sun and to\ solve the difficulty with respect to adonis who is not god make his upper\ parts in shade receiving agreeable and strong reflexions from venas and the\ graces.\ from whence arises another difficulty namely by what means this ground-\ shade can fall on him only fince they are sitting so close together that venus\'92 arm\ is about his neck and one of his hands presses her breast and therefore she must\ needs take part of the same shad\'e9 to which answer that there are means\ enough by one thing or other to find that shade and as for venus she may be\ so disposed either little backward or forward as to receive light enough.\ now that mars and enzy at the stone may not draw the eye too much from\ the principals by making them in the light bring not much sun into that\ quarter mean that set the foremost whole stem of the tree and great part\ of the hindmost with part of mars in ground-shade occasioned by something\ without the piece and to let that shade run on the fore-ground just to the\ low wall breaking the residue here and there somewhat with bushes and shrubs might also place there priapus-term or other object in order little to fill that\ corner.\ we have before said that neither houses nor temples must enter the compofi-\ tion why not they say some as well as the terme to which answer that the\ fable makes no mention of any such objects and let me afk who should live in\ the houses it is not said that adonis though man had any houshiold or that\ he worshipped in temple.\ this piece may be richly embellished with ten or twelve figures though mars\ and envy are but partly figures some landscape-painters may possibly object\ against so great number for that those well executed would better become\ an history than landscape but the answer is easy the figures are small and\ the landscape large.\ we shall now proceed to the colours and actions of- the figures.\ we\ we represent venus in her linen yet with her upper parts and legs almost\ bare under her on the grafs appears part of light red garment.\ adonis\'92 garment is greenish blue or dark violet.\ the two graces standing next to venus are drest in light-coloured garments of\ changeable stuff and broken colours preserving about that group great mafs\ of light for which reason chuse such colours as do not cause any unseemly\ reflexions in the carnation of venus or adonis her garment who is crowning\ venus with chaplet is rose-colour fecond more forward and with one knee\ bent is in white and has flower in her hand and the third having the fruits and standing on the left side and somewhat higher on the hillock has an aurora\ or straw-coloured garment we need not say much about mars and enzy since\ caesar ripa relates enough touching them nothing is more proper for mars than rusty fillemot or blood-coloured coat and for envy than black one-\ as for the motions of venus and adonis they are fronting in both but their\ feet more or less turned to the light.\ adonis on the right side inclines his upper parts towards venus with his right\ hand on her breast and his right shoulder coming forwards his under parts are\ fronting and his leg extended and his right drawn in as if he were about to\ rise his face fronting inclines little over his shoulder to the child who blows\ the horn contrarily venus resting on her right thigh applies in some mea-\ sure both her knees to his extended leg her face in profile turning towards\ him fronts the sun her breast is also seen fronting she draws back her left el-\ bow in order to press his hand to her breast.\ on due consideration these two figures will be found to have natural and easy\ contrast or opposition in motion since have endeavoured to give myself fuil\ satisfaction touching all the actions exhibited before set the layman.\ but must return again to the ordonnance forgot to place two children be-\ hind the foremost low wall of whom the one is leaning over it and with\ finger on his mouth and head sunk is shewing the other the steeping river-\ god place them there first for decorum\'92 sake and secondly in order to\ break in some measure that long and stiff piece of stone-work the water-god\ is of brownisn yellow hue almost as dark as the said stone-work and for two\ reasons first for the sake of repose and secondly to prevent mafs of light\ there with the children to the detriment of the principal besides further pur-\ pose to adorn the pedestal of the vase with bass-relief representing bacchanal\ or dancing nymphs and though it come in shade yet assign it strong re-\ flexions there ought also to be added one or two dogs afleep of which the one awaking stares back with prick up ears at the sound of the horn.\ have before said that one of the graces should be dressed in white but now cast beautiful blue veil over it as proper to break the strength of the white-\ piece thus executed is sufficient for the production of many others espe-\ cially if we duly consider how many things are observed in it which by few is\ taken notice of viz the quality of each figure its origin or emblematic signifi-\ cation many fictions are painted from the poet\'92 description but few\ people weigh the writer\'92 meaning though attended with an cxplanation which\ however however is only general without the addition of the circumstances though well\ known to the writer as the shapes dresses colours paffions and other remark-\ ables whence we may conclude what must be the case of those men who do not\ make themselves masters of all these things and how easily they may mistake even\ pervert the sense of the writer or poet if the fact lay in the spring they re-\ present it in summer if in winter morning theys exhibit an autumn evening ought the opening to be solitary place or wilderness they will introduce diver-\ sions should any person have red drapery as proper to him it is made blue yellow we grant that the fable may be fepresented plain enough and who the characters are and what they are doing presently conceived but\ the drift of it is wanting.\ it is unnecessary to enlarge on this table or ordonnance further than to observe that mars here signifies vengeance adonis the cvinter and venus the spring which is the reason why these two last can not agree.\ the poets write that there were four who went under the name of venus the\ first was the daughter of calum and the day the second was brought forth of\ the froth of the sea being conceived in mother of pearl and conducted to cyprus\ by the airy zephyrs it was she who bore cupid to mercury the third was the\ daughter of japiter and dione who was wedded to vulcan chief of the cuckolds and the fourth was the syrian called astarte who courted the love of adonis and\ to whom solomon erected altars to pleasure his concubines whence we may\ judge what great disparity there is between these venuses.\ as for the wild boar it implies the night ignorance impiety filthiness lewdness .\ the second ordonnance or sequel of the foregoing story.\ when adonis was now tired with kissing and flattery or to say better when his\ forrowful f\'e2te drew near and the dogs scenting the boar set up cry he deaf\ to venus\'92 intreaties wrested from her embraces and jumped up eager for sport.\ we must previously understand that we are obliged to confine ourselves to two\ principal points namely the general disposition and the light and though on due consideration it may possibly seem to be chosen less advantageous than\ if it were single piece which willingly allow yet as it now serves to match\ another it therefore requires the same light though reversed one might bet-\ ter become it because then should be at greater liberty but even then the\ dispofition would not be different enough from the former.\ we have in the book or ordonnance shewed that when two pieces hang to-\ gether they ought to have certain conformity especially landscapes with small\ figures as if for instance the heavist work be in the one on the right side and the\ visto on the left in the other or matching-piece it must be contrary and yet not-\ withstandingthat necessity or rule which however subsists ifind something which gives\ me greater satisfaction and better expresses the sense as may appear in the sequel.\ place as in the preceding ordonnance the point of sight in the middle of the\ .\ piece and on the right side an eminence ascended by three or four steps fronting\ or parallel with the horizon upon it at the end against the off-scape represent\ an open niche almost square and compass-headed adornedronboth sides with pilas-\ ters supporting small but elegant cornice here and there somewhat broken about\ the niche hang festoons of poppies which are fastened to the crown of the niche and being buttoned up on each side their ends intwined hang down together.\ thro\'92 this niche having seat before it we discover an agreeable view of woods lawns rivers roads this eminence takes up third part of the piece running off steep on the inner side forwards against the steps which are mostly\ in shade by trees without the piece to the corner whereof stands the goddess we\ place her gilt chariot drawn by two pidgeons.\ on the left side betwen the point of sight and the frame of the piece stand\ three or four great and beautiful trees in row runing from the fore-part of the\ piece and by the hillock towards the point of sight in the corner behind the emi-\ nence rises an high and rough rock also running towards the same point making\ between both narrow passage which forwards is over-run with bushes and grass and behind is bare so as to discover through it the off-scape and end of the rock.\ forwards in the rock make large craggy hollow into which the water falls\ with impetuosity thus much mostly as to the fore-ground at the end of it\ runs narrow crossing river from the eminence to the back part of the rock along the side whereof ishew plantation of high trees in order to make the\ off-scapes which is seen through them apear as in valley on the level whereon\ stands adonis set between two trees white marble basis with broken term and its trunk lying near it.\ thus have shewed the general defign which quistion not will appear more\ uncommon and wood-like than the other the third hope to make still more\ wild than this because the subject requires it some may possible think it is to\ be an agreeable and delightful ordonnance but the sequel will shewit to be other-\ wise for in this represent the month of august and the sun somewhat darkened\ and fiery instead of shining brightly the air gloomy and cloudy as if it were go-\ ing to thunder the wind also bloes and every thing is shaking and in motion not one way but as in whirl-wind the dust like vapour rising from the ground\ in some places.\ perhaps you did not expect this fort of management but on due consideration\ of the case it will be found both natural and artful.\ we now proceed to dispose the characters.\ the goddess seeing the evening approach doubled her courtship the cold\ adonis contrarily eager for sport hearing the noise of the dogs hastily arises from\ the eminence now all things are in an hurry venus follows him with intrea-\ ties but in vain fate seizes and pulls him along with her the graces are in con-\ fufion one runs after him another fearful of the goddess\'92 swooning and tum-\ bling down the steps supports her the third sadly shrieking and crying lifts\ up her open hands on high the boys are in contention one is hawling adonis\ away and the other stopping him cupid lies thrown on the ground others run\ with the dogs before tke wild boar appears in the before-menfioned narrow pas-\ sage between the eminence and the river set on by gruel rage with pitch-torch\ now this ordonnance seems to have much more work than\'92the preceding and\ yet if considcred it will be found\'92otherwise and that in the former the figtres\ are only more scattiered besides in hearing things related they always seem mors\ to us than in the picture itself.\ venus exhibit as coming down the steps as also one of ghe graces whe rune\ after adonis isince he is slipt out of the goddess\'92 hands the youth represent\ running juft in the middle of the piece between the eninenee of the trees three\ or four paces beyond the steps whereon the goddefs stands beseeching him in\ tears he is almost half in the ground-shade of the eminence for have said that the sun is setting the children who attend the dogs are entirely shaded by\ the stone-work on the eminence which is so high and large that the bodies of\ the last trees do not escape it venus stands with her right foot on the lowermost\ step and with the left on th\'e9 middlemost on the inner corner stooping her un-\ der parts almost fronting and her upper parts turned siedways towards him pres-\ fing her folded hands with \'92the elbows forwards against her body and sinking\ her head looks from him towards heaven place one of the graces by her side\ as coming down embracing the goddess about the waift with fear and concerns\ and with amazement looking to the left after adonis the other virgin who\ runs after him is now with one knee on the ground with-her left hand shewing\ him the goddess and with her right hand holding skift ofhis coat so that she\ is most seen from behind the third has as is said her hands stretched on high and her face is swelled by the violence of her outeries adonis as in great haste advances his right leg turning his breast to the right to-the light he holds spear\ in his right hand high close to his side which boy is withholding with all his\ strength for which another angrily strikes him with his bow adonis-looks downr\ wards with his face fronting at the virgin who is at his feet pointing with\ his left hand which is fore-shortened at the wood by which anm fate is pulling\ him thither she is flying and has rudder of fhip on her shoulder hertright\ shoulder and right breast come forward her other parts beifg fore-shortened and\ her face turned backwards before him represent cupid also flying and pul-\ ling him towards the wood by the string of the horn which swings by his side.\ this boy is seen quite from behind with his feet flung out and holding his bow\ in his right hand with which he is threatening another who is tumbled down and\ lyes also fore-shortened with his head forwards and\'92feet towards adonis he is all\ in shade except his head and the hand with which he scratches it -his torch lies.\ near him extinguished.\ slappet of venus\'92 red garment comes about her right arm and swings behiad\ over her left leg the chaplet of iflowers falls from her head down her- back-\ fate is dressed in black with \'e0 small\'92slying veil over-it .\ .\ behind the broken term are iseen the arms of mars viz his armour helmet shield sword and spear lying oa the ground in shade now although mars does\ not appear in his own shape but in that tof the boar in which he was metamor-\ phased yet we need not wonder at it bedause we must not suppose that as he was\ god he entered into it stoekined and fhoed some may possibly afk whether\ he could not do it in his full habbliments and say he might but then must\ ask again how we should know it the dresses of gods and men have no sen-\ sation either-good or bad they are even of no ocher signification than to\ make the person known for were they subject to the paffions arifing from heat\ or cold thoy would also share the punishments of the body as the head hands do.\ yet it may be very reasonably afked here in case we were to represent tho\ canicrous aglaura metamorphased by mercury into touch-stone whether her gar\ ments should not be quite black \'e0 and answer that nothing but her bodv\ should be so for otherwise my affertions fall to the ground though have said that the dress makes the person known nevertheless shall in this point fur-\ ther explain myself.\ king lyncus approaches the bed of his sleeping guest triptolemus with inten-\ tion to slay him ceres appeared at the very instant and took the weapon from\ the king at the same time transforming him into lynx beast like tyger for violating the laws of hospitality this story would represent thus tho\ king is not there the beast make taking to flight shaking from himi aboug\ the floor the purple garment and crown this think most agreeable to nature\ and probability add to this another instance.\ juno says the poet in wrathful jealousy beat the poor calisto so much that\ she was metam\'f4rphased into fhebear now how is this to be represented in order to know what she was man or woman would represent the frighted\ bear as taking to flight not cloathed but dragging her garment behind her\ along the ground here the bow there the quiver of arrows strap and other\ ornaments-\ yet in what mean manner have seen the king lyncus represented by testo.\ he stands with the dagger in his hand cloathed and crowned having for legs\ the frightful paws of bear.\ thus ihave affirmed that cloaths serve gods and men only for distinction which brings to my remembrance print of poussin confirming what have said.\ it exhibits the elysian fields with the happy souls at rest and youth or eternal\ spring dancing and strewing flowers here we see hyacinthus narcissus crocus adonis ajax and many others in sitting postures as when living whence we\ may easily perceive how difficult it would be to know them without their partir\ cular badges of distinction as the spear horn fountain helmet chaplet of\ roses and how impossible it was poussin so excellent and learned man to\ make sja\'e6 known seeing he there represents him in the same rage or despair to\ to wit stabbing himself as when he was before troy great mistake in my\ opinion with respect to probability should rather have left it out as also the\ chamber-pot or cistern wherein nartissus is viewing himself.\ can hardly believe so strange design to be of poussin himself since ajax is\ plaged in so cruel posture among the happy souls man who being felo de se rather deserved hell why may not sispphus ixion prometheus or tautalus whp\ are doomed tohellish\'92punishments be of their company lt is true that ajax\ acted only against himself on account of the arms of achilles to which he had .\ claim and the others offended the gods one stole the fire froin heaven anothen\ had the impudence to trepan the goddess juno to his lust by an ambush .\ testa has in my opinion in many particulars exhibited the same representa-\ tion better and more intelligible than poussin as being much larger and more\ pleasant and painter-like but yet he runs counter to the probability of that place\ of rest as we may perceive in the two figures of boy and girl where he is\ taking some flowers out of her lap and she in return is ready to scratch out his.\ eyes being an old quarrel revived now in fact neither hatred quarrel or\ jealousy nothing but repose and peace should appear there.\ but methinks hear some say that derogate from the worth of those two- great\ men by thus exposing their mistakes and that it is easier to find faults than to\ make thorough composition which perfectly own nevertheless my intention\ is not in anywise to build reputation on their errors since it will appear throughout this work that am no kinder to my own mistakes than to those of\ others and this with view of shewing artists way for avoiding such common\ defects and of making them more careful to mind probability in all parts.\ here let us make comparison between an architect and painter good\ architect ought first exactly to know what ground is most proper for his pur-\ pose in building temple palace as whether it be firm-or marshy and\ to which quarter he must order his front and then to proceed to- work if painter intend to represent courtship or military exercise offering or any\ thing else he will also look for proper place whereim to lay the subject the\ architect makes plan of his court with all its appertunances of temple with the choir altar and other particulars of fortification with its bas-\ tions ravelines rendezvous painter likewise exhibits the elysian fields or the garden of flora for canesses temple for divine service court with\ the king and his retinue or forest for hunting now if person enter tho\ temple during divine service with- sword in his hand or be stabbing himself\ in the elysian helds among the happy souls in order to give his soul second\ reniove would you not conclude those things to he very improper for such\ places and fitter for troy afk whether the sacred temple and fields are not\ thereby profaned \'e0 and were dogs to be hunted in the palace-court or place of\ rendezvous would it not be ridisulous \'e0 ajax never entered the elysian fields be-\ fore his soul\'92 separation yet here he stabs himself again- has he another soul\ to depart from him let us now proceed to the description division and consideration of the third and last ordonnance.\ the goddess of love perceiving all her endeavours to be fruitless and grow-\ ing impatient for adonis\'92 return took her chariot drawn by two swans and\ drove swiftly towards the wood in order to seek him leaving her graces behind as useless at this juncture as we shall further explain at the end of this ordon-\ nance cupid follows her shrieking the unhappy youth bit by the wild boar\ in his groin lies gasping against lafge oak where at last venus finds him in\ his blood wherefore stepping from her chariot like frantic sne bewails\ hi abhorring her godhead and eursing the-cruel tyranny which prescribes law\ to heaven and earth in the mean time adonis expires and his waving soul is\ taken by mereury and carried to the elysian fields this fable represent thus.\ adonis is lying on his left side fore-shortened with his neck against the trunk\ of large oak and his right breast and shoulder upwards his left arm extend-\ ed and the right close to his body holding the spear which is partly un-\ der him his head hangs almost on his left arm little foreright with the right\ check upwards his feet are turned towards the left corner of the piece for-\ wards his left knee resting on fmall rising or stone is half drawn up an\ hunting-horn lies at his feet the dogs at his head on the left side howl and\ yelp \'e9upid on his right side stoops down and looks at venus shrieking at\ the same time opening adonis\'92 garment in order to shew the bloody wound to\ his-mother who affrighted starts-back and raises her hands towards heaven.\ cupid\'92 back is by the goddess partly in the ground-shade his breast is fore-\ shortened his feet close and knees somewhat bent holding torch in his right\ hand veuus as hag been said raises her hands on high putting out her right\ leg and drawing back her left foot on cloud which behind her runs up to the right under the chariot her upper parts incline over the said left foot her\ chin is\'92sunk iato her breast and thus she beholds the wound her breast is-\ fore-shortened and her right hip is fronting behind the aforesaid oak against\ which adonis is lying the chariot is seen in profile on some waving clouds alike\ with the horizon which about venus descend gradually lighter and lighter to ,\ underneath her foot the chariot though gilt yet kept dark by cloud is\ elegaatly wrought with children festoons and foliage behind on top is large\ star and the chariot partly hid by the body of the oak forwards between the\ middle and the left corner stands -stone about threc feet square with the\ broken trunk of term the residue whereof as the head and part of the body lie on the ground among the-bushies and shrubs this stone stands somewhat\ obliquely with the left corner towards the left side of the piece close to which.\ side rises an high tree and little further another quite overgrown five or six\ feet high behind the stone among the shrubs thistles and thorns the boar attempting to fly lies wounded in blood and dirt on its fore-legs with its mouth-\ wide open on the second ground on the right side goes atropos with her\ sciffors in her hand and distaff on her fhoulder being almost ta the middle hid.\ behind the ground- and in shade except her head and part of one shoulder.\ the principal view is on the left side of the point of sight.. little above it-\ slies mercury-with the soul of the youth in order to carry-it to the ehsian fields.\ they are both seen fore-shortened with their right sides fronting the youth is\ quite naked having his arm-cross his breast his legs close and his

to say touching fine fable and the myfterious sense of some circumstances find myseff\ nbliged by the-satisfaction which several of the best artifts have found therein to\ gratify zheir defires and to give- an handle for axercife in fketching such\ another.\ have chofen for this purpose the fable ofdryope and will adapt it as much\ as possible to the ornament of landscapes making it without-door prospect.\ the story according to ovid is this dryope insensible of the sorrowful\ difitster that was to befall her on certam time took awalk by \'e0 lake encompaffed\ with-myrtles with intent to make the nymphs of the place presents of garlands\ tif flowers stre took with-her her little son amphisus not yearold accompanied\ by her sister jole with bafket of flowens anrd wreathed garlagds near the lake\ stood tree zatled lotos bearingred bloffoms of which she trafhily broke twig\ zo pleafigre her child but perceiing blood to-issue from it and -that the whole\ tree was thereby violently agitated she was much affrighted and the more when in going thence \'92she felt her feet to fasten into the earth.- for sne was trans-\ formed into tree.\ lexhibit the subject see plate liv in delightful vallev according to the\ testimony of the poet planted with myrtles and encompassed by abrook inthe\ middle of the piece place as the principal tthe tree lotos full of red blossoms\ and thickty leaved from this tree dryope broke off the sprig make it to.\ shake and move so violently that the trunk of it by that means-become distorted\ and winding on\'92the left side iplace the raffi dryope of beautiful air and\ black haired having her son amphisus about the middle in her left arm she ad-\ vances with her left fo\'f4t towards the-tveer little drawing back the right her\ upper parts fallhack still more in her right hand lifted up sne holds the bloody\ sprig at which she stares in confusion her left thigh comes forward her up-\ per\ per parts sway to the left her broast isc-ahriost fronting directly against the light her face in profile more or less turns back and her feet are by this time fixed in\ the ground we see the child\'92 hinder parts and its head is set off against her\ breast her sister on theright side of the tree standing over against her re-\ present with light hair and in the iutmost concern wringing her clasped hands\ against her left cheek her head turned to the right hangs over her right shoul-\ der her breaff heaves and her under parts draw quite back her knees are bent her right foot flung out and the left drawn back as if she were fainting away.\ she is about fourteen or fixteen years of age the nymph who supports dryope is placed between her and the tree holding her back with her left hand and with\ her right uncovering the leg and shewing to the sister at whom she looks that\ the foot has already taken root another nymph who is taking the child has\ her left side fronting yet her back parts are mostly visible she is on her knees the left forward the other quite drawn back pushing with her foot against water vessel which at the brink of the water she overturns third on the right\ side comes running quite astonished with lap full of flowers she points with\ her left hand towards the others and looks to the left at her companions fitting\ on the banks of the river which partly runs between the trees towards the point\ of fight the one arises and looks forward with amazement and makes it known\ to the other sitting towards the water who therefore supporting herself on her left\ hand turns her upper parts to the right in order to look back they have\ mostly chaplets either on their heads or lying by them.\ thus much as to the disposition and actions of the moveable by-ornaments which consisting of virgins each is contrasted according to her paffion we now\ proceed to the immoveable ornaments..\ on the left side on rising ground between the the trees place large front-\ ing priapas term without arms or legs mostly in the snade against the off-scape which strongly throws off the foremost group on the right side forwards half\ in the water set square large rough stone whereon lies garment or veil and\ parcel of leaves and flowers in the pannel of this stone is carved fatality in\ bafs relief behind it and between the nymph with the flowers place on the\ ground basket of chaplets.\ as for the season it is laid between summer and winter in the ripening autumn\ and in sine weather for the time of year the light is side one little fronting.\ the sun may be put in or left out as every one pleases because it is not men-\ tioned or insisted on in the fable.\ shall next proceed to describe the further circumstances of this ordonnance since without shewing the light and darkness harmony and colours it is imperfect\ and not fike aature it must be granted that the harmony and shadowing often-\ times shew themselves and that tne light is sufficiently apparent to him who un-\ derstands perspective but whether there may not occur still something beyond the\ common guess and judgment very much question as for the colours they\ must needs be expressed since without it it is impossible to know or penetrate\ mine or any other painter\'92 thoughts.\ therefore\ itfietefore aflign dryope as the principal character ablue sattin garment one\ flappet whereof goes over her right shoulder and comes under her girdle and the\ dther is in her left hand with which sheholds the naked child about the middle when the remainder with an under flap tucked in the girdie under her left breast covers all her other parts down to the feet except the left leg and foot which is\ rooted in the ground her under garment as likewise the open sleeve about her\ left arm is yellowish white with green reflexions her garment next the left\ leg is open the foremost nymph is almost naked having no other covering than\ sine white small scarf about her middle the dresses of dryope and lole are in-\ termixed with gold in order to make difference between them and the nymphs.\ the nymph who is naked\'92from the middle drefs in dark green gown gather-\ ed at the navel and fastened by girdle lole has an airy garment close-sleeved of bright rose colour girt with broad girdle of dark violet embroidered with\ gold and under it flowered coat open below and giving freedom tothe legs stone forward is greyish and the vessel dark red.- the ground next the water is grassy and thus variegate the whole fore ground the nymph who on\ the right side of the second ground comes running has afgreenisn breast garment loose and untied witho\'fbt sleeves and fastened but on one shoulder the left breast\ and legs being bare the other sitting further behind on the edge of the river leave quite naked her companion has small green scarf.. the stone priapus\ is dark gray inclinable to violets\ as for the light think that the major part ought principally to fall on dryope\ and the two nymphs next her and on what else belongs to that group.\ the re-\ sidue may be little and mostly foreign lighted either from behind before or\ sideways yet in such sort as that the cause thereof and the snades as by what\ and from whence may plainly appear gtherwise they will be but loose fancies without foundation.\ some may possibly question whether hereby the light will answer my purpose because assign dryope ablue garment over yellowish white one judging not\ without seeming reason yet without knowing my intention that the contrary\ would look more decorous namely the light over the dark because the great-\ est and strongest mafs of light falling on her middle parts to wit belly and legs the naked child would be more beautifully set off if her breast or upper parts.\ were dark than against the yellowissi white this with respect to the light willingly allow but not as to the colour for designedly made the garment blue\ in order to make the naked nymph beautiful and yer with intention that that\ part might keep strong and broad light for this reason have chosen stuff\ for itaccordingly it being brown that sattin has gloss and almost the same\ force as gold or silver ffuffs the red garment of lole as being beautiful and\ light colour will'be sufficiently yet too much set off against the dark ground but the blue has here on account of the great mafs more power though having\ more light about it for the red is but small spot have as much as possible considered th\'e9 probability ofthis representation and the harmony in the dispofi-\ tion of the eolours assigning each figure its particular and proper emblematic co-\ lour not only in the draperies but also in the nudities giving one fair and ten\'ac\ der another more brownish sxin and so forth each figure-has likewise its par-\ ticular characteristic the head of the water-nymph is adorned with white bell-\ flowers that of the wood-nymph with wild plants and that of her who comes\ running forward with field-flowers if it be wondered that make mention of\ sattin since we rarely hear it was in use among the ancients say the observa-\ tion is just with respect to statuaries but not as to painters because have met\ with several old pictures wherein have seen sattin represented but how long\ that stuff has been known to the world \'92cannot tell nor shall enquire in the\ mean time it must be allowed to be beautiful and elegant stuff as are also the\ changeable silks though in less degree and more proper for young people.\ if any difficulty arise from my introducing into this story priapus-term since\ there\'92 neither god man faunus or satyr in the whole piece nor the least sign\ of any indecent action iwill give him my reason which is that the poet re-\ lating the first cause of the disaster befalling this unhappy woman afcribes it to\ the tree lotos because when woman and priapus could not satisfy his lust with\ her he in revenge transformed her into that tree bearing her name laying curse on those who violated it and still retains that vindictive humour where-\ fore place him here as the first promoter of the accident.\ insist largely on these fables or ordonnances to give handle for further\ inquiries into them for ovid is not full and particular in all his fables and we\ are obliged to fetch \'e0 great deal from ather authors he gives us no right idea of the tree lotos stranger to these countries nor\ mentions what sort of leafing it has or its virtues or whether it be of moist\ or dry nature or where it grows most plentifully wherefore as far as have\ met with them ishall produce the testimonies of some authors about this tree to-\ gether with the emblematic sense and explanations they assign very proper part\ of knowledge for landscape painter whose inclination leads hini to something uncommon and desires to pafs for learned among the curious and knowing.\ have found in general that the leaves are round which at the rising sun-\ open and as he goes down close and at night double wherefore when we in-\ troduce no sun-shine they must be represented doubled or shut.\ as for the misterious sense we must know that the agyptians paid more ho-\ nours to this tree than any others on belief that it was mediator between.\ heavenly and earthly things it is moreover used to represent the sun\'92 rising and\ setting especially with the addition of child sitting on it by which they signified\ the morning vapours which the sun\'92 approach dispels and because it opens\ and shuts its leaves with the sun\'92 rising and setting it is sacred to apollo as tree\ peculiar to him and out of respect shewing its leaves to him only.\ the rough or hairy lotos was also much venerated by the romans who offered\ the vestals locks of hair to it \'ab as they did those of young men to apolle or to\ his son asculapius.\ the gree\'e8s sacrificed their hair in the same manner\'92to the rivers of their country as having certain relation to this tree -which they imagined had such intercourse\ with the gods that they made it their seat and therefore it was planted in\ morasses.\ ialblichus testifies that these trees require much moisture whence the ancients\ inferred the first cause of procreation therefore calling the ocean the father of\ all creatures and observing the round leaves round stem and round fruit they would by this mofl perfect figure intimate the perfection of the highest\ deity especially when child was represented sitting on atree which ovid like-\ wise alludes to in this fable when as mr. pope has rendered it he says now from my branching arms this infant bear let some kind nurse supply mother\'92 care yet to his mother let him oft be led sport inher shades and in her shades be fed -\ we shall now proceed to second table or ordonnance relating to dryope.\ the story is this as soon as andr\'e6mon was advertised of the sorrowful accident\ which had happened to his wife dryope he hasted to the place in company with\ his father but they arrived too late to have any speech with her before the meta-\ morphases rough bark had now seized her body and members insomuch that\ she was only to be known from other trees by her shape and soft voice her\ arms made two branches abounding with leaves besides her head attire cover-\ ed with greens both the father and son hung about her neck and wept and\ with the child at her request kissed her for the last time whereupon she was\ divested of her human shape at once.\ in the former ordonnance have ordered th\'e8 river forwards and in this sideways dryope all but her head transformed into myrtle-tree place al-\ most in the middle of the piece standing upright little to the left of the point\ of sight andr\'e6mon takes her about the neck and kisses her left cheek his aged\ and sorrowful father complains of the sorrowful mishap to nymph standing near\ him with his right hand tearing open dryope\'92 linen in order to shew her the bo-\ dy which beholding she raises her shoulders turning her head away and look-\ ing down another nymph having the little amphisus in her arms lifts him up in\ order to kifs his mother jole place in great lamentation at dryope\'92 feet and step further stands the tree lotos on the second ground onthe right side set\ the term of priapus cross-hung with festoons of flowers and greens tied under the\ navel and before it small smoaking altar with some people offering on the\ left side on the fore-ground place the large square stone half under water with\ nymph leaning on it these are the heads of my design the view is on the\ left side of the point of sight and consists of hills and waters and because re-\ present an evening the air is full of vapours and dark clouds and the trees by\ reason of the wind are in agitation.\ now as this piece is the fellow of the former all things should of right be\ equally full of work but because this ordonnance has the greater variety as ex-\ hibiting some men have been necessitated to depart ltttle from the original\ disposition since what is introduced into the other must needs be seen here as\ we have largely treated in the zist chap of ordonnance wherefore place\ dryope fronting with both her arms lifted up and pretty near each other hef\ head loosely hangs down between them to the left her arms from the elbows\ upwards together with her breast and little of her body retain their first\ forms andr\'e6mon is seen on the left side standing on tip-toe in order to kiss\ her left cheek which she offers him his right arm is about her neck and his\ left on her breast little forward stands the father tottering and near his\ side the nymph to whom he complains at the same time opening dryope\'92 un-\ der-garment only tied on her shoulder with ribbon and turning his head and\ tipper-parts to the left with his face towards heaven the nymphs stands\ close behind him very dejected and sorrowful raising her shoulders and looking\ downwards with her head little sideling off from dryope her left elbow is drawn\ in and her open hand up at her head her breast is bare and in the light her\ under parts are fronting and her right leg flung out andr\'e6mon\'92 garment fall-\ ing from his fhoulder hangs about his heels the nymph who on the right\ side where the ground is somewhat lower is lifting un the child falls back in\ her upper parts with her head hanging forwards she rests on her right leg having'the left lifted up against the tree her back is fronting and turns to the\ light and her under parts have contrary sway the child whose upper parts\ only are seen the rest being hidden by her head stretches out both his arms for-\ wards towards the tree pressing one of his feet against her body jole sitting\ squat between her and the tree leans her left shoulder against it with her head\ coming forward and her hand on her face having cloth in her lap on the\ left fide without the piece at the end of the fore-ground place two nymphs one with her legs in-the water and resting on her right elbow and holding her\ chin and with ghie other hand under her right arm-pit the other sitting with.\ her legs behind the former in the water and resting with her right arm on vase and hef face and right breast fore-right they are both naked and wingedt\ near these stands third holding long staff on the top whereof is pine-\ apple \'92 fhie has about her wild beast\'92 fkin and points with her right hand\ forward in which position her right-side is seen behind her on the aforesaid\ stone lies dryope\'92 garment and on the same side forwards rises large tree incumbered with wild bushes and sprigs.\ the light take as in the former from the right fide little fronting for were it left one it would hot so commodioussy bring the light parts together in\ group and the rather \'92as 'the piece is fellaw of the former.\ reprefent then the \'e9xpiring dryope bare almost to the middle by the drop-\ ping her under garment which as in- the former is yellowish-white her\ face and breast retain their ffeshinefs and colour but her body downwards grows\ darker and browner like wood-colour till at last it is perfectly woody as hap-\ pens also to her arms which to the

beautiful violet he has shoes and wide stockings his cap like the\ .\ turband curling on top lies with his staff at his feet and his hair is grey.\ nymph by his side is half shaded by him that is her whole right side from the\ shoulder dowuwards except her knee which she advances her vestment is\ greenish blue inclining somewhat to dark the nymph with the child has an\ airy blue garment girt about the middle her right shoulder is bare and the\ slappet of her garment ruffled about her legs by means of the wind the virgin\ behind her and between the tree lotos has white garment the priapus-term\ between the trees is by them mostly shaded and off from it passing by the\ point of sight the major part is filled up with small trees which are dark or in\ shade and brightly setting off the foremost group.\ the two naked nymphs on the left side receive little light the air on the\ horizon is full of vapours and melting because do not give here the sun so-\ bright and clear as in fine morning nor so strong as at mid-day but more or\ less vapourish and therefore the whole appears of russet colour the clouds.\ are large thick and heavy.\ the sky might also be properly enriched by exhibiting in it the three parcae or\ fatal sisters since having done their bufinefs they are again ascending in\ such case atropes with the thread and scifsors ought to be foremost next to her\ lachesis with the spindie and behind her clorho with the distaff.\ let us noi exhibit andr\'e6mon and his family\'92 return homc in third table or ordonnance of dryope sec plate lv.\ the late dryope after her fate stands with-the tree lotos at the end of the\ fore-ground little to the right of the point of sight and from her to the\ left side appears bending way like crescent coming forward against\ which the

against the off-fcape especially on the right side from whence to the left side through the hollow of the rock is seen further\ off-scape behind this hill or height appears the beautiful top of andramon\'92.\ house.\ believe it will not seem odd to the knowing that introduce so much high\ ground and water about so small spot of low land because the poet lays the\ fact in lake for which reason and in order naturally to shew it exhibit that\ corner with the way crescent-like as being but part of the lake.\ the question is now whether painter may not take some liberty for deco-\ tum\'92 sake answer he may so far as not to take away the property of the sub-\ ject for what the writer lays down must pafs for law whetefore we may well\ conclude that ovid does not say any thing without reason some may possibly\ think could have made more delightful choice but it may be observed that\ this fact is of contrary nature seek not for pleasure in the midst of sorrow which here is my principal scope as may appear by what follows.\ in the path on the right side represent some bacchanals and satyrs trooping to-\ wards the hills among them one is carrying priapus-term on his shoulder with large vessel in his other hand and followed by tygers and panthers as\ for the transformed dryope let her under garment of the colour before said hang on the tree near which stand three

per to the landscape these things are also of use to history-painters for repre-\ senting richness of matter in poor occurrences wherefore to be copious and\ further instructive shall handle one fable more as also design of my own and then for the conclusion of landscapes make comparison between what is\ painter and un-painter like the latter whereof is by ignorants commonly called\ the contrary.\ \'97\ chap xiv table or ordonnance of erifichton and the emblem\ of satyr punishment both serving for the embellisbment of land-\ scapes.\ vid relates that erifichton avery vile man was by the goddess ceres .\ whom he had highly offended by cutting down an exceeding high oak-tree consecrated to her punished with insatiate hunger insomuch that for want of\ food he was obliged to sell his-own daughter see plate lvi.\ represent this in delightful landscape or without-door prospect the light\ comes from the right side and the point of sight is in the middle on tlie\ left side exhibit stately building with beautiful frontispiece of the dorick\ order ascended by three steps running towards the point of sight beyond the\ steps place an hand-rail four feet in rise running from the house by the point\ of sight in the return of it stands vase on the right side is -river with wooden bridge over it by the water-side appears part of town-wall which the\ water walhes and runs round the residue is an off-scape here and there planted\ with trees next the hand-rail pl\'e2ce the hungry erisichton who with his cap\ in his left hand is tumbling his told money into it with his right hand his\ daughter mestre stands behind him near the steps and the merchant stepping up\ shews her the door with his right hand wherein he has bag half full of\ money money at the fame time holding her with his left by flappet of her garment.\ lean hunger behind between her and her father\'92 right side pushes her forwards.\ with both hands this is the main of the subject.\ the merchant looking proudly and gravely at the daughter is dressed in violet-coloured garment reaching just below the knees it is girt about hia\ middle he has fillet about his head and he is loosely stockined and shoed ac-\ cording to the spartan custom he is seen mostly from behind resting with his\ right foot on the upper step and drawing up the left from off the middle one.\ the daughter stands on her right leg with her left foot just on the lower step .\ little drawn back her under parts are almost fronting more or less from the light she-sways her upper parts to the right wishfully looking at her father whoin she\ is unwilling to ieave with sorrow and tears fhie seems to move the merchant\'92'\ pity and to follow him against her will she has an handkerchief in her right\ hand with which up at the left ear sne seems to wipe her face supporting the.\ elbow of that arm with her other hand her garment is pale yellow with green reffexions and being slovenly gathered under the breast and tied with ribbon hangs in tatters below the calfs of her legs she is bare-footed has beautiful\ mein yet is somewhat thin her hair is light twisted with small blue ribbons.\ erifichton stands quite stooping with bent knees his garment tied about the\ middte with rope is fillemot and reaches behind to the calfs of his legs being\ so open on the side as to discover his bare hip and leg his left shoulder is also\ naked his hair and beard grey and he is lean and swarthy his stick stands against\ the hand-rail as for hunger ovid describes him thus with frightful hair eyes sunk in mnouth and lips livid teeth yellow and slimy and thick skin dis-\ covering the bones and entrails he is seen almost to the middle above the back of\ erisichton the pillars of the frontispiece are grey the house and steps free-stone and the pavement the door is of large blue ftone and from thence down to the\ river the ground is plain in the front of the house are carved two cornua copi\'e6.\ the vase is of reddisn

circumstances indi-\ gency necessaries of life and opportunity indigency seeks relief where it is to\ be had if not in town elsewhere wherefore represent necessity in both father\ and daughter coming for relief to the substantial man\'92 country seat who lives in\ plenty the further circumstances as the bridge town and horns of plenty explain themselves.\ ido not place lean hunger near erisichton contrary to what ihave formerly said namely that when pafsion can be expreffed in the person himself we have no\ need of an emblematic figure to make it known- hunger is placed here for two\ reasons reasons first because want can not be perfectly expressed here in its full force through present intermixture with something else as the happiness of having\ found the means whereby to relieve it to wit the money secondly because\ erifichton is not so naked that his consumed body according to the poet can be\ shewed as occasion requires.\ the reason of my putting in the dog is not only for the enrichment of the dis-\ position but also to shew that he who possesses much wealth should likewise\ watch it moreover it is usual for the country people but chiefly men of sub-\ stance to keep those creatures as well for pleasure as use.\ this fable is seldom seen in painting or exhibited in print otherwise than in\ ovid\'92 metamorphases and that in so simple manner that without the explana-\ tion under it it is scarce intelligible for what can be inferred from an old\ meagre man\'92 receiving purse of money from gentleman with young woman\ appearing between them how can the inequality between riches and poverty\ be conspicuous when they as like in dress as if they were brother and sister and\ this in landscape or the middle of afield where is neither house nor other token\ of their habitation the conclusion of story is not all that is necessary to be red we ought to\ know the origin the fact and sequel of it first it is necessary to know the man\ and who erisichton and his daughter were to express this naturally in their persons\ and dresses secondly we should know by whom they are punished and in\ what manner and lastly by whom and by what means made easy after full\ all their circumstances most naturally such as the place after which the\ enrichments and diminutions will follow of themselves we may at least con-\ ceive that they who will not study the point can not go such lengths as to per-\ form so small story as this much less one of greater dignity in natural and ju-\ dicious manner.\ ishall now agreeable to my promise in the conclusion of the last chapter give\ another embellishing example in an emblem of my own invention for the sake of\ those who will not inure themselves to historians or poets nor confine their free and\ rich thoughts to such restriction.\ sweet repose disturbed by lewdness an emblem.\ here are seen three young nymphs of diana\'92 train tired with honting reposing\ in the shade of the trees little off from the road and near foamy water which\ some fauni and satyrs espying they were resolved to have some sport with them.\ wherefore acquainting their affociates with the matter they silently advanced\ towards the place in abody bringing with them one of the largest priapus termis\ they had together with two panthers vessel of wine and some grapes being\ arrived and seeing the nymphs almost naked and fast asleep they planted before\ the place the aforesaid hideous scare-crow and then softly ftole their hunting\ equipage as quivers arrows bows and hung them on its genitals fasten-\ ing them with the straps which they buckled they moreover decked its head\ with\ and adorning them with vizors not stopping here they seized as many of the\ virgins garments as they could and tossed them upon the high limbs of an ad-\ joining tree and to prevent the nymphs climbing up in order to regain they\ tied the two panthers under the tree and after having set down the wine and\ grapes pleased with the project they covertly retired to peeping place to wait\ the issue on the nymphs awaking each of the gang had brought with him his\ instrument as the double hautboy cymbal tabor timbrel wherewith because it was evening and they might sleep too long to beat up their quarters.\ but the plot soon miscarried through an unexpected accident for another nymph who was possibly seeking for her company happened to arrive at the place and\ seeing the panthers lying under the tree and thinking they were wild shot at\ them and killed one the satyrs seeing this came out of their lurking-hole and\ pursued her but she escaped by flight they then concluded they had waited\ long enough and observing that it grew late and that the aforesaid little bustle\ made the nymphs begin to stir they in full body of satyrs fauni bacchanals even all the tribe of bacchus set up with their instruments so loud noise that the\ nymphs started up on sudden and full of fright looked for their cloaths but\ being now thoroughly awaked the term presented before them with their hunt-\ ing equipage hanging about it this sight but especially that of their cloaths on\ the tree much surprized them and put them to the blush not knowing what\ course to take in the exigence not one durst approach the block in order to take\ her weapons the vile crew all this while kept perdue laughing at them unob-\ served the distressed nymphs perceiving no body near them run to and fro considering how to get their cloaths again but on their approach to the tree the\ panther arose making so great noise that they knew not whether to run cries\ and lamentations here were useless they above an hundred times invoked the aid\ of diana yet in vain the eldest named cleobis at last took courage and went\ up to the term with intention to get the veil from it to cover carile who was na-\ ked saying -ahl why are we such fools to be thus scared and only by wooden black why are we afhamed some-body has certainly been here but now the coast is clear am resolved to throw it down come sisters and\ boldly give an helping hand.-\'97 but she had no sooner uttered these words but\ all the gang appeared mocking scoffing and hooting any one may determine\ who was on that overture most dashed and concerned little satyr shot at the\ term and took the quivers from it shewing the nymphs the unseemly member with an hearty laughter this but especially when other scoffers shewed them\ the cloaths on the tree highly provoked them to take to flight was not ad-\ viseable one pushed them this way another that way during this game noise of cornets was heard which suddenly put an end to the laughter each\ made off leaving all things as they stood the term of priapus fell to the ground and the panther at the tree endeavoured to get loose now diana appears at-\ tended by her train of nymphs who shot their arrows at the lewd crew the dogs at the same time tearing the panther to pieces the fearful nymphs appeared\ much afhamed and prostrated themselves at the feet of the goddess to whom\ they\ they related their misfortunes and the affront put upon them by the gang of\ satyrs shewing her at the same time the term the vizors their cloaths on the\ tree and what else was done in despite to them the goddess to shew her\ resentment gave immediate order to pursue the rioters and would not enlighten\ the night till she had revenged the insolence some accordingly made towards\ the woods others to the brooks and the residue took the field in little time part of them were made captives for of the three who pursued the nymph for\ shooting the panther one was catched in the net and five others together with bacchanal were hawled before diana in irons whom she sentenced to be tied two\ and two together by the feet and whipped by the three affronted nymphs with\ thorns and holm-leaves so severely as almost to kill them three others fhe\ judged to be hung by their tails on the limbs of trees with their heads just touch-\ ing the ground not yet appeased she caused him who was taken in the net to\ be therein plunged into the water by two or three nymphs till he was just ex-\ piring and the water came out of his mouth the bacchanal must see all this on whom was bestowed an hunting knife wherewith if she thought fit to release\ the delinquents to cut off their tails which after much reluctance she was at\ last prevailed upon to do and then tying their hands behind them diana said go now and shew vourselves to the rest of your wanton gang and tell them that\ thus will punish all those who dares to mock the chaste diana and her retinue.\ is not this now though feigned story matter sufficient to furnisn many\ landscapes the landscape-painter ought to observe here representation of\ different paffions bashifulness in the nymphs wanton joy in the saytrs severity\ and resentment in the goddess and distress in the insolents.\ you see here the alluring pleasure of committing crime and the bashfulness\ and distress of those who suffer the evil but at the same time the grievous conse-\ quences and punishment attending wickednefs and insolence in fine the sweets\ and punishment of evil and the reward and unexpected relief of virtue.\ can it be denied that such representation in landscape will not generally\ please surely it is not impossible to make other such designs on wnich oc-\ cafion hope it will not be tiresome to the reader if now shew what is understood\ by the word painter-like as very necessary point for landscape painter.\ chap xv of the word painter-like there is scarce any thing in the world which is not liable to good or bad\ construction and judgment alone chuses in all things medium out of\ these two contrarities which is certainly the most beautiful and best this is an\ especial truth in the art of painting which has such power as to affect people\ two different ways first by virtuous and agreeable representations and in the\ aext place by those which are mean mishapen and contemptible both equally\ efficacious\ efficacious in contrariety.\ the former recreates and charms judicious eye and\ the latter is its aversion.\ it is therefore indisputable that the painter-like or\ most beautiful choice implies nothing else than what is worthy to be painted and that the most mean or what is not beautiful least deserves that honour as\ for instance suppose there were brought before me basket of ripe unripe and\ rotten fruits mixed together must having my judgment chuse the most re-\ lishing or those which appear most beautiful to the eye and reject the rest.\ landscape adorned with sound and straight grown trees round bodied and\ finely leaved spacious and even grounds with gentle ups and downs clear and\ still rivers delightful vistos well ordered colours and an agreeable blue sxy with some small driving clouds also elegant fountains magnificent houses and\ palaces disposed according to the rules of architecture and richly ornamented likewise well-shaped people agreeable in their action and each coloured\ and draperied according to his quality together with cows sheep and other\ well-fed cattle all these say may claim the title of painter-like but piece with deformed trees widely branched and leaved and disorderly spreading\ from east towards west crooked bodied old and rent full of knots and hollow-\ nefs also rugged grounds without roads or ways sharp hills and monstrous\ mountains silling the off-scape rough or ruined buildings with.- their parts lying\ up and down in confusion likewise muddy brooks gloomy sky abounding\ with heavy clouds the field furnished with lean cattle and vagabonds of gypsies such piece say is not to be called fine landscape can any one without\ reason asfert him to be painter-like object who appears as \'e0 lame and dirty\ beggar cloathed in rags splay-footed bound about the head with nasty clout having skin as yellow as backed pudding killing vermin or in fine any\ fuch paltry figure would younot rather conclude suchthings to be the jest of\ painter \'e0\ for my part ibefieve that the difference between the fine and the ugly is too\ great not to make distinction between them iam well pleased that some call\ the works of bamboccio brouwer and moller and the landscapes of brueghel bril bloemart savry berchem and such masters painter-like but oppose to them raphael correggio poussin le brun and in landscape albani genouille on this occasion shall before conclude also- consider the word designer-like word which is as much perverted as the other for instance crooked trees\ abounding with knots and hollownesses rugged clods of earth bursten and sharp\ rocks human bodies robustly and roughly muscled in michael angelo\'92 manner faces large featured long nosed wide mouthed hollowe eyed like tefta\'92 these\ objects we have extolled for designer-like though as absurdly and improperly as\ the masters therefore are very imprudent who encourage their-disciples to\ seck and draw in so troublesome way after such objects as tending to nothing\ else than learning them to make out-lines do they nor ehuse round-about-\ way to bring them into the right path nay how many die in the purfuit who had they taken the other way might easily have got throught where-\ fore fore it is more adviseable to draw after the beautiful and sedate fimplicity and\ greatness of raphael poussin and other excellent mafters than after any of those\ other paltry and mis-shapen objects this must be agreed thar if the bad and\ deformed be painter or designer-like the beautiful is not so the case admits of\ ii\ no alteration and consequently the worst must be best and the best worst.\ both be good there is no room for choice and you may at that rate mingle\ beauty with deformity joy with sorrow ripenness with unripeness gods with\ beggars but since beauty is attracting and deformity offensive this certainly is\ true painter-like which supposes the bestand most agreeable objects which alone\ ought to be called fo and sought for.\ yet there are occasions wherein both must be observed either that the story\ requires it or that by means of deformity we are to set off what is beautiful and make it predominate but theu the painter who understands beauty may\ more easily abate than the other exalt himself above his knowledge and capacity.\ wheresore conclude that beautiful nature is the best choice and the most\ painter-like.\ shall now for the benefit of such artists as are not rich in invention give compendious description of variety of objects in fictitious view.\ chap xvi of painter-like beauty in the open air.\ he dav was almost shut in and the agreeable western sun giving long and\ charming ground-shades when purposed to divert myself with walk not without reflecting how many fine observables-are overlooked which if hand-\ led according to rule would be of service carlessnefs often proceeding from\ too superficial and groundless method of study which will not permit the\ thoughts to six on things of most importance.\ where nothing was-wanting which could tend to the repose of the mind every\ thing was beautiful and orderly blind chance had no hand in this- could\ plainly perceive with- what ardour and pleasure nature and art had mutually be-\ stowed their benefits upon it the roads or passages were so neat and level that\ in walking you hardly seemed to touch the ground sweet and refreshing wind\ reigned there which so allayed the sun\'92 heat as to make it indifferent whether\ you sat in it or in the shade the rich- leaved trees as beautiful in their stems as\ their greens moved almost insenfibly when the young and tender sprouts as\ yet but thinly leaved careffed by the mild and gentle air seemed to rejoice the\ silver leaves by sweet motion glittering like medals the sky was fine blue losing gradually in thin air towards- the horizon the small clouds not violently\ driving this way and that moved slowly and quietly till they got out of sight the\ white\ white swans beheld themselves in the clear brooks freely winding and turning\ without feeling whether with or against the stream.\ in this delightful region found very beautiful fountain the bason of which\ was of white marble furnished towards the road with rocky bowls and scollops\ to receive the water the figures standing upon it were most elegantly chosen round it stood low and close may-trees against the green whereof the white\ marble was magnificiently yet modestly-set off causing thus pleasing mixture\ in its shade.\ from thence took to the right hand along level and broad way on both\ sides faced with parapet of free-stone whereon stood forwards two large vases of\ flesh-coloured marble in shape and ornament like those in the farnese garden wide on top and without covers- but instead of an iphigenia the faint carving\ consisted of dancing women these vases had wonderful fine sweep the figures\ were ordefly disposed and in all parts alike and moderately filled with work and\ because the bas relief arose so- little the whole appeared as yet fresh and un-\ damaged.\ the parapet was built after the doricorder and its pannels were adorned with\ foliage and branch-work twined with reeds.\ the end of it let me into wide sandy road on the left side bordered with gentle flowing river and on the right with sine and large trees along the brink\ of this river were planted only grey and whitisn willows not all alike streight and\ large but some leaning over the water others close branched and leaved others\ again thin and young discovering the glitter of the water on the right side where the road run high stood as say large and heavy trees of various kinds such as oak afn lime wild olive pine cypress some with straight stems round tops swaying branches and fine greens between which some tender\ suckers with their small and upright stalks and airy leaves afforded an inexpresfible\ elegant variety the brown cypresses laden with their fruit added no small lustre\ to the green of the other trees to my great delight under these trees grew\ some wild simples and various kinds of large and small leaved plants intermixed\ with thistles and thorns in an agreeable and most painter-like manner these un-\ der growths but especially the grafs on the sides were in many places dusted by\ the road which by their union caused charming decorum.\ at proper distances along both sides of the road were placed for the ease of\ travellers some low free-stone feats in the form of long and narrow architrave supported by two square pillars.\ going on came to cross-way where found term or guide set up here not to gowrong iwas at \'92stand which way to take in this doubt recollected that those guides have commonly their faces towards the way strangers and travel-\ lers ought to go this term was down tothe lower belley like man yet very\ musculous and the head resembled that of saytr and guarded with two large\ crooked ram\'92 horns it stood in gap between some large trees half fhaded\ with leaves and ivy it seemed to he made of marble but very much be-dripped\ aud fouled with green liquor little from it saw on white marble plinth decumbent statue of naked nymph resting with her elbow on vase shedding\ water water which flowing down the plinth below the way which was there little\ rocky run into the river this figure was very agreeable wondered at first fince it stood not far from and lower than the term that yet it was much cleaner thinking that in such place it could not well maintain its beauty and whiteness but my wonder ceased on perceiving that there were no high trees over it but that\ it had free air another reason was that being so low as to be reached over possibly some draftsman had been at the place and wiped it clean on such conjecture ltook some water out of the vase into my hand and rubbed part of\ the shoulder which confirmed my suspicion for discovered that some parts were\ already become smooth and glossy by being handled and rubbed.\ stepping \'e0 little further saw another sight as fine as the former say fine\ with respect to art it was an ancient tomb or sepulcher of light red marble in-\ termixed with dark grey and white eyes and veins with lid or cover of lapis\ lazuli this tomb was supported by four white marble sphinxes without wings resting on large black marble plinth which through its dustiness seemed to be\ lightisn grey the ground under it was rugged yet level for three or four feet\ round the plinth.- this work was generally encompassed with sand extending to\ the sea-shore which it faced and ten or twelve steps further the sea was seen\ foaming in the middle of the belly of the tomb was round bass-relief within\ compartment of oak leaves it exhibited flying eagle with thunder in its\ bill whence conjectured it might be phaeton\'92 grave and the rather because\ there stood near the corners three very old and large cypresses of which the\ hindmost was as yet whole and sound but the forward ones by weather or other-\ wise so damaged that one had lost its top and the other was on one side half\ unbranched and bare behind this tomb stood large pedestal of greyish-blue\ ftone on which had formerly as it seemed been set an urn now flung down and lying near it half buried in the ground it was somewhat broken and da-\ maged could make but little of the carving upon it since that was under-\ neath and the ear or handle of the urn lay upwards wherefore in order to see\ what it was began to clear the ground away from it but had hardly dug foot deep before perceived piece of chariot and half wheel in the shape\ of star this thought must be the chariot of the sun as being not much unlike it.\ this work thus seeming old and yet the tomb with all its ornaments as new as\ if just set up thought it must have owed its preservation to some heavenly in-\ fluence was so entertained with viewing it on all sides that was wholly taken\ up with it without reflecting that as fortune favoured me \'92otight to hasten to other things of consequence before it grew too late yet resolved though stayed all night not to leave the delicious place before had exactly designed in\ my pocket-book every thing remarkable in it then went ten or twelve steps\ forwards from it in order to have full view of every thing thereabouts- and\ sitting down there opened perfect ordonnance for on seeing the trees-behind\ and on one side of the decumbent nymph and on the other side an- easy afcent with small cottage in low ground behind it could not but observe how ele-\ gant and becoming all the by-works kept themselves the trees behind the tomb\ appeared.\ appeared dark and thereby flung it off strong and brightly the objects on each\ side appearing faint further on discovered small bridge and in the off-\ scape some hills all which presently sketched and shaded marking for\ shortness of time with letters or figures the colours of the stones and their\ tints together with the lightnefs and darknefs of one object against another and\ also against the sky.\ having done with this and walking further on the right hand came to very large and weighty bridge of one arch which had an exceeding great span\ ending in the crown in point this opening discovered an even plain reach-\ ing almost to the horizon with cottages and houses here and there in vil-\ lage-like manner they were not meanly boarded and plaistered like ours but\ regularly built with stone though plain and without ornament this bridge\ came from behind the trees on the right hand and preserved communication\ over the road with an high and large rock on the sea-shore it was possibly pla\'ac\ ced here for the sake of dry passage to the other side in case of floods.\ going under this arch found myself in the open field near another sort of\ common buildings which at distance could not perceive on account of\ some intervening trees these were herdsmens habitations and built with mean\ materials yet in fine manner with respect to art some stood on ground-sills others went up two or three steps but the generality of them had their entrances\ even with the ground some had square doors with circular windows over\ them or else round frames stuck instead of bass-relief with rams ox or goats\ sculls cut in white stone according to the condition of the inhabitant the\ lower windows were in form like the doors and diameter and half higher than\ wide or else twice the breadth in height the upper windows of such as had\ two stories or small garrets were mostly round some but single-storied had\ compass-headed door-ways and over them long octangular windows and if\ any smaller over them they were square the roofs were generally flattisn and tiled for bringing off the water forwards some in my opinion much ex-\ celled others in grace having over the door-ways small balconies with compass-\ doors into them and the windows on each side square and equally high and\ over them round ones again on each side of the aforesaid doors or entrances were made in the walls square vent-holes like niches contracting inwardly and cross-barred with iron the pediments were doric or lonic and of whitish\ stones the lower story grev and the rest free-stone some were painted light-\ reddishi others white free-stone or grey some doors had pillars or seats on each\ side some houses saw also joined with walls wherein were round holes.\ here and there appeared large gates as of neat-houses one was open and\ seemed to be like place covered in most of the windows had wooden shutters which hinged on top and kept open by sticks those houses to secure them\ from the overslow of the river running in the neighbourhood stood much above\ the level of the way in fine omitted no remarkable relating to these coun-\ try peoples manner of dwelling.\ somewhat further and without this village came up to round temple having lofty and elegant frontispiece it waa ascended by flight of ten or\ twelve\ twelve steps with free-stone ballustrade on each side adorned with two sphinxes facing each other which were headed with caps and bodied with houses or co-\ verings after the antique manner landing on these steps came up to por-\ tico fronted with eight columns entablature and pediment of the lonic order the pediment had fine intire bafs-relief not much rising the columns were\ continued round the temple two and \'92two together resting plinths and basements.\ over their ornaments ran gallerv divided into parts by pedestals whereon\ stood fine statues one answering each pillar behind the ballustrade of the gal-\ lery ran up pilasters of the corinthian order two and two together and between\ them large windows finely wrought according to that order as was the frize\ and cornice with grave foliage modillions on this arose an open dome inclosed with close ballustrade covered in with compass-roof whereon was set\ sun.\ though was not mych conversant with architecture yet perceived very\ regular disposition in this building which among these adjoining also orderly\ and beautiful loftily and magnificently distinguished itself appearing like pre-\ cious stone set in enamel though neither had other ornaments than simply those\ of the order the contiguous houses were low and extensive with high chim-\ behind these stood nies or towers yielding in my opinion fine decorum.\ close plantation of trees mostly pines and cypresses which added no small lustre\ to all this stone-work on each side of the before-mentioned steps was fountain\ or square bason adorned with two pretty large lionesses couching on pedestals\ and spouting water.\ thus faricied saw this glorious lofty and especially painter-like sight when\ we come to treat of architecture and the choice of beauty\ within doors shall be\ at the trouble of stepping into this temple todescribe its inward wonders.\ oh how comfortable is the shore after tempestl what defference is\ there between lovely sun-shine and gloomy night between fresh and lively\ youth and stale old age love solaces in gardens of pleasure and beautiful\ palaces but envy lurks in desolate wildernesses among the rubbisn of things\ which it defaces abandon then true and young artists vour blind zeal beau-\ ty does not triumph nor is here attended with what is deformed spoiled fouled or broken but takes up with things simple or less beautiful without defects.\ wherefore think that these two kinds of beauty differ as much as the verdant\ and delightful summer and the dry and barren winter who in building for\ pleasure would make patch or in making garden fill it with half-rotten\ trees he must be an unaccountable man who seeks delight in desolate wil-\ derness is it not then evident that those men have vicious tastes who endea-\ vour to fetch beauty out of deformity princefs sufficiently shines among her\ ladies by her state and costly attire without setting off her lustre by comparison\ with swine-herd when we meet with fine marble statues are they not pre-\ served with care from ill usage and the injuries of time though the latter spares\ for nothing gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed s\'e6pe cadendo.\ but probability ought to be observed in all things that we need not inquire what is modern or ancient without being therefore broken or over foul since\ stones much handled will become sinooth yet without damage and why should\ man be made judge of what is beautiful and fine who came from foreign\ and wild country and never saw beauty in oppofition to true beauty let us now represent the other sort and leave the\ point to the determination of the judicious.\ chap xvii of things deformed and broken falsely called\ painter-like.\ hanging the scene we shall now consider what is also though unjust-\ ly called painter-like and this in an imaginary way like the pre-\ ceding.\ in walking saw large gate the door whereof was broken to pieces by an\ huge oak blown down against it creeping through it found myself as in strange country so very rugged desolate and rocky without paths or roads that\ knew not where to walk the ground was no where so even as to reston here\ saw the fragment of column yet lying so obliquely that could not sit on\ it near it lay piece of frize and cornice with an end sticking up and not\ much further was another stone pretty level but in morass abounding with\ vermin nevertheless endeavoured to get upon this last stone and then with\ my cloak under me laid myself down upon it which had no sooner done but somebody called \'97-hark ye go from it you lie in my way.\ not\ dreaming any person could be here suddenly looked back in surprize and sawa\ young man sitting on an hillock who as he said was drawing after the stone laid on but on recollection he again called out that if would stay there\ but half quarter of an hour fhould do him great favour this consented\ to not without afking him what he was going to do with such paltry fragments answered ee they are the finest things in the world to introduce into our\ pieces when have such fine parcel as that piece of column and this water\ before me with the addition of stump of tree and small dark off-scape be-\ hind it they together immediately compose perfect ordonnance oh you\ can not imagine how extraordinary and full of variety these objects are this is\ the finest place on earth for curious artist all is painter-like every thing lies\ so loose pretty and wild that few good masters would refuse coming hither to\ design these wonders and nothing but the present high wind hinders their being\ here now \'92\ upon this prattle viewed him from top to toe he sat all in an heap with board in his lap and small ink-horn and magnifying or spectacle-glafs in his\ hand on his head he had night-capalmost down to his eyes with his left leg\ over his hat poffibly to save it from the wind small light coming from between\ the trees shone on his lap poor man thought how feelingly you can talk\ of what is painter-like and what satisfaction you must find in those things if\ there be any more artists of your stamp this must be the place to find them in.\ the truth is the more viewed him and heard his talk the more blamed my\ own judgment for not discovering such beauties as he did now perceiving he\ had done went towards him to see his work but before could come up to\ hiin he had packed up his awls and was gone another way behind the trees near the place where he had been sitting found another spark who stood and\ drew after small rivulet full of big and little clods of earth and pebbles which\ he neatly designed on drawing paper aud marked with their different colours.\ his whole port-folio was full of such-like painter-like trumpery such as muddy\ water decayed and broken stones pieces of wood barren shrubs and bushies rough grounds toads snakes afking him what branch he made his study he answered that be had not yet practised any but hoped if he could get all\ those things and perform them well to become good landscape-painter ee for said he those objects are so uncommon that the best masters give themselves the\ trouble to seek them but continued he can not but wonder that some search\ here and in other places and can scarce find piece to their go\'fbt nay often re-\ turn without doing any thing when on the contrary discover thousand\ things both delightful and useful whenever cast my eyes were to design\ every thing meet with should have work for many years look there said\ he yonder is one of that tribe prying about have not yet seen him sit down\ any where thought within myself that it was strange any man should run\ about in an error in so wild and desolate place.\ going on icame to \'e0 large and hideous rock split through and having one\ part hanging forward full of sharp angles open hollows and cuts over-run here\ and there with mofs and barren shrubs on the right side was deep morassy\ valley going off very steep and on the left appeared an inaccessible ruined\ building like an heap of stone swarming with adders snakes and other vene-\ mous creatures behind me the ground was so uneven full of ups and downs and pathlefs that thought it impossible to get from the place on the point of\ returning back isaw man creep on all-four out of one of the holes or hollows\ of the rock and thereby cleared passage for me this man told me what won-\ derful things were to be seen on the other side but was scarce crept half\ through before heard frightful thunder-clap which shook the wh\'f4le rock wherefore redoubling my speed and being got through found that the top of\ the rock was tumbled over the right side which made me suddenly retire from\ thence fearful that another part might fall apon me what also raised my aver-\ fion was the sight of tomb crushied to pieces and almost sunk into the ground and near-it lying piece of large trunk of white marble could perceive by\ the base that it had been term and being curious to know what might be\ hidden behind it igot on the tomb and saw through the trees downwards frightful pool therefore took to the left where thought the ground was\ more level three or four stepsfrom thence sawa white paper fluttering before\ me along the ground and after it ablue one somewhat larger both which ran\ after and took up the blue paper appeared to be drawing after the aforesaid\ tomb when intire and standing which made me judge that he must have been good master who had thus improved it in the draught possibly thought he\ is hereabouts my conjecture was not groundless for stepping little further found the poor wretch- lying under large oak which had been thunder-struck the stem was cleft from top to bottom and large limb lay across the man\'92 bo-\ dy his port-folio lay near him emptied of all his drawings this sight affright-\ ed me and approaching near heard him sigh he perceiving me called out\ presently for help cleared the limb from off his body as well as could whereby and after much pains he disengaged himselfrom the leaves he was to my wonder no where hurt save little in his left hand yet of no consequence.\ ireturned him his papers and afked him whether he had seen the tomb in the\ condition wherein it was drawn he answered he had when going to shew\ it to me he in amazement started back on finding it in ruins oh says he does\ this lie also tumbled down and my drawing scarce finishedl we then went\ together further up towards the left and regained most of his papers he\ told me that his companion had left him and run away on the approach\ of the storm which induced me to think he was the person who\ came creeping on all-four through the aforesaid hole.\ on our coming down we found many already drawing after the broken\ tree under which the good man had lain with the utmost application.\ it was their unanimous opinion never to have seen tree more painter-\ he shewed them his drawing and\ this talk surprised us both.\ like.\ said that the tomb was the only object he found intire thereabouts and\ this being demolished there was nothing left to please him but this\ they scoffed at and answered him that such things might easily be made\ out of one\'92 head or found in prints.\ in short it was great diversion to me to see one as hotly clambering up\ one place and another creeping through some hole for the sake of designing\ the rock and tomb tuinbled down as if they were going after treasure.\ taking leave of this person pursucd my way but was obliged for\ the sake of ruinous fountain the vases mouldings and other ornaments\ whereof lay across and stopped the way to take to the right hand on\ the remains adorned with bafs relief found not one intire figure every\ thing being excessively mouldered fouled and over-run with wild plants and\ shrubs its bason lay awry with corner sunk into the ground broken .\ and full of earth or mud boy who had been sitting there came and\ afked me whether could not tell him which part of this heap of stones\ was the most painter-like \'92te have been long making choice says he of something good out of it but the number confounds me the parts are\ all so broken that can not find so much as whole hand or foot have shewing me his drawing pitched upon this among them with much\ ado believe verily there was not such another undamaged bit in the\ whole ruin though of little consequence it was plinth with the right\ leg and foot of apollo wanting the great toe he said that he with eight\ others had been drawing every thing after the heap except this fragment the foot of which was not according to their fancies broken enough comforted him with saying that he had picked out the very best thing of\ all when he owned that he had made the choice through the persuasion of\ another who was now gone away to whom the leg by means of the sandal\ and straps was not unknown this boy thought ought to be set in right way and his simplicity pleased me.\ turning then to the right hand as have said came into dismal\ place which by the largeness of the pavement and arch work supported\ by great pillars seemed formerly to have been palace.\ it was here so lonesome and gastly that was seized with cold swcat wherefore mended my pace in order to get out of it and being got to\ the other side and ten or twelve paces from it found myself again at\ the lake before-mentioned near which lay shattered tomb with the corpse\ half tumbled out the head and one arm rested on large root of tree\ lying near it the lid was almost slid off and just on the totter and snake from underneath was creeping into the tomb sight frightful\ enough.\ the sun now on the point of setting darted his refulgent

of the less knowing..\ be therefore docible artifts not so intent in gaining your embellisn-\ ean have them by vrote sueh elde eh lidin prieehpildi inten doubes than bring ye to certainties.\ in order then to qualify the judgment to make good choice recourse\ may always be had to the remains of those great masters raphael poussin and many others to enlighten us by imitating their illustrious examples.\ the end of the sixth book.\ he\ ara of taentng.\ book vi.\ of portraiture.\ embl\'e9m touching the handling portraits.\ nature with her many breasts is in sitting posture near\ her stands child lifting her garment off her shoulders on her\ other side stands -truth holding mirrour before her wherein\ she views herself down to the middle and is seemingly surprised\ at it on the frame of this glass are seen gilt pallet and\ pencils trazh has book and palm branch in her hand.\ chap of portraits in general.\ since we meet with no presidence in the art nor pretend to insist\ on ceremonies we shall treat of things as they occur to -us and as clearly and profitably as possible.\ but first give me leave to say that have often wondered how any man\ can prefer slavery to liberty and by departing from the essence of the art -\ subject\ of portraiture.\ subject himself to all the defects of nature speak of such great masters as\ van dik lely lan loo the old and young bakker and others who though pos-\ sessed of great talents in the art postponed what is noble and beautiful for what\ is nore ordinary and common the truth is and we have seen that sooner by\ this means than others men have obtained the honour of gold medals and chains nay the liberty of prescribing laws to princes staring them in the face drawing their pictures and many other privileges whereby they have acquired\ great riches what an unheard-of reward did not apelles receive when alexan-\ der gave him his dear campaspe in order to save the life of that great artist by\ satisfvinghis love inslamed by drawing the picture of that beauty when consider these things am surprised that all painters do not give in wholy to\ pertraiture since now -- days money is preferred to learning lucre to virtue and\ honours dispensed to men in proportion to their riches but leaving this sub-\ ject we will proceed thoroughly to consider every thing relating to that branch\ of the art.\ as in music and singing good ear is requisite so in portraiture it is impossible\ to excel without good eyc such an one mean as is governed by sedate and\ sober sensation and not by self-love or passion next is required regular design containing an exact proportion or division of the parts not only of the face but\ of the whole body that the sitter may be known by his picture which may be\ most agreeably done by mixing the fafhion with what is painter-like as the great\ lely did and which is called the painter-like or antique manner but by the ig-\ norant commonality the roman manner.\ next we must be thoroughly judicious in the graceful choice of the light and\ the place where the person is to sit that the face may appear to the best advan-\ tage- and then the body is to be disposed to the most natural and becoming\ posture.\ the next business and which gives it the greatest lustre is the colouring that\ each person and his parts may have their proper colour and such as appears in\ his daily converse not such as proceeds from extraordinary emotions let the\ artist beware of inelining to any particular manner like some whose work is\ thereby better known to be theirs than the friends of the sitter know the picture\ to be his.\ as for the choice of light in order to apply it most advantageously for the be\'ac\ nefit of either sex it is certainly matter of great moment since the fair sex\ commonly partake of more delicacy and grace than men so they must have light as beautiful and agreeable as their persons.\ but ere we proceed further it will not be improper to look into the origin of\ portraits in order thereby to shew-the aim of those who cause themselves to be\ drawn and the profits which masters get thereby.\ the ancients used to cause those from whom the common-wealt had received\ extraordinary benefits either in war or civil affairs or for imminence in religion to be represented in marble or metal or in picture that the sight of them by\ those honours might be spur to posterity to emulate the same virtues this\ honour\ honour was first begun with their deities afterwards it was paid to heroes and\ of consequence to philosophers orators religious men and others not only to\ but now\ perpetuate their virtues but also to embalm their names and memories.\ it goes further person of any condition whatsoever have he but as much mo-\ ney as the painter afks must sit for his picture this is great abuse and sprung\ from as laudable cause.\ in noblemen indeed it is very commendable custom because being descend-\ ed from great families the lustre of these ought to shine to encourage their suc-\ cessors to keep up their glory and to prevent sullying it by unworthy actions.\ as for \'e0 general or admiral who has died in the bed of honour gratitude think obliges us to raise monument to his glory and to animate brave souls\ in future times to immitate his virtue but what is this to the vulgar pride on-\ ly spurs them to it the rich do it that their children may boast of it the\ master of numerous family does it that the world may know he is father he who has fired magazine of the enemy must be drawn with this great ac-\ tion though perhaps tnere was no body to hinder him has citizen\'92 wife but\ an only babe he is drawn at half year old at ten years old he sits again and for the last time in his twenty-fifth year in order to shew her tender folly and then she stands wondering how man can so alter in that time is not this\ weighty reason reproveable custom if painters did not gain by it but\ again portraits are allowable when lover is absent from his mistress that they\ may send each other their pictures to cherisn and increase their loves man\ and wife so parted may do the same.\ but to return to the original matter must warn the artists not to give in too\ much to what is common or humour ignorant people so much as not to re-\ serve to themselves some liberty of doing what they think proper for the sake of\ reputation surely this can not be strange advice for master who prefers money\ before art has no more dangerous rock to split on since the ignorant multi\'ac\ tude usually insist to be drawn according to their own whims one says \'92to \'e0\ good master \'97te draw me thus or thus let me have one hand on my breast and the other on table \'92 another must have flower in his hand or flower-\ pot must be by him another must have dog or other creature in his lap another will have his face turned this or that way and some who would be drawn\ in the roman manner must be set off by globe or clock on table whether\ such ornaments be proper or not on mentioning the roman manner find that\ it signifies loose airy undress somewhat savouring of the mode but in no wise\ agreeing with the ancient roman habit.\ but many other inconveniences attend portraiture as first the ignorance of\ those who sit for some of them having no right notion of their own mein and\ shape often refer the judgment of fine portrait to the eye of achild or servant and what they say monsieur and madam believe either to its praise or dis-\ commendation.\ second inconveniency arises from wedded inclination which any one has to\ fuch and such objects judging as they like or dislike not only of pictures but\ even the life itself for though they may be afraid to pass sentence on \'e0 fine\ history\ hiftory or landscape yet portrait must not escape them as thinking it within the\ reach of their capacities.\ thirdly we nnd many artists never pleased with other mens works but being\ full of themselves despise every thing they see though as good as their own and\ this perhaps on no better bottom than pique against the artist\'92 conversation talk dress or money or else because of his greater fame and yet if ten per-\ sons happen to applaud fine picture of this eye-sore master they will at that\ juncture chime in with them to sereen their prejudice and on the contrary if but single person afterwards find fault they immediately turn the tables against\ ten others again if apiece of their friend be brought on the carpet though\ never so faulty they will applaud and justify it at any rate though against their\ own convictions of conscience but this partial and prejudiced humour is most\ prevailent in those who know least.\ fourth set of men are those who being always of an unealy temper dislike\ their own but applaud every thing other men do these indeed are not so noxious\ as the former because they only hurt themselves whereas the others hurt every\ body.\ fifthly there are prejudiced set of men who find no taste but in easv and-\ grave airs and postures others in stirring and hurrying ones others in violent ones some think that womens draperies ought to be loose and soft others will\ have them of velvet or fattin or else party-coloured this thinks that dark or\ brown ground beft sets off figure anether chuses landscape or green curtain right or wrong are the- colours beautifully chosen the picture smells of them are they broken they seem muddy and foui how can portait please so many\ opinions it is not like an history full of figures where we can introduce va-\ riety of sedate and stirring action more or less beautiful colouring loose or set\ draperies dark or light grounds because this is but single figure.\ our businefs then must be to find way between soylla and charybdis to enable\ the artist to paint good portrait for he who makes due reffexion on every thing can prepare himself to overcome the aforesaid difficulties.\ chap ii of the defects in the face and other parts.\ he defects which are seen in nature or in simple life are three-\ fold.\ natural ones.\ accidental ones.\ useful ones.\ the natural ones are wry face fquint eyes wry mouth nose .\ the accidental ones are loss of an eye cut on the cheek or other part of the\ face pits of the small pox and the like.\ the\'92usual ones are those habitsito-which we aecustom gurselves from- our in\'ac\ faney to wit contraction of the eyes and mouth or closing or gaping of the\ latter or drawing it in somewhat to this or that side upwards or down-\ wards .\ as for-otherbodily infirmities how many have wry necks hunch backs bandy\ legs withered or short arms or one shorter than the other dead or lame hands\ or fingers among these some are unavoidable and others may be either left\ out or handsomely hidden the necessary ones ought to be secn because they\ help the likeness such as wry face squint eyes low forehead thinnefs and\ fatness wry neck too short or too long nose wrinkles between the eyes -\ ruddiness onpaleness of the cheeks or lips pimples or warts about the mouth and such like among those which may be hidden or left out count blind\ eye wound wen mole pits of small pox too many pimples red blue oghairy spot as also habital usages such as- hanging lips pinchings or draw-\ ingsof the-mouth and eyes.\ ithink also that the common and useful dress of person is great addition\ te-likenefs for no sooner is the dress altered but the look does the same and\ shews itselfeither more or lefs pleasing and agreeable and thereby the person be-\ comes more tor lefs known to obviate which advise the artist above all things to get first true likeness of the face and paint it to the sitter\'92 satisfaction and\ then he may freely manage all the rest as he thinks fit and thereby get honour\ and commendation since the life itself in such dress can not any more alter.\ the painter should likewise discover and- know as much as possible the nature\ and temper of the person sitting and in what circumstances lies his favourite plea-\ sure that he may when sitting be entertained with talk pleasing to him and\ his air thereby kept steady and serene and his posture natural and easy avoiding\ every thing tending towards sorrow or frightful relations for these are apt to ruffle\ the mind and so to discompose the face that it can not easily be got right again but if the sitter himself do by his talk difcover his own bent the painter ought\ to humour it to the last whether if-be jocose or moderate without exaggeration-\ or diminution yet with such variety as not to prove tiresome and make the\ face alter.\ he who can not thus-manage and furnish outa discourse will be the longer ere\ he hit the likeness some will even sit three or four times and each time with -\ different air and were they to sit ten times fancy something new would still\ offer.\ another hindrance may be that painting-rooms are often hung with such sinutty\ but\ pictures as frequently put virgins to the bluss or alter their countenances.\ though for improvement fine pictures are necessary to be always in view yet in paintingeroom there ought not to hang the wanton picture of mars and venus\ casched by vukan or dina\'92 bathing though done by van dyk or joseph and-\ potiphar\'92 wife for though these may hang in corner yet when the eye hag\ once catched them it will retain them because theirideas make continal iin-\ preffions on ithe mind even against its will and therefore the bare remembrance\ of such things must put young and chaste virgin to the blush must it aot create\ longing\ longing to see picture of two beggar-boys fall greedily on ripe fruit the one\ eagerly biting piece of fresh melon and the other bunch of grapes with the\ juice falling down his chin on his naked breast the room then should be hung\ with every thing modest as fine landscapes and flower-pieces which will amuse\ the sight without disturbing or tireing the mind or altering the countenance fine portraits will also animate \'e0 sitter to keep him serene and make him emu-\ lous of their airs large looking-glais may be likewise of service if so hung that\ the sitter can see himself in it for thereby discovering any disagreeableness in his\ look he will correct himself in order to have as good an air as he desires and by\ such methods as these painter may become great.\ we will now proceed to consider how many mistakes some painters commit in\ relation to the first observation of natural defects these endeavour to their utmost\ power to express punctually the deformities and defects of face without\ scruple to wit blind or squint eye or the like though they know that it is an\ enemy to grace and on no other ground than false belief that it creates greater\ likeness but who loves to be reproached with his defects when they can be art-\ what would become of grace which teaches that painter-\ fully hidden should make as beautiful choice as possible which these blemisnes obscure think therefore that we can not lay too great strefs on what concerns the make position and turn of face that the eye be not offended with blemisn or deformi-\ ty or the posture look disagreeable.\ how monstrous is the picture of certain admiral who seems to stab himself\ with his staff of command and has defective eye turned directly to the light be-\ cause according to the saying he is best known by it would not -more pro-\ file view have suited him better or to have flung the side with the blind eye into\ fhade would it not be ridiculous to paint the duke of luxemburgh in profile to\ represent him the better and that his hunch-back might be the more vifible for\ no other reason than that most people knew he had one nature abhors deformity and we can not behold it without aversion and quick turn of the eye from it squint-eyed person can not see himself in the glass\ without inward trouble especially one of the fair sex who in other respects tolerably handsome can not bear to see an instance of her deformity in another but will basfifully look off or down to the ground how much worie then must-\ it look in picture the life may be sometimes seen on an handsome side which\ in an ill chosen picture we can never expect whence it is natural for one who has\ blemish or defect in an eye or cheek always to turn the best side to the light-\ in short we do not desire to do any thing walk stand fit talk but with be-\ coming air have we fore eyes we hide them under our hats or if lame hip we endeavour to walk briskly have we fome humour or pimples in cheek we\ either hide them with patch or paint the other side like it have we bad teeth we keep the mouth shut ora lame hand and hide it not under our coats or in\ our pockets if nature acts so how can such defects please in picture such flattery then as is agreeable to art is not only aflowable but commendable es-\ pecially when the sitter is so disposed in posture that the painter himfelf can not perceive it.\ alke any one wha wears piece of black silk over an hollow eye whether he de-\ fires to be draun from that fide believe nots aperson with wooden leg cares-\ not that the deformity should appear in picture such an one ought to be drawn\ in half length only but if the heroe insist upon the introducing such leg on supposition that is an honour to have lost limb in his country service the\ painter must then comply with his defires or else contrive it lying on table\ covered with red velvet if he desire it after the antique manner it must be con-\ trived in bas relief wherein the occasion of it may be represented or it may\ hang near him on wall with its buckles and straps as is done in hunting equi\'ac\ pages or else it may be placed among the ornaments of architecture to be more\ in view but what praise or advantage will an artist get by this when judicious\ master sees the picture he may perhaps plead in excuse that the sitter would\ have it fo this indeed can not argue against because we usually say to whom\ we employ do as would have you right or wrong we have an instance of gentleman who being drawn in little and comparing the smallness of the eyes\ with his own afked the painter whether he had such however in compli-\ ance and for his pleasure he desired that one eye at least might be as big as his\ own the other to remain as it was sad case miserable subjection for\ though we can not compell others to be of our opinions yet pity those who must\ fubmit to incongruities but not to dishearten the artist too much we will\ proceed to chap iii the observables in portrait particularly that of-\ woman.\ elf-conceit and self-love seem nathral to all but especially to the female\ sex who whether their pictures are drawn on their own accounts or thro\'92\ the desire of others imagine they deserve such homage nor stops it here for\ although they may possess tolerable share of beauty yet that is not satisfactory\ enough they must be flattered and their pictures painted in the most beautiful\ light and unhappy is the painter who abates but half drachm of such beauty.\ for these reasons the master is-obliged to have principal regard to light and\ colour but to the light chiefly since it is well known that nothing gives greater\ offence to ignorant people than shades and still more when they are strong and\ broad they believe they speak to the purpose in objecting well how can it be\ possible that my neck and cheek should have such large shades when idaily con-\ sult my glass and find my skin all of colour and white and \'92then the painter\ is blamed but are not such reasons weak and absurd since ifa man how\ tenacious soever meet another who by long absence and alteration of dress is got out of his memory he will naturally turn him to-the light in order to know\ him and his features this conduct has been wonderfully observed by barocci in-\ his\ his picture- of mary paying visit t elizabrth twhen big with-child in-which by\ his method-of placing the figures and the ataegtion of the faces we seem tot\ hear them talk looking earnestly at each other.\ think those masters have made the best choice who have chosen front-lighto and thereby kept.their colours most natural and beautiful since thig-light is cer-\ tainly most advantageous whether the picture hang-against wall or where-else.\ but here seems to-arise .difficulty since we formerly said that we ought to fix certain place and the point of sight and distance and to dispose the light so\ as it can fall on that place to-which the answer is easy porfraits have no fixed\ place as we shall further shew in another chapter as also how far and-on what.\ occasions we must- confine ourselves to that rule.\ the best way to settle this- point is to follow those who have chosen their-light almost fronting and as before said such colouring as naturally appears to the eye besides good choice since think the case of placing portrait te be-the-\ same as that of curious china which whether it stand high or low shews- itself\ every where beautiful my reason for this is that objects which have such .\ front-light have an exceeding fine effect and great relief when they come\ against dark ground and still finer when the light falls on them somewhat\ from on high if tha-sitter and some accidents do not hinder it in whigh case reason and our eye must best-direct us viewjbut this fineness in asposture painted\ leaning over an hatch or out at window and what great decorum the-\ touches and shades about the most relieved parts cause in such an object as\ leonardo da vinci has well observed.\ of the accidents which just now spoke off shall mention two or three some\ persons may be toa long and sharp-mosed or too hollowreyed for such low\ light is most proper but where it is otherwise an high light in this manner judicious master ought to help the defects of \'92nature without adding to or ta-\ king any thing from them yet to the sorrowof impartial masters the contraty.\ is too much seen for as have said that history-painters chuse and follow what\ they have the greatest inclination for so it is with many portrait-painters their\ work is better known by their particular manner than the sitter by his picture.\ permit me here to make comparison between those two great masters titian\ and van dyk with respect to the judgment have heard made on their works.\ of the latter it is said that in the delign grace and choice of portrait-figure he was the most skilful nevertheless have seen many of titian\'92 who in most-\ mens opinions has the greater reputation which scemed to me incomparable though less agrecable here my position about the particular choice of masters takes effect again because think that the defect in agreeableness is peculiar to titian\'92 country and limits his choice and therefore he is the lefs culpabl\'e9 when on the contrary our region prefers what is gay and elegant before the.\ majestic and grave and likeness is the chief object both of the sitter and the.\ artist every thing else being looked on as by-works and ornament poor judg-\ ment methinks of people of sense for if portrait have not besides likeness an\ agrceable disposition the little knowledge of the master will presently appear.\ it is true that we meet with many odd faces in the life especially among vul-\ gar\ gar and clovnisn people yet fay that be they ever so rude agrecableness\ should be observed in their pictures by agreeableness understand the dispo-\ fition of posture in general as when the face has an advantageous turn more or\ lefs totthe light up or down in order to create handsome shades and to shun\ unbecoming ones for every face requires particular observation one an high\ light another low one this side-light that an almost fronting one speak not yet of many other requifites such as the sway of the neck shoulders\ or breaft or of proper back-ground all which considerations are essential to fine portraft as well in refpect tothe naturaluess and colour \'e0s to the motion but ef the light and back-grounds we shall say more in the next chapter and\ now return to our comparifon some think that van dyk\'92 paintings are but wa-\ ter-colours compared with titian\'92 whose pictures have so much force in colour-\ ing fights and fhades that those of the other can not stand in competition with\ them nay that his colouring is inimitable and whereby that of van dyk ap-\ pears faint and weak ridiculous opinion indeed however that van dyk and\ jitian differ much in colouring allow but neverthelefs think that we need\ not run to the italians to prove it since if the stress lay in strong colouring on-\ ly rembrant need not give way to trtian but whence arises the mistake most\ men chime in with thofe simple judges who approve no histories landscapes or\ portraits that are not painted in the jralian manner my opinion is that the\ whole of the matter l\'efes more in the difference of climates than in the handlings\ of the masters for let an englifhman\'92 picture hang near an stalian\'92 both\ handled with equal fkill and each represented according to his hue and nature there will appear great difference between them the sweetning softness of the\ englihman will charm as much on onc hand as the strong and glowing colout\ of the italian on the other on which of these two pictures has the master be-\ stowed the most pains are not both praise-worthy as having each expressed the\ character natural to his figure but not to go abroad for comparisons with respect to particular climes our\ own netherland affords differences enough two brothers of the same parents are\ born in the same town and hour one of them is brought up to the sword and\ endures all the fatigues of war and the incommodities of hailx snow wind rain sun smoak of salt-petre whereby his complexion is altered and becomes\ swarthy the other brother contrarily is educated in saloons sine apartments\ and tender conversations by which means time can not so much affect him each\ sits for his picture to \'e0 feparate and good master now these two pictur\'e9s being\ brought together will the painter be censured for the difference of tints and fea-\ tures or will it be objected that nature has not been rightly followed or that\ the pictures are not like an impartial judge will determine that both are good\ and natural and that each master has duly mixed art with nature.\ have discovered great oversight in some artists which is that when the\ face was finished they had no further regard to the life but chose posture at\ pleafure out of drawings or prints without considering whether it suited the per-\ son and whether the dress was proper to the condition and countenance of the\ sitter nay whether the head matched the hody certainly great heedlessness for-\ for if body must be added what more proper than the life itself and though\ many disre-\ the layman be good and helpful yet it is not equal to the life.\ gard this thinking they have done enough in hitting the face but all the while\ they are preposterousty joining an airy drapery to sedate and grave head and grave and stiff dress to merry face but further the hands are entirely neglect-\ ed if pair of fine ones can be got of some other master these are made use of without regard to the life which may perhaps have short thick and coarse\ hands how can these things agree is it not almost the same as to dress flora\ \'97we have the\ with the drapery of vesta and vesta with flora\'92 artists say prints of van dyk lely kneller and others for fine examples and as lely has\ followed van dyk in graceful action and draperies so we have liberty to immitate\ him and others which willingly agree but then we ought to do it on\ the same footing as he did in his postures he has not merely and without alte-\ ration followed van dyk and still less without judgment as may be seen in his\ of .\ two celebrated pictures of nell gzuynn and the -\ the one wanton and buxom lady he has so represented and the other being widow and more sedate appears more modest.\ by this rule we must walk in the use of those great masters but if things be\ done without making distinction of persons and their conditions the artist will\ work to his dishonour he who steals thus may indeed call'the work his own without reproach none will object as michael angelo did once to painter who\ practised it to excess -what will become of your pictures at doomsaay when the\ parts shall return to their ozen wholes seeing your works are made up of stolen pieces \'e0\ moreover in this theft we ought well to observe how masters best applied\ every thing with respect to youth and age as well in postures as draperies and\ by-ornaments what suits an alderman or heroe merchant or citizen noble-\ man or plebean hereby we shall discover the aims of the great masters in thus\ managing these particulars and learn to immitate their beauties in sweet and\ agreeable manner.\ chap iv of the choice of lights draperies and grounds in portrait -- and of the point of sight.\ the preceding chapter we have laid down as rule that front-light is\ the best to be chosen and the most beautiful especially in the fair sex and\ think it the more necessary when the face itself is also chosen in front because\ then the greatest force will fall directly upon the most rising or relieved parts but shall now subjoin that since the life however we dispose it either from or\ near the light fronting or in profile yet supports itself though the light be not\ advantageously chosen which portrait can not do we therefore must needs in\ order to make it appear as it ought to be accommodate the light to the dispo\'ac\ sition of the face for instance when the face turns somewhat sideways the light\ must be adapted to it when it is quite in profile side-light will be best be-\ cause\ cause then great mafs of light remains together to wit in the forehead nose\ and cheeks which are not broken by any ground-shade but united by the\ roundness which shews us how to represent rising nature and causes becoming\ relief.\ we see that many without difference be the figure in full proportion or in\ little give the touches under the nose so black and dark that it seems as if black beetle were proceeding thence whereas it is certain and nature teaches it that when the light falls strong on the nose the nostrils and their ground-shades\ can never appear so black and yet some think they have done great feats in using\ force and strength and will do it even in fair and tender face and no bigger\ than the palm of the hand although the deepest black should not have force\ enough to shade the other objects of \'e0 darker colour such as hair cloak or\ other garment by which sort of management the face seems to jump out of the\ frame and to desert the wig hair and garment we must not so understand when we teach that the face must have the main light we mean only that all\ ought to keep due order that it may look natural each colour of the by-\ work ought according to its lightness or darkness to have its moderate shade\ and dark touches as the matter it consists of is either solid or thin and transpa\'ac\ rent and in proportion as the objects lessen so must the force of their colours\ diminish as shall be further illustrated in-the following chapter to which for\ brevity we refer we see an excellent example of this management in the fa-\ mous netscher\'92 artful portraits wherein he has judicioussy handled the darkest\ shades and main-light-touches according to the natural force of the colour.\ for the better understanding of further observables have found it proper to\ mention some other particulars concerning the disposition of lights according to\ occasion consisting in light against dark and the contrary and though every\ thing thereby becomes relieved and is set off yet that is not sufficient for the\ placing of colours against each other on suitable grounds and contrast in the\ objects whether moveable or immoveable is of great consequence and decorum and although we have handled these things at large in the book of colouring yet\ we find it necessary to recapitulate them here with respect to portraits and the\ retiring grounds or vistos behind them.\ observe then whether fair and beautiful face will become light grey or\ lightifh blue ground and whether warm complexion and strong colouring against glowing or yellowisn ground will please the eye speak of the face not the draperies though both together make portrait but let the fair\ and beautiful face of woman be placed against warm ground and then the\ light parts will not only be thereby flung off and look more agreeable but the\ shades will also be softened and appear more tender for it is unnatural to force\ fair and tender virgin who shews little or no motion out of her seeming apart-\ ment- as some by their glowing shades and reflexions have endeavoured to do whereby their faces on the shaded side look as if lighted candle stood behind\ them which penetrated their skin this is as unnatural in the open air as with-\ in doors.\ this example of woman is enough to prove the contrary conduct with re-\ spect to man\'92 face according to the aforesaid rules touching the disposition\ and placing of colours on suitable grounds namely that the strong ought to be\ painted against the weak and the weak against the glowing and strong wherein\ is also comprehended light against dark and dark against light.\ whence it is evident that back-grounds contribute very much to the charm-\ ing grace of objects nay dare say that the decorum mostly depends there-\ on and though many imagine that dark or black ground always becomes portrait yet it is no rule since as before has been said each individual colour\ of the objects requires particular back-ground besides if such things were to\ be taken for rules the art would smell too much of an handicraft for dark\ colour against dark ground can have no good effect and that of white or pale\ against it will be too hard therefore medium must be judicioussy observed in\ both that one colour may suit with the other in the draperies the conduct is\ the same one person best becomes light and another dark cloaths blue suits\ one and red yellow or green another the artist must then take care not\ to force nature but help her as much as posfible and represent her always most\ beautiful.\ if any one would know my reason for thinking that many errors arise in this\ part of the art it is that the colours of the naked receive more or less or too\ much force by the by-colours of grounds and back-ornaments it fares with\ them as it is said of the camelion who changes his colour as often as he is pla\'ac\ ced by different colours though this is occasioned by his elegant and shining\ scales when contrarily the human skin is dull and not shining however we\ shall find that he who paints portrait twice and each time on contrary\ ground yet with the same temperament of colours will perceive very great nay incredible difference as have on several occasions experimented in the\ life to wit that when some virgins were in room hung with yellow they look-\ ed sickly and grey notwithstanding their fresh colour but contrarily being in\ room hung with violet their colours shewed themselves very beautiful whence\ it appears that the alterations are oftentimes occasioned by the adjacent objects.\ let him who doubts this make trial of it in portrait by laying ground with\ water-colours on paper and after the face is cut out placing it against the pic-\ ture instead of back-ground but think there is convenient way of pre-\ venting the aforesaid alteration namely by fixing against the wall behind the\ sitter garment cloth or something else of the same colour or near it which\ we chuse for our back-ground thus we may be sure of hitting the right colour and make the painting look agreeable.\ in order to represent an extensive back-ground and chiesly in small picture be it an apartment or landscape some shadiness should be contrived between the\ figure and the distance as column curtain body of tree vase these\ objects being in shade or of dark colour the lights falling on the off-works\ will not prejudice either the face or drapery though both be light but on the\ contrary the figure as receiving the foremost and greatest light will thereby be\ relieved and look more agreeable.\ as for the draperies fince they confift of different and various colours each\ of particular nature and littie agreeing with the colour of the face they also\ require each \'e0 particular ground beft suiting and uniting with it to the end\ that though differing among themselves they may have perfect harmony with\ each other so that the eye be not taken alone with the face or the draperies or-\ naments or by-works but by this sweet conjunction insenfibly conducted all\ over the picture.\ it will not be improper to treat also about easiness and sedateness in posture opposed to stir and bustle and the contrary namely that the picture of gentlewoman of repute who in grave and sedate manner turns towards that of\ her husband hanging near it gets great decorum by moving and stirring hind-\ works whether by means of waving trees or crossing architecture of ftone or\ wood or any thing else that the master thinks will best contrast or oppose the\ sedate posture of his principal figure and because these are things of conse-\ quence and may not be plainly apprehended by every one shall explain my-\ felf by examples in plate lvii touching the elegance and harmony of back-\ grounds with the figures.\ in no reprefent beautiful face against the light of the ground and\ the drapery which is white or of light colouring against the dark of it these\ oppofitions thus meeting produce sweet mixture above and below an agreeable\ relief or rising of the under part of the body whereas were it otherwise the\ face as but small part of the body would look too fharp and disagreeable and the under part of the body would have no force.\ in no being the portrait of man of more warm and swarthy complexion we see the reverse of the former because his colour and that of his dress are\ of different nature yet the ground is very ornamental and each sets off the\ no shews man with drunken face of red purple and violet and some-\ what brown and darkisn which is set off by white marble or light stone ground and gives it fine air.\ in no is an example of the contrast in off-works with the drapery of the\ figure shewing the opposition of moveable objects with fixed ones for herein\ are seen rounding and crossing folds against straight and parallel off-works and in no appears the reverse where the folds hang straight and mostly dovn-\ wards and the off-works crofs them.\ no gives us an example of the opposing action and posture of bodies in two\ fellow-portraits for the man being on the woman\'92 right side turns his face\ sideways towards her his body is fronting receiving the light from the right\ side.\ in ne we see the contrary in the woman\'92 posture her face is fore-right and her body sways sideways towards the man she also is lighted from the right\ side.\ the figures numbered and represent also yet in different manner the\ contrast in the motion for the woman standing on the right side of the man has\ has sedate motion and set and hanging shoulders but the man contrarily is\ in active motion and no shews proper method to exhibit great extent or seemingly such in\ small piece for the figure stands in strong light the by-ornaments viz.\ curtain vase pillar and walling are in shade and the off-scape or hind-work is-\ light again but somewhat broke by reason of its distance.\ to conclude this chapter ishall say something of the placing of portraits and of their point of sight.\ as to the former it is certain that when we see any painted figure or object in-\ place where the life can be expected as standing on the ground leaning over\ balcony or ballustrade or out at window it deceives the eye and by being\ seen unawares causes sometimes pleasing mistake as it frightens and surprises\ others when they meet with it unexpectedly at such places as aforesaid and\ where there is likelihood for it if we are thus misled by representation of\ nature how great must the master be who did it the knowing esteem him ig-\ norants cry him up if this be the case we ought to endeavour to follow nature\ and likelihood and principally to observe the rules of perspective for who can-\ doubt that standing sitting or moving figure artfully painted and placed as aforesaid will not have the same effect as the life itself hence it follows that low horizons or points of sights are the best and most.\ natural in portrait and will most deceive the senses if the light and distance with respect to the place where the picture is to be set be well observed other-\ wise the effect will be contrary to what we expect.\ this conduct is chiesly necessary in portraits hanging high for being so much\ above the eye they must needs have low horizon but as portraits are move-\ able how natural and like soever they be and well handled if they hang not in.\ proper places they will not have good effect hence the mischief attending them.\ is that by continually changing their places they can not always be painted\ to certain height and distance and consequently baffle our rule difficulty\ which the greatest masters must struggle with and this branch of the art is\ liable to.\ having now shewn that low horizon and point of-sight are best and most na-\ tural as supplying in some measure this inconveniency how much must they\ mistake who always chuse anhigh horizon they are on level with the sitter and yet place the horizon manyfeet higher nay they think those who do other-\ wise act against nature and art some will have two points of sight in one piece one for the figure another for the ornaments one level with the eye and the\ other for the off-scape one hand higher or lower at pleasure or about three or\ four fingers breadth above the middle although these are inexcusable errors yet\ think it vain to attempt their redress but hope the judicious artist will weigh\ what ihave said and endeavour to avoid them.\ chap of portraits in little.\ there are many things as have formerly shewed which if we will have them transport the senses by their natural representation we must always\ exhibit in their natural proportion and force of colouring but in portrait it is\ otherwise for this may as well be done in little as in full proportion provided\ the diminution be well observed and besides it has some relation to historical\ management we could say the same of little flower compared with great\ one for if it were coloured in proportion to its distance and diminution it-would\ be in the same case with portrait in little but it is nevertheless certain that in\ festoons garlands flower-pots in niches groups of flowers serving for\ ornament of chambers little slowers are of small account nay never seen wove\ or embroidered in any stuff whence some may be induced to think that por-\ trait in little as big as the palm\'92of the hand has as little property in square\ against the wall especially when it receives its light from without the frame and\ is handled with as much force as the life itself which with respect to force ial\ low nevertheless small portrait may in order to make it look more natural be more easily helped than small flowers placed against door window or other\ flat which in my opinion can in no wise be made good but small portrait\ may as shall prove in what follows in order to which the artist must previously\ consider.\ first how much the life in proportion diminishes and consequently how\ faint it must be.\ secondly that the picture can not receive its light from without the frame as\ being too far from it.\ here perhaps it may be afked whether portrait of lady or gentleman\ leaning out at window in the manner of old mieris mezzu vonder neer and\ others would not be good and natural say yes but then the window\ must also go back for as it would be difficult to represent its- going back from\ the frame since no object whether ceiling-or sloor is between them in\ order to create distance and make the picture fall back something may be intro-\ duced in full proportion to shew the depth and distance according to the differ-\ ence to be seen in the following instances in plate lviii.\ in no we see common fault in the figure leaning on aframe in this there\ is no other way to make the figure go baek than by taking away the frame and although no shews itself within the frame yet it would be to no purpose did we\ not assign sufficient large breadth or thickness to the frame for in such case we\ must not regard an hand\'92 breadth of cloth whereon to repiresent something in full\ proportion as an orange flute book yet no shews good method and in my judgment the best and most natural.\ remember :\ remember amongst the paintings of certain lover to have seen one of doctor with an urinal in his hand thrusting his arm out at window so that the\ shade of it and the glitter of the water plainly appeared on the sill of the window.\ next the window maid-servant was seen standing at the door speaking to woman in the street with child in her arins some other figures appeared in the\ front of the picture seen to the shoulders only as if standing in the street on\ the sill of the window were lying bottom of blue worsted stuck with needles also pair of sciffors piece of dark blue cloth and thimble all in full pro\'ac\ portion to be short this picture was by an artist with the owner\'92 leave sen-\ tenced to be docked in order to which he drew square chalk-line round the\ window which contained the doctor and cut away all the rest round about it hitting here an head there an arm without sparing any body but the doctor who was instantly put into smaller frame thus the piece was half cut away and for noother reason as the artist pretended than that the doctor alone was\ sufficient to satisfy the eye the rest being superfluous wretched fate for so\ good alpicture but some painters will keep the old road because it is difficult\ to correct rooted evil they do as the old woman did who being exhorted in\ her last sickness to embrace the true faith answered ce she would follow the steps\ of her fore-fathers were they all gone to the devil it is with portrait in little which has nothing of nature but the features and looks like puppet whereas there are well-known methods to make it appear\ as big as the life nay to move and speak as may say but being slighted the figure seems immoveable dumb and little and therefore unnatural.\ on this footing imean to shew that all things may be naturally represented\ in little except moon-light which baffles all our fkill.\ now if itbe afked whether too nice an expression of parts in small portrait would not be superfluous and unnatural with respect to distance and whether less\ finishing would not be better say no provided it be not so strong and warm\ as the life for the figure not being exhibited in open field it can not have so much\ mistiness and vapour about it and therefore the neat pencilling can not be ob-\ structive especially if managed with sxill as the principal parts well touched and the tender and melting smallness in the broad parts the same so that at the\ proper distance the one is seen more and the other less.\ here may arise another question whether such pictures are not of the same\ nature with what is seen through prospective-glass since every thing appears so\ plain elaborate and neat \'e0 but answer that they are not nor can because\ the glafs exhibits the life without the interpofition or mistiness or vapours and\ with strong and warm shades which overcome its smallness.\ have often wondered at such small paintings because they seemed as if was\ looking in nuremberg looking-glass or through prospective since they appeared\ not like the life but little moving puppets.\ now another difficulty is that since such paintings can not according to our\ position be made good without the addition of some by-ornament as imagery in\ whole or half figures vine-branches about the frame or something lying on it in\ order to fling them off it would be hard for those who can only paint whole or\ half\ half length figure and aim at nothing else than to become masters therein where-\ as he who is better versed may by due observance of what has been said easily\ overcome the before-mentioned difficulties.\ chap vi of the application of requisites with respect to the different\ conditions of persons.\ will not be foreign to our main design to put the artist in mind of the appli\'ac\ cation and right use of such materials as may enrich portrait and make it\ look the more noble this is so great point in portraiture that when well\ known we need never be at \'e0 stand through the mishape or defects we often\ meet with in the disposition of portrait and which sometimes must not be hid since we have often means enough for obviating them with seeming reason and\ without foreing nature as long and narrow face may be helped by hood or\ other head-dress thick and too round face by the contrary figure too\ lonesome may be embellished with pillar pedestal slower-pot table and such\ things as are proper to it which serve nor only for ornament and grandeur but\ also to express the sitter\'92 lustre and virtue but care must be taken that the figure\ of the sitter as the principal object of the piece sill up the major part of it either\ by spreading sway of the posture or by the addition of some proper by-work by which means it will have good effect.\ since it is certainthat the vices as well as virtues have two powerful qualities and though contrary to each other yet both tend to good purpose nay wicked\ person may by virtuous example be rescued from evil and virtuous per-\ son through bad example led into error and ruin but virtue being joined to vir-\ tue fears no evil contrarily the evil will make us avoid evil so pictures\ should create an ardour for virtue and especially those of religious and good\ persons since this as we have said in chap gave the first rise to their repre-\ sentations in order to perpetuate their memories as well as their virtues and\ glorious actions.\ to come then the better to this excellent point let us by noble by-works make\ them with their persons in conspicuous manner wherefore shall lay down\ some examples though drawn from heathen story.\ among the heathens some were so virtuously endowed that they need not yield\ to christanity itself lucretia and penelope in chastity cato in steadiness and cou-\ rage and many others whom we shall for brevity omit to pass to the sketching\ chamber or other apartment and an example of chaste virgin shall be that of\ lucretia it is said to her honour that she was descended of noble family and so virtuously educated that she delighted only in that now whether we\ represent\ represent her living or dead in that character we may adorn her apartment with\ sine tapestries statues and pictures in the pictures the history of penelope at work the fable of cronis and neprune some modest emblems of gods all relating to\ chastity and honour it statues or houschold goods be necessary let them be\ pallas diana hymen and especially vesta her bed may be ornamented with\ chastity and stedfastness and on her couch may be seen some cupids lighting\ each others torches or playing with palm-branches and olive-leaves the apart-\ ment may be here and there furnissied with gold and silver vases cups and other\ house-plate wrought with virtuous significations but herein care must be taken\ not to introduce any thing foreign to the matter or against history which ought\ to be consulted.\ the handling this example may sufficiently usher in the method of treating\ others such as of julius casar augustus marcus aurelius crasus solon seneca and contrarily the stories of sardanapalus semiramis faustina phalaris .\ as for cruel prince or tyrant either in his court apartment or other place even in his revels each requires its proper embellishinent the apartment\ may be adorned with paintings of all sorts of punishiments and cruelties drawn\ from the blackest parts of history together with those who cause them to be in-\ flicted if it be nero let all or some of the cruelties of his bloody reign be painted and his qualities with emblems in marble bas relicf his statues are deities or\ household gods as mars and meg\'e6ra he himself may be represented on pe-\ destal with thunder in his hand the world under his feet and the roman senators\ bowing and kneeling before him fettered like slaves his drinking equipage may\ be ornamented with noxious animals as ferpents adders and the like his chair\ or seat with tygers lyons and dragons wrought in silver gold and ivory his\ throne may be supported by jupiter juno neptune and pluto the floor curiously\ and richly inlaid with celestial sphere of lapis lazuli and the meteors and\ constellations wrought in bright gold the censers may smoak in all corners of\ the apartment but chiesly about his statue if the scene lie in his dining room the household gods may be seen thrown down in all corners especially the simula-\ crum of roma with its head broken off and lying near it jupiter apollo and vesta\ are principals in this companv in fine every thing that can denote wicked\ man or monster art must exhibit the same character should also appear in the\ actions looks and dresses of his retinue or guards for we usually say et like\ master like man.\ but not to dwell too long with princes we shall also speak of other characters and shew what suits them.\ with burgomaster suits the statue of justice and in paintings or hangings some emblems of it representing the rewards of the good and punishment of the\ bad the fasces or rods and ax are the true token of consul or burgomaster.\ with senator agree the statue of policy or government and in paintings or\ hangings some representations of the laws besides prudence and care for the\ state.\ with secretary the statue of harpocrates and in tapestry or bas relief the\ story of alexander shutting hephestien\'92 mouth with\'92 seal-ring also the emblem of\ fidelity or goose with stone in its bill.\ with\ with director governor of the east-idia company the figure or statue of it to wit an heroine with scollop of mother of pearl on her head in the nature of\ an helmet and thereon coral branch breast ornament of scales pearls and\ corals about her neck bulkins on her legs with- two dolphins conjoined head to\ head adorned with s\'e9a-shells two large thells oh her shoulders \'e0 trident in her\ hand and her cloathing long mantle landscape behind her of an indian pros-\ pect with palm and cocoa-trees some figures-of blacks and elephant\'92-teeth-\ this figure also suits an admiral or commander at sea when sea-fight is in-\ troduced instead of landscape.\ withe divine agrees the statue of truth represented in christian-like manner or else this same emblem in one of his-hands and his other on his breast besides\ tapestries bafs reliefs or paintings and some christian emblems of the true faith and representatinn of the old and new testament and in the off-scape temple.\ with philosopher celestial globe the statue of nature and representation-\ of the four elements .\ general should have white staff in his hand and the figure of mars in niche if landscape be seen trophy may be reared with victory sitting on it he may have hercules for \'e0 statue.\ with ae sea-insurer suits arion on dolphin and in picture \'e0 sea-haven\ with ship under sail making towards is on the shore the nigure of forlune and\ over the cargoe castor and pollux.\ with steersman suits the figure of precaution besides compass and in picture the four cardinal points.\ with an engineer the figure of industry besides map of military\ architecture.\ with an orator or speaker the figure of elequence or mercury without his\ purse and besides him roll of papers in the off-scape person mounted on stone and surrounded with an attentive audience.\ with virtuous young man the figure of virtue and on wall horace\'92 em-\ blem of the young man in the stadium or course or else the young hercules stand-\ ing between virtue and vice.\ some thingsare also proper to women to betoken their virtues and qualities .\ as by an imminent woman for reputation-the statue of honour and by it some em-\ blems of fidelity especially oeconomy or family government and some medals\ relating thereto.\ with widows agrees well the figure of humility or emblems tending towards.\ as also perseverance.\ it with young and sober virgin suits the figure of neatness an embroidering\ frame and its furniture besides emblems relating to it among which that of-\ business shunning idlenefs pride and gluttony have principal place.\ chap vii of the saiting of colours in draperiex.\ he\'92 suiting of colours in-portraits c\'f4mes now before us \'e0 matten\ of as great ionsequence as the former and deserves no less\ attention.\ many think though without ground that deep red best becomes red-faced\ person deep yellow fallow one and all pale colours pale one and what is\ strange black and dark colours swarthy persou but this must be rediculous\ and without reason if we confider what strange erdonnance thefe people would\ make truly if the art were so there would be no difficulty in finding agree-\ ablenefs and every one would be able to dispose it as it obght to be and if this\ were becomingness variety would be no art nay the fafhiion itself which\ alters four times year with respect to colour would not be allowed every body to\ wear as in fpring green in summer yellow in autumn red and in winter fillemot yellow or fallow-faced persons durst not wear red or red-faced ones green but enongh of this let us now return to what sober art dictates.\ beginning with the head and its hair say that deep or strong colours such\ as deep red deep yellow deep blue best fit person who has brown hair.\ those who have fair hair beft become half or weak colours such as purple lightblue violet green and rose-colour.\ yellow-haired person best becomes violet blue and whitissi yellow as masti-\ cot and\'92such like these are the chief colours which know but here we must\ observe that the lighter the hair the more weak the drapery and the darker\ the hair the stronger the drefs.\ he is prudent master who well knows how to express in his pictures the dif-\ ferent naturez and complexions of people and to distinguish persons full of fpirit\ and fire from the meek and dead-hearted the sickly and weak from the healthy\ and strong as to whom we may use draperies of the following colours with the\ red or firey fuit best draperies of half or broken colours with little red in them the pale suits no yellow or other pale colour the fallow the same but white is\ very agreeable brown complexions become not dark or strong but white and\ all light colours the blacks love white above any colour and think no dress\ better beconses them than light coloured one and not without reason for would not black man with black or dark cloaths be frightful to look at and\ how ridiculous it is for pale virgin to dress in all sorts of light and pa\'efe-colours in order to look less pale and that one who is red wear nothing bat red for the\ same re\'e2son hereby mstead ofhiding small fault the mafter would commit\ greater and yet this is the common notion but if may give my opinion red and fiery faced person dressed in red seems to me like red painted statue and pale looking person in light or yellow dress as sick or dead wherefore if we would be artful we must manage otherwise to wit that those whom we\ would\ would represent healthy or fickly ought to appear such by contrary colours as lively colours for sick or unhealthy person and weak and faintonesfora healthy\ person yet let me not be here misunderstood say not this as positive jlaw without exception but as an hint to tyros the more experienced know what\ the art teaches for she is not deficient but as the drapery sometimes over-rules so we can manage the naked accordingly for instancc red drapery requires middling carnation between pale and red so also it ought to be with pale\ tcolour when say the decorum consists in an opposition it must be understood tghat oppofition has its degrees which we ought to know and use according to\ tghe different occafion and\'92the grounds -against which they happen to come but\ in general terms the naked must always seem to be of distinct nature from the\ draperies.\ ich ap viii 'of the fnitation of great masters in painting portraits .\ and of copying their pictures in general.\ re twe leave the subject of portraiture tthink tliis head necessary to be\ treated of and therefore shall shew how far and in what mannery we may\ engage in it and subjoin somewhat of copying pictures in the same bigness as\ rwell as in diff\'e8rent flzes.\ find that this imitation of masters is less observed in their design and ordon-\ nance than in the colouring lights and shades this is certainly principal point\ tin aepicture because there can be no decorum without it nay we find some\ works of smadll masters in this particular tolerably successful though they-know\ rmot how they got- the ikrmwledge it happening mostly by chance they are\ oharmed with\'92 some fine- and taking colours in this or that great master these they\ use at-random in their own productions either forwards or in the- depth middle\ an sides hand iftthey happen to be paced against proper ground or are set off by\ any aiding by-colour the work hits right in satisfying both the eye and rules\ of art but if these fine colours happen to suit the grounds then all is wrong and\ the artist at stand..\ to explain this point we shall be more particular and clear it by examples though lthink ihave already in this hook spoken largely enough of it in treating\ of back-grounds and the harmony of colours in portrait certain artist having\ seen very beautiful white and green lace on young lady\'92 gown painted by great master he must by all means imitate it but being afked whether he had\ taken due notice of the ground-colour of the gown phe answered no how then\ oan this finetand becaming lace have good effect in his-works unless by chance the roafon of swhich is think that-either through-sshame orepride or both the\ fartist takes\'92 something from great master for instance what he used in the loin-\ tain the other that it may not be known brings forward and what he has repre-\ sented iin the open air the other contrives in dark rogm poor method of\ concealment since by right application the theft wquld be lawfull but it is such\ mens misfortune to be in this particular mostiout of the way when they think they\ do best for wanting the great master\'92 wit judgment and apprehension they\ have no true notion of his conduct and therefore are easily msled like asop\'92\ ravan cxposed to censure-\ since it is an undoubted truth that we can perform nothing but what passes\ through thought and of which cither by feeing or hearing we get an idea therefore must the paintings drawings and fine prints of old masters give an\ handle to thoughts and practice for he who never saw lion can never paint him\ well unless by the help of draught or model as was the case of certam\ westphalian who representing daniel in the lion\'92 den and having never seen lion he painted hogs instead of lions and wrote underneath these should be lions be\ this fable or truth it however teaches us that we can not represent any thing whereof we have no idea nay if we have seen the objects and made no sketches\ or models of them we shall never exhibit them naturally since memory is but\ the repofitory of knowlege and thoughts from which they draw the things which\ judgment esteems useful and servigeable.\ am of opinion that two great advantages arise from copying great masters\ works the one is that therein we see many defects of simple nature corrected by\ their skill and judgment and \'e9he other that by this means we accustom ourselves\ to rectify those defects when we have nature before \'fbs truly two points of great\ importance.\ but alas is an artist considered in his natural inclnation otherwise than child which advancing in age follows its impulse \'e0 if he perform one praise-\ worthy act how many errors will he contrarily commitp but when this bent is\ conducted by reason and art the perceptions of the mind will then as through clear channel flow pure and undefiled which leads me in some measure to con\'ac\ fess that art and practice have great advantages and are more to be set by than\ all we receive from nature which is often defective in desired perfection in single object but she is perfect in her performances and objects in general and in that sense art is obliged to follow-her wherefore with the philosopher must say of artists natura incipit ars dirigit experientia docet.\ that is nature points out the way which arts improve and settled practice makes picture move.\ hence we may easily perceive what we should do to cure this great defect of\ tke mis-use of other mens works but that may be the better understood ishall\ insist on further means for doing it if then it happen that the artist meet with\ any thing which is very taking and he be desirous to make it his own whether\ fine colours drapery stone let him take notes in his pocket-book of the\ ground ground by-colours and other incidents as what there is about such or such colour and against what ground and whether it be strong or weak and of what colour\ the objects be and wherherjthe warm or weak colour be in the distance or for-\ wards disagreeing or not as in the chapter of the harmony of colours is shew-\ ed we must also consider whether the-light come from open air or fall into\ room through glass windows as is more largely taught in the book of lights\ and shades and which repeatihere becquse think face-painters fr\'e8quently act\ contrarily in seeing afaint y\'eat sine drapery represented without-doors which with\ the same tint they exhibit in an open air.\ the like heedless mistake we see in the copies of manydisciples and young\ masters after old or modern paintings for not observing whether in lessening\ their copies which they generally do they should not also abate the strength\ of colour and tints their colouring as well in light as shade is as strong as the\ original the same error they commit in painting great copy after small\ original but this ill conduct is owing chiefly to masters when they set their pu-\ pils to copy in different size in not admonisning them of it but rather desiring\ that they shall imitate every thing as exactly as possible thought in fact it be\ against the rule of art it is therefore certain that picture with figures of\ landscape suppose it as big as the life to be copied third less in size tints in\ the copy must needs be third fainter than the original and the more it lessens\ in size the fainter the tints or else it can not be good if this conduct be of\ such moment in copying pictures of how much greater consequence must it be when portrait-painter diminisnes the life or paints portrait in full proportion\ from small one with respect to the weakening ro strengthening of colours.\ although it is commendable to follow great masters in general yet it is fault\ to dwell upon some of their particulars as an ornament urn vase term with-\ out striving at something new we think that what they have done is enough\ for our practice but this is weakness since art and nature have such fund of\ objects and our time for learning and living is long enough and by consulting\ within ourselves we may spur pur genius.\ others commit the same fault by contray impulse for so violent is their in-\ clination to some particular great master in his objects colouring that they\ think it lost time to employ their thoughts on the works of any other good artist and being thus wedded to him they wishi drudge and plod to be like him as well\ in errors as perfections by this means and by punctual imitation of blunders\ and mistakes it sometimes happens that the copy and the original are not to be\ distinguisned both being so wounderfully like each other nay their own pro-\ ductions are taken for copies for tyro of good ability may at first use him-\ self to good manner of designing which he ought to be master of before he\ takes to painting and to understand this well before he proceeds to ordonnances and then if he have thorough knowledge of the latter he will paint good\ picture yet it is often seen tnat his work is but taken for that of pupil nay\ worse than copy and what is still lefs it is not like his own manner or hand-\ ling and why such artists being advanced thus far endeavouring to produce\ their\ their gun inventions no longer minding grounds and rules but ftriving only\ at novelties care little for painting or defigning well whence their works are\ oftentimes indifferently designed poorly handled and coloured but well ordered\'92 arising only from neglect of their master\'92 instructions and what they know\ and an itch for what they still want to know whereby they are often shipwreck-\ ed between both pernicious effect of the bent of our youth which can not be\ remedied otherwise than by returning to original principles and their putting in\ use for as by an \'e8xcess in loading weight upon weight on weak and un-\ settled though well-laid foundation the whole building may tumble even the\ foundation may dance so must our practice always have an eye to theory that the custom which as we say is second nature in goodnefs as well as\ badness may gain firi footing on us and be our furest guide.\ the art of painting\ viii.\ book\ of archetecture.\ chap of archit\'e9cture in general.\ after having handlad sol many diffegent parts of the art we meet\ also with architecure an art full of noble performances and fine usez\ but our purpose is not to insist on all its advantages or give system\ of it since such work would be too tedious and calls for homer\ or virgil\'92 eloquence and having been copioussy handled by several\ learned pens we shall treat noffurther of it than what concerns painter leaving\ the rest to architects.\ an ingenious history painter if he would be universal must needs understand\ architecture and statuarry because he will otherwise be at nonplus in some\ things he ought even to be as knowing as an architect and how to order good\ building though it is an architect\'92 daily practice and \'92ghat but part of the\ painter\'92.\ it is certain that the human body is in its symmetry proportion majesty\ and grace the most perfect pi\'e9ce of work in the creation architecture is no less\ perfc\'e9t in its \'f4perations it has even preduced ghe first wonder of the world and\ thereby obtaied the laurel and palm of fame.\ writers say that babylonians were the first and after them the agyptians greeks\ and romans who brought it to perfection until in the emperor augustus\'92 time it\ arrived\ arrived at its-highest pitch but sunk afterwards by the irruption and barbarity\ of the goths vandals hunns and longobards who burned and destroyed all\ before them true proof that nothing in the world is permanent and\ stable but to come to our purpose we must \'92premise that the word architec-\ ture simply signifies draughts or designs after which building is carried\ up and constructed and comprehends the five following orders namely the tuscan doric lonic roman and corinthian according to which all buil-\ dings are regulated whether palaces tomples town-houses triumphal arches bagnios theatres town-gates galleries tombs and other-magpificent buil-\ dings round or square or both speak of their outward construction.\ the word order is of large extent but in architecture is as vitruvius\ defines it joining of different proportionate and symmetric parts as pe-\ destals columns andjtheir ornaments in such manner as to compose perfect\ order and body.\ as for the entablatures over columns to wit architraves frizes and cor-\ nices which for their richnefs have got the name of ornaments they may\ as little as the orders themselves be gither mixed among one another or\ changed from one order to another.\ careful painter will not only distinguisn one sort from another from\ cornice to base but will also take care not to put an lonic moulding on\ doric pedestal corinthian on tuscan roman cornice on an loni\'e9\ frize .\ further it is certain that the orders do not promiscuoussy suit all sorts-\ of buildings but ought so to be applied respecting their parts and orna-\ ments which also differ in general from each other as to have an har-\ mony and agreement with the whole buildings with respect to their situa-\ tion and quality.\ these orders must be enriched in their several kinds to fhiew suitable\ decorum especially the capitals except the tuscan which iis- throughout\ plain and simple.\ the doric order excells in its triglyphs and metopes the jonic in its\ valures medillions the roman in the elegance of cornices and beauty\ of capitals with their volutes and oak-leaves and the corixthiaa by its\ mouldings of victorious olive leaves and its- excelleat and agreeable\ capitals.\ the metopes in the doric frize imay be-enriched according to-the qualities\ and uses of buildings whether temples town-houses honourary arches or courts\ for priests.\ in the first suit best carved challices books wases mitres in the second the coats of arms of the republic or chief men in the governt\ ment also the rays and thunders of jupiter tied together or the caduces staff of mercury twined with serpents as denoting peace-\ in the third various arma and trophies taken from the enemy or all\ forts of mufical and warlike instruments as usual in triumphs and armies huddle-\ ed together and in the last suit best carved ox-sculls adorned with garlands betokening sacrifice\ which the ancients made to their deities oftentimes the utensils of those offerings\ were introduced to wit altar vases three legged kettles vinegar-cups censers candtesticks basons dishies hammers axes knives .\ among the works of the ancients we see in the frizes of the lonic roman and\ crinthian orders especially in the two last some foliage of cak lcaves which\ has fine effect when twined with shrubs and vine branches interspersed with\ roses and other flowers sometimes are introduced vizards with playing children\ and running animals also festoons of fruit leaves and various kinds of the most\ beautiful and agreeable flowers these tied together look nobly especially when\ judicioussy placed but enough of this he wno would know more sorts of frizal\ ornaments must consult the works of the ancients in which he will find.\ them though the before-mentioned are the principal and most in use.\ although the ancients teach that the fronts of buildings which are the parts\ most in view ought to be more adorned than the flanks and rears yet some mo-\ dern masters have misunderstood this and apprehended as if in those parts the\ ornaments could not be too many nay they have crowded the mouldings of the\ architrave frize and cornice and of the pedestals under columns with small\ carving in such manner that it rather causes confusion than ornament as ap-\ pears by their works but when used in moderation and between tbe principal\ ornaments part is left plain and blank it causes grandeur and decorum.\ something is also to be remarked about pediments and key-stones pediments\ or tops of fronts like the forehead of man snew the principal aspect of build-\ ings especially when their spandrells or faces are agreeably enriched by good\ masters with histories sacrifices arms or the like in marble according to the\ quality of the fabric.\ sometimes also are put over pediments trophies coats of arms or shields which if well cut and placed have noble effect.\ as for key-stones of arches over gates and niches these may be en-\ riched in the tuscan order with wild beasts and between heads of cyclops or\ giants.\ inthe doric order with lions heads or hercules with his lion\'92 skin over his\ head.\ in the lonic order with tame beasts or heads of pallas or amazons with their\ head attire.\ there is lurge collection of them in langley\'92 ancient masonry lately published.\ in the roman order with heads of demi-gods as ronndas jiliks casar and\ such heroes and richly wrought.\ chap ii of the rises of the ornaments columns and their\ pedestals.\ aving spoken in the former chapter of the decoration of the orders we shall now in brief manner treat of the rifes and divifions of the\ columns with their ornaments and pedestals.\ the ornament or entablature of the tuscau column rises one mod\'fble and\ seven-eight parts of module by module is meant throughout the orders the\ pillars diameter next above the base the column with its base and capital\ rises seven modules and half and the pedestal one module seven eights this\ being agreed the entablature and pedestal are each one fourth of the column\'92\ rise the base under the column and gapital over it are -in each in rise half module the lessening or diminution of the shaft of-the column at the neck under the capital is one fourth of module and it begins below at one fourth\ of the column\'92 rise.\ the entablature of the doric column rises two-modules and one eight the co\'ac\ lumn with its base and capital is eight modules and half and the pedestal\ two modules and two fifteenths this being fixed the entablature is one fourth and the pedestal throe and three fourths-of the column\'92 nise the base and ca-\ pital are each as in the tuscan half module the diminution at the neck of\ the shaft is one fifth of module and begins below at three parts one fourth of\ the entablature of the lonic column rises one module and three fourths the\ column with its base and capital is eight modules and three fourths and the\ pedestal twe modules and half this settled the entablature is one fifth and\ the pedestal three parts and half of the column\'92 rise but if the frize be\ carved the entablature is four parts and half of the column\'92 rise and in the\ following orders the same the capital with its volutes is little more than\ half module and the base is just half module and in the following orders\ the same the diminution at neck is one sixth of module and begins below\ at three parts and half of the column\'92 rise divided into twelve parts as afore-\ said.\ the entablature of the roman column rises one module and twelve twentieth\ parts of module the column with its base and capital is nine modules and\ three fourths the pedestal rises three modules which laid down the entabla-\ ture is one fifth and the pedestal three parts and one fourth of the column\'92\ rise rise the capital rises one fnodule and one flxth the base as before the diminu-\ tion at neck is one seventh of module and begins below at the rise of three\ parts and one fourth of the column divided as aforesaid.\ the entablature of the gorinthian column rises two modules the column with-\ its base and capital is ten modules in rise the pedestal three modules and one\ third after which the entablature is one fifth and the pedestal one third of the\ column\'92 rise the capital rises one module and one sixth the base as before the diminution at neck is one eight of module and begins below at one third of\ the column\'92 rise.\ the breadth of the tuscan and doric pedestals ought always to be equal with\ the plinths or bases of their columns and though the plinths in the three other\ orders project more at their bottoms by reason of their sweeps their pedestals\ must neverthelefs be alike perpendicular with the upper points of their plinths.\ let me here six the height of statue on pedestal placed next column since many mistake in it in right proportion it ought not to rise higher than\ two thirds of the column but then the column should not be too high or too\ low but stand on base only which is frequently continued through the build-\ ing as for pedestals they serve only to raise column and augment its orna-\ ment we ought also for elegance to take care that the figure and its pedef-\ tal be proportionate to each other because if the latter be too great or too\ small the figure would become too small or monftrous.\ in fine as all the parts of building ought to answer in proportionate dis-\ position so should the figures whether carved or painted be neither too big or\ little wherefore they must be governed by the height ef the place where they\ are to stand.\ chap iii of the property of \'e0 bailding and observations\ thereon.\ we must believe according to the evidence of writers and the tradition of tra-\ vellers that the italians have the best taste as well for architectur\'e9 as paint-\ ing and though it is certain that germany france england holland and othet\ countries have produced fine architects yet at this time they are not comparable\ to the italians whose manner which is the antique is now followed by the most\ polite nations the old taste was known by the name of the gothic as certain\ writer affirms faying ee that the gothic manner of building of the ancient ger-\ mans which at that time gave law to all other nations is quite abolishied by the\ italians nay he cries ont what magnificent and choice wonders do we not\ see in proud ltaly lofty rome especially where it seems as if nature and ant have\ mutually agreed to establisn their thrones and exert their powers in order to\ make this famous city the mistress of the world and the beauty of the universe st. peter\'92 church the vatican the rotunda and many other structures serving\ the whole world for examples and without which architecture is but confused\ mass draw yearly thousands of people and young artists thither to improve\ themselves by them for the service of their own countries so that the finest and\ newest things which we see in those countries lately built and still going for-\ ward are designed in the italian gusto wherefore it is to them that those fine\ piles the stadthouse at amsterdam the new lutheran church and divers other\ structures as well without as within the town do owe their origin and beauty.\ we are then much indebted to those great artists vitruvius serlio philibert de\ 'orme palladio cataneo leo baptista santoritio vignola scamozzi and many\ others who have enlightened the world with their works and writings and\ think that no one can be good architect who has not studied those authors the\ french acknowledge that their great improvements in this art are owing to the\ works and precepts of those excellent masters.\ we shall now speak of intire buildings so far as they serve for ornament in\ painting the goodness of building springs not merely from the aforesaid rises breadths or depths of the orders but from an apposite conjunction or bring-\ ing together of different proportionate parts into an exquisite body which by\ reason of its excellent form whether in height or breadth appears to the judg-\ ment of the knowing both admirable and beautiful especially when sitly adapted\ to the quality of the owner and has general conveniency with respect to cus-\ in its particular parts building requires firm foundation large\ and convenient stair-case spacious entrange an elegant division of-\ doors windows and other openings an mandsome frontispiece these\ kkilfully worked and judiciously disposed must needs produce sine effect.\ thus much for the outward face of building.\ if any object that decorum consists more in inward contrivance let me sup-\ pose stranger to come into town and passing through the streets he were\ asked what he thought of the buildings what answer would he make\'e0\ would he not say they were either fine or mean or would he say -\ must\ first see the in-sides and whethen the foundations be firm the apartments well\ disposed and well lighted and whether the under-ground offices be good -- this would be ridiculous it is true an house must have these properties but it\ is idle to think that therefore w\'e9 can not judge of the building by the outfide on-\ ly as if the person who is- able to give design for fabric can not also compart\ its in-side let it be afked then wherein consists good division within whe ther it is science which painters know not whether there must be fixed num-\ ber of halls and apartments of determinate form length rise and breadth and what those must be whether there must be one two or more stacks of stairs whether each room must have one chimney or two and-whether the floors must\ be wooden or stone or whether palace is for its largeness more beautiful\ than common or citizen\'92 house but waving other mens opinions we shall proceed in our purpose so far as\ eoncerns painter in these countries and no further our judgment is that the\ best proportion in- building is one third higher in rise than breadth espe-\ cially if it be covered in with compass-roof and its appertunances but if flat-\ roofed third wider than high and to be commanded by single order rising\ from bottom to top it would be improper to adorn them with statues bass-re-\ liefs festoons for such heavy and close structures without weight and\ moreover open on top are proper for an amphitheatre but not for temple or\ palace speak with respect to custom and decorum which must allways go to-\ ther since nothing is beautiful without its natural qualities the case is as woman in man\'92 habit and the contrary or water-vase adorned with an\ olive-branch and thunder or an oil-vessel with tritons and dolphins.\ in painting good building there must appear besides the architecture per-\ spective and colouring an orderly disposition producing elegance otherwise it\ is of no worth orderly disposition consists in so joining the parts that they\ mutually set off each other in pleasing variety and thereby exhibit fine piece\ of work and an agreeable figure this variety springs from the inequality of\ openings or windows whether oblongs squares circles or ovals the disposi-\ tions of these openings near and over each other are founded on reason as shall\ be explained by an example.\ we exhibit in-plate lix -temple topped with cupola or rather an house\ round-roofed on each side of the door flight of steps descend ballustraded underneath which is vault and over the entrance balcony now beginning\ from below we shall shew what figure each opening ought to have in an orderly\ disposition the door under the steps is square rising somewhat more than its\ diameter that of the entrance is circular on top and rises one third more than\ its diameter that of the balcony also rises one third more than its breadth but is\ square or flat on top and then we meet the roof rounding again now let us\ dispose it otherwise and make the door below circular the next square the next\ thus much for doors for we find no other than\ round and no roof appearing.\ round and square ones the same method may be taken with windows when\ there are two ranges one above the other the undermost may be oblong and\ the uppermost compass but lower if there be another range of windows above\ these next the roof they ought to be perfect squares this rule we have taken\ from the works of the ancients who always gave their openings or windows more\ rise in the first story than the second still lessening in the third yet all alike in\ diameter windows should never be lower than about three feet from the floor\ within if there be windows in the basement-story where the walling is thickest and is usually finished with rustic order they must be square and above ei-\ ther scheme little rounding or flat and thus the one snew the other with re-\ spect to roundness and squareness if-now there were compass-windows in the\ basement and upper stories the- uppermost should be circular and the undermost\ oval with their longest diameter parallel with the level of the building because being pressed by the weight their arch is dilated when contrarily the others\ do not bear any weight but circular windows are grown out of use as not ad-\ mitting light so well as the square ones.\ if in the piers between windows there were niches and figures in them and\ over head room for bafs relief than the table for ie must be square but circu-\ lar where it is over square window.\ as for doors over each other isay that if there were over the cornice com-\ pafs pediment and on both sides ballustrde with figures then the bal oony door\ ought not to be circular but square and ornamreated with pillasters yet the door of\ the entrance may be circular we ought even not to set on the balcony ballustrade\ with figures but ornament it with balls or other low things the one or other\ ballustrade must be also diversified for two parts alike in two such emminent\ places have an ill effect wherefore one of them should be close walled parapet-\ ways and the face of it may then be enriched with bafs reliefs of figures festoons .\ think what have said sufficient guide for the other kinds of buildings for\ these observations are on all occasions unalterable to painter with re-\ spect to agreeable disposition.\ there is still somewhat behind which though contrary to the dispofition\ aforesaid must be animadverted it is touching slower garden which if fine must needs be regular as well with respect to its general form as its particular\ division at least the two sides ought to be alike whether set off with pots vafes statues or other ornaments we are taught indeed that uniformity is stiff and\ not painter-like wherefore we thould avoid it as much as posfible but\ weighing the precept maturely we shall find the fauit to lie in dur misapprehen-\ fion of it questionless things proceeding from rul\'e9 and order must be regular but that regularity may nevertheless be somewhat hidden on occason wherefore though garden be uniform on both sides we are under no necesfity of shewing\ all that uniformity one side is sufficient the rest may be handsomely hid or\ broke with tree piece of stone work column or corner of the house but\ let us not from hence absolutely conclude regular objects to be unnecessary in an\ ordonnance for they sometimes furnisn all the decorum of picture yet if we\ see but part of them we may conceive the residue.\ more examples of breaking uniformity may be thefe when figure stands on\ each side of gate or alcove man may be placed or sit down before one of them\ in order tocreate inequality so also if by means of \'e0 curtain one of those figures\ be shaded if bafs relief be set on each side of the gate or alcove one ofthem\ may partly be covered by the personages to answer our purpose if without\ doors on both sides of an entrance there be carved lion or sphinx we may break\ of one of their heads solomon\'92 throne was adorned with twelve golden hons we\ need not see them all the fix on one side fhew sufficiently that there must be as\ many on the other two orthree entire are enough of the rest we may see only part here andthere thus we must always manage in such cafes.\ chap of the matching of the vario\'e9 coloured marbles as\ well without as within building with the management of tombs vafa and bacchanalian terms.\ bjects have \'e0 fine effect when nature and art are joined together by al\ skilful hand and though all eyes are not alike qualified to apprehend the\ it is beautiful and soought to be though the one person as say understand\ it and the other do not and forthis reason art has such power that though\ nature be beautifut in her productions yet they would not perfectly please our\ eges without the help of art.\ nature produces an infinity of fine stanes of various colours and qualities but\ art alone judges of their fitness and orderly looation as to rank and dignity inso-\ much that though ignorant in art we oan clearly apprehend that it ought to be\ so and no otherwise.\ we know that ths white is foft and tender and lovely to the eye the black\ contrarily is melancholy and disagreeahle we place then the black among the\ red and upon the red white these three coloured stones are capitals and can-\ aot be otherwise dispofed as-to th\'e9ir natufes and qualities without foreing nature and zunning counter to art.\ however their rank and application in architectonic use may be these.\ in the tustan order as undermost black marble.\ in the doric green.\ i the janic yehow.\ in the roman red and .\ in the coriathian white.\ if any afk why the ned is not set before the yellow since the red is in its nature\ daykerrthanthe yellow ianswer that it is because the red and green are op-\ posers in strength coatrarily yellout is proper to green since yellow and blue\ green.\ at any time we are obliged to place between two stones of one colour stone\ of another the following mixtures are mostly in use.\ between two black marbles suit best jasper copper or brafs.\ between two serpentine or green marble stones the same.\ between two red stones white.\ between red black or serpentine stone pisan white-eyed marble.\ between two grey stonies free-stone or yellowisn white marble.\ between two dotted long veiny stones one that is speckled aad the contrary-\ between two jaspers yellow or ffestry white marble.\ \'92marbl\'e9-painter miist observe the conveniency and place for marbling if the\ plaoe be large or an hall then he may doit with force but in smaller com-\ pafs pass he ought to moderate it and keep it faint that the place may not seem\ thereby lessened or the eye offended if the room be hung with pictures he\ should consult men of experience especially the master who painted them what\ colouring will fit best.\ about light pictures dark marble is best and about dark pictures light marble as pisan jaspar or any tending to light yellow but if it be single\ colour such as bass reliefs then free-stone suite best.\ in bringing many sorts of coloured marbles together we may for instance in\ frontispiece either single or double-colonaded and pedestrated very agreebly\ dispose them thus viz plante ix the base and pedestral-mouldings may be black little eyed the block of square of the piedestal dark red much\ dotted less veined theplinths of the columns and pilasters mey be white the columns light red or pisan marble with large white-eyed veins on both sides\ the eying to be alike the pilasters also light red moderately eyed the capitals\ white the architrave black like the base and mouldings of the pedestals the\ frize may be dark red like the blocks of squares of the pedestals and the cornice\ black again like the architrave if the frize have raised ornaments of foliage children triglyphs ox-sculls they ought to be white if over the cornice\ be parapet it may be entirely of another colour and the pedestals and the\ members of pisan or other cross-veined marble and the panels of faces of grey\ marble or white if adorned with bass reliefs the figures or vases on top also\ white.\ this distribution may be doubled and varied on occasion the frizes and co\ lumns may be white the bases and capitels gold and so may also the ornaments\ be to wit triglyphs little blocks and foliage the rest may remain as before.\ in an hall of red or other marble where the mouldings of the ornaments are\ different larger or smaller we may make door frontispiece or alcove of white\ or other marble but if the members continue along the hall \'92the frontispiece or\ alcove ought to be of the same colour with the room the room may be of one\ order and the frontspiece alcove and chimney of another thus the room may\ be lonic and the rest corinthian or roman the pavement of the floor must cor-\ respond with the building mean if the room have pillasters the bands or\ bordering marbles tying the pavement must run up to them whether the\ pilasters stand wide or close for they ought to be so laid as to shew every where\ -regularity whatever jets or breaks the door frontispiece alcove may oc-\ casion as prudent gardener disposes his parterres one round another square octangular always contriving such an uniformity as closes with the borders.\ in the middle of the hall may be introduced such figures or compartments as best\ answer the general purpose and they may be of what colour you please.\ in chambers or galleries where the sides are unlike we are obliged to part\ them by some figure coming between and yet the bands which bind the sides must come every where alike if there be columns on both fides of the gallery the bands must run croffing it from one to the other.\ proceed we now to party-coloured tombs and other stones.\ on white\ sphinxes lioneffes fuits well tomb of serpentine or porphyry and\ back plinths if no figures orother ornaments support at porphyry also looks\ well on bracketsof copper\ or brass the tomb may be of black marble with\ grave-stones or other bluish\ stope agrees well violet-colour stone or porphyry copper or brass note here that the black inust always be undermoft especial-\ ly when divers sorts of colours are placed pnone another jas we have shewed in\ the orders.\ great vases and urns are always of the fame stone as their ba\'efes as well in\ niches as on pedestals if- on pedestals the bases ought to project equal with the\ blocks precisely the priapus-terans anciently used in the bacchanalia were mostly of wood not\ very large and pointed underneath for conveniency of carriage from place to\ place whither the gang of satyrs fauni and bacchanals determined to go.\ having pitched on place for their stay they fixedit in the ground by means\ of the point aforesaid these terms were-sonretimes painted of brick colour\ sometimes also white about the mouth and breast they were smeared with blue\ grapes.\ the posts or guides called hermes were huge and immoveable and of white\ stone set on rijde heaps of stone in order to be conspicuous to travellers at dis-\ tance for which realon they were also sometimes placed on pedestals or blocks.\ chap of the veins and eyes in ston\'e9s used in architecture as\ well without as within and how to dispose them he beauty in painting buildings consists in an elegant expression of the dif-\ ference of stones which compose them and this may be effected not only\ by their-divifion but also by their colours especially in outside-work which is\ not so much heeded -as the inward and is subject to more inconveniences of\ rain hail and wind and if standing in damp places their effect in few years\ visibly appears if the stones be-not very-hard by the dropping of mouldings and\ projeckures in seyeral parts.\ fountains must be supposed to suffer much and become very mossy by being\ dropped on and so do tombs and igrave-stones but principally pyramids which\ age not set up so much for the sake of their polisned bodies as for their forms\ and huge bulk wherefore it is no great matter whether the stones of these be of\ nae fort or colour ornot they are often seen of many sorts of stones some as they\ have been fopnd and others changed through- time yet the cement suffers most by being eat ijn whereby the stones get sloose and must needs drop again some stones being more weak and brittle than others and corroded by the air dampnefs and drought are broke in pieces by the pressure of those over them and-thuis leave gaps and breaks wherein the rain gathers out of which grow\ weeds weeds mofs and other greens sometimes whole branches all iwhieh at the\ year\'92 end decay and become green sap triekling thence down\ che ftones.\ we shall here stop little to say fomething toucning abuses.\ know not hou\ some can so far relish sloveliness as to spoil not only statues and fine figures but\ also intire buildings if they were broken or mould\'e9red pieces ruins and other\ decayed stones it would be no damage if ever so much muddled and be-dropped -\ but it is very improper to serve intire and fin\'e9 figures thus and in places too\ where are neither trees or any thing else to oecanon iti the fame they do in\ buildings looking as frefh as at first were the spots seen on them natural to the\ stones it would be more proper than all the gutters ufually represented to \'92trickle\ down them wherefore care must be taken before we begin to paint things sup-\ posed to be dropped on that \'e0 difference may appear between nearnefs and dis-\ tance for as spots in cloaths are more visibl\'e9 near than -far off so the faintnefs.\ of remote objects must be obferved but let me afk what foulnefs of wet and\ dust can stick to smooth bodies which rain hail or fnow do n\'f4t wasn off but\ they may decay and be consumed by time especially those facing the north we see many inftances of decay in ancient build-\ which suffer afl extremities.\ ings where are figures so eaten un by time that it is hardly discernable whether-\ they reprefented men or women like figures of snow partly dissolvedt by tke sun-\ beams.\ speak not here so much against the dropping upon and muddling such objects .\ as of the abuse when the cause of such an effect does not appear for withoux\ probable reason why thing should be thus or thus art becomes obstinacy.\ but to return to our subject.\ it is certainly praift-worthy to take some pains in shewing the stones of\ buildings and their veining and eyeing when they are judieisusly and agree-\ ably disposed according to rule say it is commendable to him who under-\ stands perspective.\ the parts of buildings within which are not so subject zo the teeth af time are not so apt to decay as those witkout the cement ajso jasts- longer which-\ makes them keep elean and intire their joints to seem afmost iivisibie and th\'e9\ whole to be as one stone for this reason we must aveidk the miiftkkes of som\'e9\ painters who vein and eye their work and afterwards divide it intaeftones where-\ by one vein or eye happens oftentimes to run through twubr thr\'e9e stones at once .\ whence we must conclude it to be what it is meer painting and inot the life :\ whereas think it the most certain way first to divide che work inte stopes and.\ then to marble and eye them observing chat each stoue have partieilar eye t buildings have beautifil effect when the architecture is fine and well ornamented and this as well in painting as the dife rcerly dispofltion is ope of-\ the best r\'e9afons thereof without which it can not have that vaft agreeublenefs.\ knowing architect takes especial care of che setting\'92the stones of is build-\ ing in such manner as to blazon its beauty and improverit and\'92thereby cregte\ harmony wherefore he disposes the eye-veiny stones in *he prepereft manner for instance in single-colonaded porticoy\'92the veiny eyes must oppose each other sloping\ stoping from out to in contrarye the same method must be observed in \'92the\ bdafters -and al parts that are paired so that the work may appear regular at distance taklag especiadt care that they be eyed alike to keep the eye always in balance between thom the ftones for the architrave frize and cornice fhould\ he fo chofen that the weining fall perpendicalar in antter to keep the members\ distinct which they would not be were the veinr to fall in with the mouldings.\ ip remains to beobserved in marbling eolumns that the eye-veins ought to re-\ ceive the strongest light on the relieved and swelling parts in order to aid the flat\ of the picture by art wirich nature wants nor as being round of herfelf where-\ fore it would look ill that the most dark of thezeye-veins come on the weaker\ parts because it would render the effect you proposed abortive.\ imagine piece of walling divided into three pannels on each side of which\ stand two columns the two first ought to oppofe each ocher theit veming muft\ either be level or run diagonally against each other outwardly or inwardly the\ twto others most do the same and so on\ chap vi.of ruins.\ hitherto we haye fpoken of th\'e9 beauty and regularity af intire\ buildings wherefore it is proper next to treat of fraginents and ruins equally necessary with the former.\ thave sometimes wondered how-ir hapipens that among the paintprs of figures\ and landscape who make use of buildings and gther-brick-work so fow exhibit\ whole and highly fmished ones all they thew is rains broken walls and de-\ cayed stones but feldom itire and perfect ftructures becaufe as take it they will be at no trouble to fearch antiquity for the forms and most beantiful\ parts of architecture whereby they might learn to produce something curious supinity proceeding from their want of knowledge and ambition to obtain it.\ although many think that piece of ruins does not requine so great regard\ \'e0s an intire building they are much mistaken for the one as well \'92as the other\ depends on measure and proportion yet some will go and throw down part of\ \'e0 building and intermix with it some fragmenis of capitals pieces of frizes cornices and the like of an order foreign to the building which though very\ wrong they salve by suppofing that when building is in mins no one will have\ the curiosity to examins the mibbisn to see whether- zhere be wnong capital frize\ or cornice and granting such were to be fowad the fault would be nan\'e9 fince those.\ broken parts might be brought thither gafually but this is 'lame excuse \'92to speak the truth icannot apprehend how anyone can be so wilful since no naore hnow ledge\ and trouble are necefsary to the best than tthe worst things to the whole than to\ the halfs in-gh\'e9 gne we lmust use the footruule and compastes as well as in the\ other if beautiful remain of great building adorn fine landscape and\ look\ look grand how much more one in perfection he then who will take pains\ may certainly by practice overcome all diffic\'fblties if-he have ambition enqugh\ but let me not be understood to speak against the\ to- study the best things.\ choice of ruins much less endeavour to hinder any one from the ue of them since am senfible that every man has naturally particular taste for some thing\ as we have formerly said wherein he may excell.. desire not to discourage\ painters of ruins or to raise pique against that sort lof objects my only drift\ is to shew that we ought to study the rests of antiquity with care and attention and chiefly to learn the ancient state of old structures in order to know perfectly\ what they were in their best condition.\ chap vii principal directions for painting the ornaments off\ halls rooms .\ in this sort of work we must in the first place have an eye to the regu-\ larity and division of the architecture and if that be beautiful not in the\ least hurt it under pretence of decorum or acting- painterelike and if at any\ time we are obliged to alter this conduct it must nevertheless be in favour of the\ architecture.\ that the painting of what kind soever it be must tend to the lustre and\ magnificence of the building speak with respect to painting the wood-work whether it be marbled or plain.\ that the ornaments to be painted agree with shose of the room and be\ governed by the same order in architecture.\ ia\ that in pannels niches and windoms ought to be artfully painted whas\ you would have appear to be real on nattirally there whether tapestry or prospect af tapestry it must appeas to be such if view it must look like view the former by being bordered and the latter by its sky or sun every wh\'e9re agreeing\ with the light of the room-\ the master must beware of representing in room chree or more different\ hours of the day at the same time nor in histories unless they be in the mannee\ of tapestry.\ he must never inclose white marble bafs-reliefs wigh wood-work as being\ repugnant to custom and likelihood.\ lastly fince excess often abates the majesty of fabric the artist\'92should avoid\ many littlenesses in the divisions and ornaments on such occasions historical fi-\ gures should not exceed three or four feet in height be the paintiug ever so large tapestry figures exceeding the life are unjustifiable they look monstrous in fmall room and lessen larger.\ it were to be wishied that great men and lovers who bespeak such works had\ some previous knowledge of fuch things as these at leaft that they were in-\ formed of them and would asfent to the-artist\'92 opinion in the execution of them finoe it is reasonable that his design if it pleafes be followed.\ few artists are sollicitous about inside-ornaments either in reference to their\ elegance and splendor or their uies andeconvenience as is -evident in many old\ masters works wherein we generally see too great simplicity all is plain and.\ mean tables benches chairs kitchen-stuff drinking-vessels and what\ is more oftentimes company of old and young people in room with never chair in it and sometimes no more than bare walls and curtain hanging for\ no purpose orgaments and foliage are feldom seen in their works and when they are they are so improperly and disjunctively applied that we must con-\ clude them rather to serve for humour than decorum certain signs that such maf-\ ters were ignorant hoth of the naturalness needfuluefs and application of ob-\ jects.\ it is oertain that the- ancient greeks and ropaus were not originally so sumptu\'ac\ ous in their house-furniture as afterwards they came to be and it is as easy to\ think that there was -difference between the nobility and commonalty as well\ in their buildings and dress as in other zespects the one used plate at his table .\ the other earthen-ware or painted -wood the one had bals-reliefs statues hangings or tapestries-in his house the other was content with bare walls each\ according to his fancy or ability truly am surprised to think of my first\ ordonnances and how disjointed my conceptions were often exhibiting royal\ history in stable or cottage and as often the contrary questionless every maf-\ ter of an house furnishies it with what is proper for each apartment whether\ kitchen chamber state-room or gallery one apartment has bed or couch and\ its appertunances chests tables and chairs another has hangings more or less\ costly floor-carpets stands sconces looking-glasses another has benches chimney-piece circular couches fitting the table and other things proper to\ the room and thus other apartments.\ some imagine that chairs were not ancieutly in use but men sat on cushions as in the eastern countries or else rested on couches when certain person had\ represented aneas and dido in stately hall and she placed on low small half-\ pace covered with carpet with the young ascanius in her lap and aneas by her\ fide and some ladies sitting here and there on cushions on the floor which was\ covered with green ganpet was surprised to see large round table stand in\ corner on side of the painting and this serving up as for an entertainment and yet not chair nearit afked the master why the ladies had not chairs or\ benches and whether this circumstance was thus to be found in history he\ answered that in those times neither chairs or benches were known could\ hardly forbear laughing but afking him whether the company were to stand to\ their victuals because of the height of the table he began to see liis error yet\ in excuse said ee they will make use of the couch which stands vonder against\ \'bb this would have been tolerable come-off had the couch been\ the hanging.\ made for the table but by ill luck the one was square the other round said\ no more because would not augment his- blushes.\ others.\ others have made the same mistake as was the case of one who as the reoort\ goes representing abraham\'92 offering drew him with scymiter or bending\ sword in his hand and straight scabbard by his side.\ once made the fame blunder when my inclination for compofition was greater\ than my skill in the story of hercules foinning by omphale had feen in de-\ sign of bartholet that hercules was much bigger than any of the women where-\ fore also drew him larger and dreffed in wornen\'92 apparel having fleeves closed\ at hands like sardanapalus amongst his women in mervan \'92 historical chronicfe distaff in his girdle spindte in bis hand and pearls about his neck and in\ order to shew that they were omphale\'92 cloaths placed her by him stark naked.\ now appeal to any one how well the garment couid fit omphale seeing it was\ neither too short or too streight for hercules though half as tall again as fhe but\ afterwards rectified my conduct.\ it is plain that such overfights proceed from ignorance or lame instruction and principally in what concerns embelfishment say embellissiment of any\ kind whatsoever whether within or without doors for few know the importance\ of this part of art and the uncommon effects of it.\ we may from tlie works of old and judicious masters here and there bor-\ row some of their thoughts and use them in proper mamer in our own works.\ the famous pouffin in his finding of moses shews the nile with water-god and with good reason as we fhall prove in the chapter treating of the authority\ painters have to represent spiritual and manimate beings under hyman forms but it is ridiculous in my opimon that the same figure with all its adjuncts fhould be placed on the strand of river and near it narcissux viewing himself\ in the water on supposition that if it be but water-god all is well for thinks the mafter it suits well.-it is fine figure -- befides if poussin durst do\ it why may not we but it is against reason indeed were the sphinx and\ children left out it may be passable enough.\ who sets out room of entertainment and it does not shew whether the din-\ ner be over or not by the cloth laid bottles glaffes cisterns and all things in\ order as before dinner and empty bottles lying in disorder empty difhes dog gnawing bone chairs displaced table-cloth half turued up and such like after dimer or who can approve in testa\'92 dipping of aehilles thetis\'92 lymg in an open gal-\ lery where also is cradle for moveable embellishments it is improper td shew mark anthony and cleo-\ para in their grandeur and luxury without retinue and as in private colla-\ tion seeing we know they had such crowd of mufic buffoons juggiers and\ other loofe people about them or can we represent crift lying in the manger attended by joseph and marv and the three kings waiting on him and that in stable full of beast-provender and on the wall fan and stail hanging befides\ other utenfils of husbandry and yet not countryman or servant to appear or chest box saw or square to be seen xhether joseph hired the stable or found\ \'e2t void of people is another consideration moreover one of the principat\ figures\ gures is in fuit of armour and bare-headed and yet his head-piece is not to be\ feen.\ one of my fehow-disciples once painted collation and afked him why he\ put not knives on the table \'e0 he answered that knives were not aatique very\ well thought are then the bread\'92 and meat and three-legged stool wich back\ standing by antique is not improper though small circumstanee that chamber-pot be placed\ by bed-fide when person is in it even were there also at day-break lamp\ either burning or extinguished and such like things whereby we may judge what other circumstances are required.\ from all which confiderations it is plain that judicious master must take par-\ ticular thought about the by-works seeing it is as bad to leave out something\ ghat is needful as to add what is unnecessary.\ chap viie of the pictures proper to various apartments.\ xvhe nature property and use of pictures in general is to keep the senses .\ by pleafing variety of objects as figures landscape in continual\ einploy and contemplation.\ their nature has- near affinity with that of the things they reprefent when\ those are done by skilful hand and therefore they can when natural things are\ wanting fufly fatify.\ thein preperty lies in their \'92application to meet places and they can not be\ displaced without hurting nay undloing naturalnefs.\ as for the use oft pictures it is in the occasion we have for them and the\ glaoes they are to ferve for in order to-gratify the senses of the ouners they\ must be well expressed and fall in with the architecture in the agreement of the\ various objects wich the ornaments of the buldings.\ ef tkis-be uuintelligible pfhah endeavour to explain myself say then that\ it is not sufficient for painter to design work for apartments at random and\ introduve therein what fancies he pleases or best understands for he ought to.\ aonsider whether it agree with the place and be proper there if therefore he\ would go on with certainty he must in the first place consult the architecture .\ und then the three poines following.\ the quality or condition of the building the building itself.\ the aparemenes in iti.\ first let him consider whetlier the owner be prince lord magistrate or\ ierokaet.\ secondly whether the building be public as town-house church palace ..\ ar pr\'eavete as- far merchant or eitizen.\ lastly whecher ie be an hall chamber parlotrr kitchin or che like.\ thus\ thus far in general\'92 but if we bulld galaser for kiag the apartments must be\ contrived for other uses than those for merchant or even town-house for in this\ latter we find many rooms fitted for purposes oppsite to \'e0 palace as may be seen\ in that fine- model the stadt-house at amsterdant where architecture has wonder-\ fully disposed all the rooms to their several uses nor is the judgment of the pain-\ ters or architects less conspictous in the proper placing the pictures in each apart-\ ment for each piec\'e9 chiefly sculpture is so ordered as to allude tg the rooms whence we know what uses the rooms are put and by the rooms what the\ printings stone-figures and bass-reliefs signify.\ wherefore it is very necessary to consider the nature of the apartments in order\ govern our work thereby as first to\ in the hall belew fuits well gray bass-relief or else trophies painted on the\ walls after the life.\ in an antichamber where people wait for commands gray ornaments are alse\ best sometimes intermixed with slowers but very sparingly.\ in an audience or presence-room should be tapestries or pictures with figures as big as the life of magnificent transactions which happened in apartments or\ palaces.\ in the ladies visiting-room must be other sorts of embellishments such as fruit flowers landscapes sine thoughts virtuous representations and the moft cloathed\ and modest histories.\ in the nursery agree bafs-r\'e9liefs and painted emblems or morals whereby\ the children may learn good manners and\'92 inure tender years to virtuous actions to these may be added some flowers fruit birds and such like.\ in the kitchin may be seen the representations of culinary furnitute hunting\ of deer the picture of some maid-or-gther servant or dog or cat but these\ must be mostly gray or wood-colour on account of the smoke which otherwise\ would sully the colours.\ in the gallery may appear all sorts of hunting-equipage painted on the walls\ from the life.\ in thet upper-rooms suit landscape and all kinds of beautiful prospects.\ in the mafter\'92 bed-chamber are proper some beautiful faces and naked child-\ iren painted after the life.\ in the childrens bed-room nothing must be seen but foliage or bragch-work.\ the study may be adorned with paintings in gray marble of learned men philosaphers .\ in the summer-house being place for the enjoyment of company and enter-\ tainments suit nothing better than merry bacchanalian pieces sportive herdsmen dancings brooks and fountains.\ we proceed now to the decorations over chimneys and on doors in each\ apartment.\ over the dining-room chimney place comus god of meals accompanied by\ taste and smell and on the door latitia or joy.\ over the hall-chimney may be decorum or authority accompanied by pallas or virtue and hono\'92 or honour and on the door understandipg over the lady\'92 visiting-room chiinney modesty accompanied by obedience\ and diligence and on tne door fidelity.\ over the chimney in saloon or meeting-room for youth may be seen inventus or youth attended by grace and eloquence and on the door gaudium or joy.\ over the nursery chimney place education and by it young branch tied to stick and on the door obedience.\ over the kitchen chimney prudentia of prudence accompanied by ceres and\ bacchus and on the door diligence.\ over the bed-chamber chimney quiet and the door security.\ over the study or closet chimney wisdom or science and on the door harpocrates.\ on the doors of side-rooms going out of the hall clemency and vigilance and between them oeconomy.\ on the pantry-door abundance.\ on the cellar-door silenus.\ on the garret or loft-door winter.\ on the garden-door flora.\ on the orchard-door pomona.\ in the green-house between the stoves the figure of persons who have been\ transformed into trees and plants as cyparissus myrrha daphne on the door\ within apollo and on the outside diana.\ on the stable-door all sorts of stable-appertenances as bridle saddle houfing stirrups dung-fork shovel curry-comb .\ on the privy-door momus laughing.\ and now that may conceal nothing from the artists shall subjoin the pic-\ tures proper to be put into chimneys which may be various because we are\ not confined to the fire as being only used during the winter-season the spring summer and autumn afford us large field for fine inventions and since the place for three quarters of the year becomes any thing we sind proper we can either\ shut them up or leave them open or contrive in niches all sorts of statues or\ busts bass-reliefs and other ornaments as cisterns vasa flower-pots bafkets of\ fruit mufical instruments globes and such like we can have them be open with\ doors or without with one door or two half ones and represent vistos or pros-\ pects such as flower-garden public place with fountains street of houses grove lane frontispiece pantry wine-cellar an alcove with couch or li-\ brary and such like in fine we may introduce any thing that is different from\ the furniture of the apartment but care must be taken that the painting have\ natural and high horizon with little or no sky to gain more depth vistos of\ apartments one within another are also not improper but if we represent with-\ out-door-prospects as aforesaid it is more proper to paint doors seemingly to give\ the room-air and seeing it often happens that such painting can not have the\ most advantageous light and is sometimes in shade by the projecture of the chimi-\ ney we should contrive the work accordingly and so as not to appear like paint-\ ing but nature itself.\ the designs proper to such places for the fake of those who are not fertile in-\ invention may be such as follow.\ spring flora setting out with gay and joyful air has basket of spring-\ flowers under her left arm with her right hand behind she little lifts up her\ gown her left foot rests on step and her right lifts up her breast is somewhat\ to the light behind in low off-scape is seen parterre ornamented with vases behind her we may place another figure in shade ascending the steps in order to\ sling off the off-scape and bring forward the fore-figure flora must be propor-\ tioned to the size of the fire place if not as big as life let her be young damsel and if-the face be fhaded by the chimney make good advantage of the re-\ flexion the same design may be also executed with children.\ summer pomona with basket of fruit in her lap and in the off-scape an-\ orchard and some cupids busily gathering fruits and flowers.\ autumn bacchus represented in an entranee or gate-way hung round with\ vine-branches and grapes and if you please young satyn by him with cup this-design may be also represented with children-\ anteros as youth crowned with laurels stands on threffiold leaning on\ torch or else long arrow pointing inwardly to library wherein are an astrolabe\ and globe and against the wall \'e0 lyre hanging his-garment fastened\'92 on each\ shoulder is-reddish purple his look agreeable and majestic his mouth open as if complimenting somebody to come in he stands on the left side against the\ door which comes half in snhade against the off-scape so that he is strongly set\ off his face and under-parts are fronting his breast turning to the light this-\ design either left or right is equally good and so are the- before- mentioned cupid is seen here sweetly smiling having flask on his arm and spax-\ water-bottle in-his hand which- he holds up as if he were saying \'97\ rare waters by him is an elegant stand or tea-table on which another capid is placing silver\ salver with- glasses and silver sugar-box and spoon behind may be seen winc-\ cellar- lighted by candie or lamp we should also discover part of summer-\ or fountain or gallery .\ in this design we shew- serenade by three boys the first drest as punch-\ an-ello with bag-pipe hautboy or flute the second as an harlequin with vio-\ lin and the third as scaramouch with guitar and all three in their proper-\ postures harlequin in set- posture stands to the right against post holding the\ violin ta his ear punch-an-ello sieting against the other post on the threfhiold holds his flute from his mouth and looks forward laughing and shewing his teeth .\ his head finking backwards somewhat into hisneck scaramouch is in the middle with his-guitar under his arm and his head quite sunk intohis fhoulders he is\ attentive holding his fore-finger to his nose and his legs closes behind these\ buffoons we might shew balustrade aver water in shade and on it an ape sit-\ ting in the water may be gondolas with mafks in them or else \'e0 street and\ such like.\ because the breadth of the aforesaid opening- can not be very great you may by\ shutting the door more or less or by placing somewhat between it get advan-\ tageous shades if the matter require it there ought at most but afigure and half\ to\ to be in the light and third in shade the colours will effect the same.\ such\ paintings should not be inuddled but boldly handled and the lights strong.\ thus iuch for without-dodr views proceed we now to designs for \'e9himneys :\ which are closed.\ vase of white marble gold or silver or the belly gold and the neck\ and foot of lapis lazuli in niche of red marble or porphry and the jaumbs\ to be of lighter stone hung with festoons of all sorts of fine leaves interinixed\ with slowers these festoons should be very large lik\'e9 two arms and spreading in order to break the light ground that the middle-ornament whether white\ marble silver or gold may have the gr\'e9ater force.\ the bust of bacchus in white marble erowned \'e9ither with vine leaves and\ branches and grapes or else mulberries with theif greens on each side on ground of free-stone festoons of whitt and blue grapes and between those may\ be placed some proper instruments as cymbals timbrels tabors hautboys and\ pan\'92 flutes the bust is on pedestal of pisan-marble in niche as before the niche must rise as much as possible that the bust may have its full h\'e9ight but if the chimney and niche do not admit of figure in full proportion you\ may make boy of it if you leave out the pedestal you can place the same in\ the niche but third less in height under the niche may be faint bass-re-\ lief of grey or other marble or else festoon of pine leaves intermixed with\ tome beautiful flowers.\ the hust of apollo and on each side some musical instruments either\ ainted as carved or natural under the niche may be square pannel and on\ at carved torch witha quiver across through garland of laurel among the.\ some rolls of paper with geometric and other fuch figures for these can be bet-\ ter ordered in bass-relief tnan among those naturally painted.\ deep niche in which may be seen table with an elegant stand or foot\ of sine wood partly gilt on the table china tea-furniture as dishies saucers tea-pot and silver chased tea-cannister or else coffee equipage as silver cof-\ fee-pot silver salver with pipes knife some tobacco in paper fine cha-\ fing dish with fire and on the ground in the snade some bottles of wine.\ the table in this design may be put to various uses it may be served with\ melons or baskets of fruit as peaches nectarins apricocks silberds .\ on such table may be also music-books and instruments as lute violin hautboy and on the ground cistern of water with bottles of\ wine standing upright therein.\ in this last we may place round bass-relief representing sitting child of flefhi-coloured marble on blue ground blowing bubbles round it white\ marble moulding and underneath festoon.\ chap ix descriptian of several pictures adapted to the five\ orders in architecture.\ ince no manner of describing fine apartments is more proper than this which exhibits things as if we really saw them shall therein give an\ architectonic view of each order and in as conspicuous manner as myself\ conceive it the particulars must then be well regarded because they are so-\ linked together that by overlooking small circumstance the whole chain\ may be broke without ever getting true idea of the thing.\ we shall confine the subject to five apartments and describe in each the pic-\ tures which shew the nature height custom and other properties relating to-\ the orders of this building and since the tuscan order either in parts or alto-\ gether is rough and massy we shall exhibit here the picture of polyphemus and gklatek.\ polyphemus on the sea-shore inflamed with the love of the beautiful galateay\ who came to divert herself on the pleasant surges of the billows strove to please her with-his singing and music and thereby to gain her favours but she was-\ deaf to his fuit his rough-hewn enormous size and frightful aspect were her\ aversion wherefore she shuns him and derides his addresses.\ calm sea was seen on tlie second ground to the left appcared vast high rock hanging over the sea almost to the point of sight all rough and over-run\ with mofs and herbage going off to the left very cragged up to it huge stones\ were piled on each other as steps but three times higher from the edge of the\ water on the lowermost of them sat the monstrous cclops as wild and savage\ man his skin very swarthy and hairy his head and beard full of-bristly black\ hair spreading over his shoulders and breast he had but one eye-brow and that\ as wide as his forehead hanging over the eye which according to homer was\ as large as fhield placed in the middle of his wrinkled forehead his blubber\ lip turned up towards his broad and flat nose like that of negroe shewing\ his teeth set like those of saw out of his gluttonous jaws with grim jook by him lay his staff whichxlike those of herdsmen was crooked at one end and according to ovid bigger than the mast of ship knapsack or pouch hung at\ his side his raiment was goats-skin sewed together which he had shook from off\ his shoulders possibly to discover to galatea his conceited fine shape this garment\ was cream-colour spotted with black he \'92sat very rudely leaning little back\ against the rock his left leg was stretched out towards the water and his right with the foot fore-shortened lifted up lay over piece of the rock his flure with an hundred pipes he held in his left hand up at his mouth as if he had\ been just playing his head inclined with his eye to heaven towards cepid who stood near and flattered him his mouth was open as if he were singing and\ and his right hand upright on his knee seemed to beat time it was curious to\ see the method cunid took in the midst of his play to stick an arrow into poly-\ phemus\'92 breast without his being sensible of it.\ cupid was about half as big as the cyclops arm or leg so that though he had\ elimbed up the second step he could scarce reach the cyclops shoulder in order\ to stroke with his right hand the hair from the giant\'92 eye when pointing\ with stretched finger of the same hand towards the sea he laughing stuck with\ the other an arrow in polyphemus\'92 breast under his lifted arm cupid was of beautiful rosy complexion his hair yellowish white quiver tied with red\ safh hung by his side and his bow lying near hiin.\ the fair galatea in the mean time sitting on large sea-shell in the middle of\ the nearest distance was drawn by two dolphins encompassed with tritons and\ nereids sounding their shelly trumpets and playing on timbrels and other in-\ struments she sat fronting in the shell and the dolphins which sne guided\ gently turned to the right she was fohowed by other tritons bearing beautiful\ naked virgins and crowd of sea monsters who gradually uniting with the\ farthest distance disappeared this whole crowd was grouped in the form of\ crescent galatea appeared to surpass all in beauty.\ lat first thought this might possibly be venus herself because three beauties\ attended her whom took to be the three graces but she looked somewhat\ younger and not so wanton as venus is usually represented her breast also rose\ less and her head-attire was quite different from venus for her white hair twist-\ ed in tresses and elegantly flowing was here and there stuck with white bell-\ flowers and the locks in each side tied together on the head in tuft and hang-\ ing down both before and behind made plainly appear how gently she glid over\ the billows what most charmed m\'e9 was that in\'92 this great crowd one might\ see the particular sways turnings and affections of every figure on\'e9 moved slow-\ ly another swiftly as their beards hair and veils plainly shewed some bending\ backward as blowing others forward almost to the water some were full of\ foam others swimming as evenly as if they moved on looking-glass so that their\ glitter was scarce visible in the water this second venus as call her had greenish blue scarf which coming over her lap twined about her right leg advancing her naked left leg she set her foot on the scroll of the shell her head little flung back inclined to her right shoulder her breast projecting and\ the right arm stretching cross her body supported her rein-hand on her naked\ knee her countenance was modest and smiling her cyes somewhat downissi made me think that th\'e9 sun was too powerful for her but more nearly per-\ ceived she was talking to sea-nymph or nereid who near her chariot lay be-\ hind on triton staring towards the shore at polyphemus whither galatea with\ her left hand little fore-shortened was pointing the top of the rock was al-\ most shaded by cloud which shade run across the piece and set off galatea and\ he zetinue the whole group was agrecably lighted and \'92though the light was\ strong yet the shades near the water were soft and melting by the glitter or re-\ flexions of it which in my opinion was fine piece of conduct behind the\ rock towards the right side appeared beautiful tracts of verdant land adorned\ witfi\ with variety of \'92trees extending crescent-ways by the point of sight and sdme\ herds of oxen goats and fheep were grazing in the off-scape were hills and on\ the right side town forwards on the same side in the corner piece of sea-\ rock appeared whiel galatea and her company seemed to avoid.\ as we have reprefented the persons of polyphemas and galatea so it will not bo\ amiss to shew those of the tritons and nereids also pausanias describes the tritons\ thus their upper parts from the nagel were humnan but cov\'e9red with thin shiarp and rough scales and downwards their bodies instead of feet ended in large split tail their hair long and bluiffi and entangled as if in twist their\ cyes greenisn their ears nofe and mouth like those of men the latter very\ large and wide their teeth like those of panther their fmgers and-nails like\ the outside of an oyster-shieil or such substance on their breasts and bellies and undet their ears they had fins like little wings which helped them in\ swimming.\ alexander ob alexandro says that the uereids are shaped like beautiful virgins\ down to the navel but the lower parts joining together like fisn end in an\ eel\'92 tail their heads are mostly unveiled their hair disheveled and beset with\ pearls coral and other sea productions.\ second pictilre.\ polyphemus from the top of the rock where he sat playing viewing his beloved\ galatea bestowing her smiles on acis was so enraged \'92thereat that full of fury he tore piece from the rock with intention to crush them both which gala-\ tea escaped by diving into the sea put acis not nimble enough in running was\ struck with it.\ this piece is fellow or sequel of the preceding the rock is here placed on contrary side to the former behind it an island allo in the form of crescent towards the right extends acrofs beyond it the sea is seen along the horizon the\ rock on the right side goes down in rough steps and follows fandy way forward\ on its left to the middle of the piece where it ends in the frame the unhappy\ acis falls here in the sand under the huge piece of rock wijh his arms extended and his face downwards yet somewhat turned towards the sca he is not quite\ dead because the great weight rolling in the air only took fim in the-leg as he\ was running the enraged eclops not content with this foams at mouth and\ gripes an heavier piece of the rock in order to destroy the faithless galatea me-\ vara with her smoaking pitchy torch eggs him on and enflaming him with hel-\ lisni fury points towards the sea at the objects ofhis revenge at which he looks\ back and now what force he sheus in rending the rock all his members are\ distorted his sinews stretch and his muscles swell drawing in his mouth on one\ side with the upper teeth and his eyes is half shut does he not look as if he\ were anatomised or flead nay the least ofhis muscles works and presses through\ his thick skin his hair stands an end and his beast-skin garment being got loose\ from his girdle drags on the ground and he treads on it with his left foot the\ goat\'92 feet hanging to it appear to fly about according to his motion he bends\ doubl\'e9\ double ons ofhis kn\'e9es almost tonching his breast and with his right foot against\ the rocks he with both hands and all his force tears off piece of it tisiphone half behind him with her upper parts above his head and her facea little fore-\ fhortened and downwards points with her whole right hand not finger at galatea her left hand are some serpents and fire-brand her garment is black or dark grey here and there stained with blood the sea swells and the billows beat with great\ violence against the rock as if they would swallow up the shore on the left side\ eomes galatea in her chariot drawn by two dolphins not gliding as before but\ tosfing sometimes on the topof the waves and sometimes beneath theni with the\ hinder part of herchariot almost upright she stands stoping with her arms slungout looking back with amazement and her reins- slack her disordered locks sly in loose\ tr\'e9sses-against the wind caused by her swift motion her veil\'92got loose drops be-\ hind her into the fea\'92 her lovely members are overpowered by her inward\'92\ troubles the muscles of her neck before smooth now rise her heart seems to\ pant and her legs faltering she seems to sink her grace leaves her and she is no\ longer galatea fright has robbed her of her fresh colour and she is rather marble statue than living person.\ considering this ordonnance istood surprised is it possible thought to be paintingp it is certainly past my understanding it is reality itself and yet it\ must be picture for what is too hard for the pencil of judicious master be\ it what it will it is real nature to me and am satisfied but to proceed in the off-scape on the left side some ships appear in storm and two in the\ middle of the piece riding at anchor and boat landing some people this made\ me thing that it was ulysses who had design on the eye of the cruel and\'92 glut-\ tonous devourer of men it is even sa can perceive them to be greeks by their\ armed gallies and whole equipage the\'92sea is white with-froth and the waves\ beat towards the point of sight the air as in commotion and full of driving clouds\ whichicause here and there large ground fhades- the main light falls on polyphe-\ mus and the under part of the rock and takes in almost the whole shore sor-\ wards but the stone which falls on acis is with his under parts in shade caused\ by bit of fide rock which strongly sets it off against the light cupid in the mean time above the horison comes flying forward turning full of sorrow and cries to the right down where acis lies his left hand is up to one eye and his right wlierein is his bow over his head te shade it from the sun his quiver is reversed\ and the arrows drop into the sea acis lies on the fore ground with his shoulders\ bare and he is seen little right sideways his hands half covered with sand are\ wide open as if he were swimming his hair is dark and his garment dark green.\ galatea between him and polyphemus with the rock runs acrofs the piece she is\ seen right sideways and her face is fronting the off-scape consisting of hills boscage beautiful lawns and rivers is clearly lighted there appear also some\ aattle grazing as-in the former piece under the impendance of the rock and\ close to the sea lies red cloth garment in shade undoubtedly left there by aeis which was in my opinion artfully contrived in order to point out the place\ where this- unhappy couple had been sitting the shore is covcred with cockles\ and many other sea productions large greenisn coloured tortoise is seen mak-\ ing\ ing froin under acis towards the sea polyphemus\'92 slute lies by him but the bag\ still hangs by his side the top of the rock is dark against light clouds driving\ thither the light comes from the side of the piece.\ after had exactly weighed all the circumstances of the two pieces was con-\ sidering whaj the master\'92 principal drift might be and found them to be an ex-\ ample of love or slattery of the senses wantonly affecting the body without vio-\ lence in the person of polyphemus in the first piece and in galatea an easy in-\ difference without any passion for perceived her motion was smooth and her\ beauty in its perfection she was not attended by any cupids because such as\ have fins instead of wings usually wait on the nereids was so rejoiced at this\ observation that can not express it.\ inquiring likewise what might be learned from the second picture concluded\ that the author intended to express the unhappy issue of love in the person of ga-\ latea passion both warm and sudden for the least disorderly affection puts the\ chief members of the body in commotion and disturbs the peace of the rest that\ of polyphemus is violent cupid is subject to compafsion only as think where-\ fore he is represented crying possibly to shew childishiness for children com-\ monly laugh or cry about things which seem strange to them.\ commentonthe characters in the aforesaid pictures.\ polyphemus the sicilian herdsman the most savage and gigantic of all the gclops was according to homer son of neptune and the nymph thosa the word gyclops\ signifies having but one eye in the middle of the forehead whereby some would\ imply the thunder and lightening according to the greck names of his com-\ panions brontes sterope and pyradmon and other effects of the air round which\ they are always attending in readiness at the command of jupiter the air they\ say being placed in the middle of heaven as an eye in the head thus the\ commentators on hefiod in his theogonia deorum origo deliver.\ hesiod says that galatea daughter of nereus and doris is so named from her\ whiteness signifying parabolically the froth of the sea wherefore this poet af-\ cribes toher white hair and face like milk he says further that some writers would by galatea allude to the sweet water which falls into the sea because nothing is\ sweeter than milk and by polyphemus the air which loves the sweet food.\ the youth acis is called by ovid son of the river faunus and simethis being\ both young beautiful and well shaped.\ the tritons are counted by most of the poets sons of neptune and amphitrita because the sea says vermander is esteemed the mother or producer of many\ ftrange creatures which its element is very inclineable to and the ancient hea-\ thens perceiving thus somewhat wonderful ascribed to the sea some divinity as\ they also did to those tritons whose help they implored in dangers at sea but they\ who examine more narrowly into the agyptian hieroglyphics say that the tritons\ by their amphibious form of being human upwards and dolphin-like dovnwards are compaired to the two watry virtues saltness and sweetness teaching us that\ both good and evil spring from their nature and constitution to wit good from\ the\ the human nature and nothing but evil from the fifhinefs for ths human form says phurnutus is compared to sweet water which is proper for the aliment of\ noxiousto the animals of the carth and air and also to plants causing them to\ die and wither as we read in plutarch of the nature of things.\ touching the nereids we find in plato that there were an hundred of them h\'e9fiod says hfty and gives us their names of which glauce cymodoce galatea cyrene drimo deiopeia xantho arethusa phillodoce euridice nes\'e6e leucothoe spio thalia cydippe pafithea lycorias ligea ephyre opis asie clymene and\ halia are the principal their lower parts being hsni-like has given the poets oc-\ cafion to feign that they were very beautiful nymphs who accompanied their\ gods viz the ocean thetis neptune and nereus and doris their father and mo-\ ther and many others who signify the different qualities and various effects of\ the waters they were stiled mothers of the floods because the rainy clouds be-\ ing exhaled from the sea are the origin of floods wherefore on account of the\ virtue of the earth\'92 moisture towards the procreation of animals trees fruits flowers they were worshipped by the heathens as the nurses of them.\ having largely handled the off-spring and signification of the characters in both\ har-\ the aforesaid pictures we shall pafs to general explication of the latter.\ mony in music arises from an agreeable mixture of discording and flat sounds with\ concording and sharp ones but in love it is otherwise where dissimularity can-\ not be brought to agree or two hearts to join which do not sympathise by an\ harmony of humours the hideous make of the cyclops is frightful to the beau\'ac\ teous galatea who shuns him for her dearer acis by pobyphemus in this last storys\ we learn that those persons sue in vain who flatter themselves that their trouble-\ some addresses gain the aff\'e9ctions of those who hate them contrarily acis blessed\ with the smiles of his mistrefs shews us the danger of exposing ourselves to the\ resentment of powerful rival from whom at any time we must expect nothing\ but death it may also say serve for an example of the power of beauty which so bewitched acis that he could not forbear loving though at the expence\ of his life thus we are bewildered by our own inclinations and brought to the\ place of inevitable misfortunes where we are plunged in tears to the weakning of\ our vital strength as in this fable of the young and amorous acis when galaiea\ transformed him into fountain.\ opposite to these poetic pictures saw two others treating of love but differ-\ ently as being the sacred stories of samson and delilah the sense of the first is\ this third table or picture.\ samson resting on delilahis lap his hair is cut off whilst he sleyt and the philis-\ tines lie in wait to seize him-\ here samson is sitting near the center of the painting on carpet which covers\ the floor and reaches over three circular steps before couch whereon sits de-\ lilah with his head in her lap her right foot rests on small foot-stool agaiast\ which he is leaning with his left knee somewhat raised the foot of that leg is\ under his right thigh which is somewhat fore-shortened but the leg is seen at\ full length with his shin fronting his right arm hangs down between his legs resting on the outfide of his hand which is seen inwardly supporting his head on\ his left arm over delilah\'92 lap with the elbow standing out he is all in an heap and his head hangs little forward and sidling.\ delilah\'92 right arm is about his neck and her upper parts bend little over to\ the left when looking another way sne with her left hand pushes from her an\ old woman who stepsback having both her hands joined under her chin and key in one of them and with her mouth shut smiles at delilah delilah\'92 eyes are\ fixed on young man standing near her who gently lifting up samsen\'92 hair is cut-\ ing over him with his arms extended and legs close and his garment between\ them that it may not touch the sleeping samson near him stands boy with basket to hold the cut locks he looks back at philistine who is coming towards\ them with rope in his hand he pouts with his mouth and has finger thereon in order to make the other keep back little the aforesaid philistine walks stoop-\ ing advancing his right leg and supporting his body with the other which is\ quite bent he thrusts out his head and his elbow is drawn in holding the rope\ with both hands close to his body another on the right side behind him is lift-\ ing up curtain and looking after him between\'92these two rises large column and another on the other fide of the latter whereon the aforesaid curtain hangs these curtains and their pedestals run towards the point of sight behind the last\ philistine stand three or four

appears large pillar or piece of walling\ against which stands an hexagonial leafed table supported by three mermaids back to back on triangular foot of black stone on the table are several bags-\ of money from behind the table young servant-like man is gently advancing\ with more bags of money in his arms looking back suddenly with knit eye-brows over his right shoulder at the couch at his heels is another bearer with copper\ vessel full of money which he lugs very heavily before him his upper parts\ falling back and he screwing his mouth puffing and blowing he is well set of sedate countenance and his hair and beard are frizzled beside the couch below the steps in the shade is seen the statue of venus on pedestal misteriously\ representing astaroth next it stands commander of the philistines with staff in\ his hand he somewhat thrusts out his head and if mistake not thene are more\ people behind him lost in the snade on the right side of the steps close to the\ foremost column stands censor the smoak whereof ascends up the column the\ apartment is hung round with dark tapestries of landseape and between them are-\ broad pilasters the floor forward is inlaid with banded compartments.\ delilah is wantonly dressed having nice head attire mixed with ribbons and\ pearls long hair-lock of brown shining colour comes over her bosom her-\ garmeng\ gartent of white

white her left leg covered\ by the drapery afore-mentioned hangs down by the couch as if she was standing on\ it with the foot behind the foot-stool from her right shoulder hangs slooping beautiful sea-green veil tied on the left side the flaps whereof are partly on the\ bed on one side and down her thigh on the other.\ samson is of large size and robustly membered of swarthy hue with black\ hair and beard and hairy breast his drapery is dark purple which fastened.\ with girdle about his body buckled on his side and gathered about the waist cemes down between his legs covering the right thigh the flaps of it finely fold-\ ed lying sideways on the carpet the old woman\'92 head is bound with yel-\ lowish cloth and her garment violet or blue with streight sleeves tied under her\ breast

rolled about his middie and coming down half way\ the thighs the table is eovered with sine red stuff hanging down on each side.\ the floor carpet is dark and variegated like turkey work.\ the light of the piece proceeds from the left \'e0 little fronting as if from afingle\ window whereby the middle group and steps receive the broadest light the\ soldier with the rope before the steps is more lighted on fide the statue standing in the shade receives reflexed light from the floor the commander of\ the philistines takes little light on his shoulders the young man laden with the\ bags of money is with the tables next to him in shade but the other bearer\ receives the light directly on his raised naked breast.\ second table or picture.\ after samson\'92 hair was cut off and he tied hand and foot he awakes and\ finding himself thus wretchedly trapped by delilak arises full of wrath striking\ and pulhing all away from him as well as he is able but is at last overpowered\ and seized.\ here in his fury he stands inithe midile of the giece turned with his left to\ the light and straddling hiis feft elbow rises with the hand and arm down be-\ hind his head his right hand comes forward with the elbow pulled back by quite\ rope by one of the philistines his right leg advances and the left falls\ back back yielding to the weight of his heavy body which bends backwards two\ persons lie at his feet either knocked or kicked down and the third lies on the\ right side against balustrade with one hand on the floor and catching hold of\ the pedestal with the other his head drooping he spits abundance of blood.\ on the left side of samson littie forward stands the commander of the philistiner punching him in the breast with his left fist and with the right wherein he holds\ staffon high threatning to beat him behind the commander stands soldier who having flung rope about samson\'92 neck pulls forward the naxareau heroe\'92\ almost mastered head whose mouth is clofe and checks are swelling behind\ samson another stooping soldier is pulling rope fastened to his right foot the\ aforesaid balustrade on the right side backwards runs towards the point of fight and the door is in the middle of it through which rufhi in three or four men shouting and armed with truncheons staves and other weapons of whom the\ foremost with staffor half pike seems to strike with all his might at the reeling\ samson their fury is very great on this occasion.\ little to the left behind samson and close to the couch delilah is seen em-\ bracing the statue of venus and looking back with astonishment she is some-\ what high on the steps which run crofs the piece just beyond her the old wo-\ man is either ffung down or falling and with one leg little up shews her na-\ kedness by reason of her garment somewhat turned up she has one hand on the\ sloor and the other coming forwards in the corner forwards hangs part of large curtain which covers part of the table whereon lies the money the two\ vouths mentioned in the former come running in fright endeavouring to\ hide themselves between the table and wall the one is already half behind it and.\ the other is looking back with his head between his hands.\ somson\'92 drapery lies half on the steps and the refidue is under his feet together-\ with some weapons as half pikes and headepieces of the slain the commander\ of the philistines has vestment reaching belbw the knees and loose drapery\ about his arm about his head is allight grey fillet fastened behind with gold\ ribbon the main light takes samson and the parts about him delilab is in reflecting light and deep in the piece.\ these two pictures were not inferior to the two former in pafflons the ordon-\ nance light and colouring surprised me and induced me to think saw the very-\ action and lise itself was persuaded that if iknew not that it was samson and.\ delilah must have guessedat by their makes faces and motions and what\ was most wonderful the fact and drift could not only be naturally seen but also.\ its cause and what the issue would be whether good or bad in the first pi\'e8ce .\ could easily perceive that samson was to be betrayed and if did not know it the circumstance oft his hair cut offs money told and ropes at hand would make\ me surmise it yet this could not be done without bloodshed as in the fecond\ piece wlicre he is seized and ropedlike an ox for the sacrifice who if the first\ blow fail rouses pushes down and tramples under foot all that he meets with till at length tired he is mastered and thus led back to the altar again just so\ it appeared to me-\ truly we see few fuch pieces so efficaciously expressed every thing as the\ apartient by-works and incidents were so proper so needful to explain the\ matter that the omiffion of any of them would have made the ordonnance imper-\ fect what an effect has the statue of venus in pointing out the lasciviousness of\ this heathenisn woman does not the naughty old woman with the key in her\ hand plainly shew that she is in her own house not in that of samson or the\ commander of the philistines or of what use would the money on the table be af we saw not by the bearer that it was not samson\'92s for he is asleep and the\ money now brought in but if on such an occasion the running of the bearers and the noise of the money be thought improper as discovering the plot say\ there is no impropriety in it fince it is posfible to run bare-footed over marble\ floor without any noise and to set down bags of money without rattling all\ here is husfi no body speaks for every one knows his business..\ in the second piece delilad makes to the statue for protection why does she\ yet she can-\ flee and why in such fear after samson is bereft of his strength not be easy she is tossed between hope and fear and her anxiety makes her catch.\ hold of any thing she meets with and as long as samson is present she retains her\ trouble the commander\'92 paffionate motion is think very proper for\ the dead bodies lie about him he would not have exposed himself to the danger of\ approaching samson had he not been securely tied now rushing from his lurk-\ ing place he falls boldly on samson possibly not so much to shew his own valour .\ as to spirit the others for he fooks not at samson but at the soldiers the old\ woman\'92 lying tumbled down is not improper as being feeble-legged and full of\ fcar and although she have noshare in'the action yet it is not repugnant to the\ story if only for delilah\'92 sake and for the same reason she is flung into shade.\ her garment turned up can be no great scandal to an ill woman.\ let us now confider both the pictures but chiesly the signification of samson\'92\ hair and the love of delilah.\ we read briefly in scripture raany things touching the hair of samson of which-\ he was very careful because whilst it grew it became longer and thicker where-\ by he gained greater strength for breaking the ropes witn which he was at any\ time bound but being cut off his strength forsook him and his whole body.\ was subject to weakness.\ by the person of samson the nazarean we understand man ehosen by heaven -\ and devoted to its service for the mei of that order took as have said especial-\ care of their hair which gave them virtue adorning the head the under-\ standing which the more it encreases the more courageous we become against\ assaults of our enemies by enemies endeavouring to bind us we understands.\ h\'fbman inclinations and the fire of concupiscence when now through frailty we are seduced by this delilah those corrupt affections whereby the lust of steep-\ overpowers-us and we slumber in her lap right reason becomes useless and we\ cease todo good thus we are shorn by the wiles of women that is by means-\ of voluptuousness we are deaf to the impulses of the spirit and then of course lie\ apen to our enemies both to scorn and crush us \'92for-worldly affairs are so affecting that\ that they have no sooner got the mastery but we find ourselves crossed either\ by covetousnefs love ratrid jealousy or other disquiet but returning our-\ selves or awaking we become sensible of our folly and\'92 through contrition gra-\ dually recover our hair and thereby our strength and then dying to sin we at\ once overcome both ourselves and our enemies.\ the hair cnt off also implies the weakness of the faculties of the soul or spirit or even death itself.\ euripides testifies that alcestus could not die before mercury came from heaven\ to cut off his hair minos likewise could not overcome king nijus unless his fatal\ hair were cut off by his daughter and dido says virgil could not die before\ juno who pitied her long agony and lingering death sent lris to release the soul\ from corporeal ties by cutting off her white hair and offering it to pluto.\ these two last hisforical pictures differed from the two preceding in this that\ they were not mixed with poetic figures as cupid or love mag\'e6ra or rage and such like to help the expreffion of the paffions or meanings fince it is cer-\ tain that real truth could not be discerned from fiction by mixture of both.\ and although the statue of venus in 'this matter of fact seem to be of that nature yet it is nothing to the mean point but ferves only to shew that the plaoe was\ heathenifh and where probably such figures were common among that people.\ of the pictures in the second story built after the\ doric order.\ after viewing this apartment which could not enough admire ascend-\ ed the second story into another of more elegant architecture after the\ boric order this room was not so long but \'e0 little higher than the former and met'there with the following pictures.\ the valiant hercules after having performed many wonderful exploits not able\ longer to resist the indignation of juno his step-mother through smarting rage\ burned himself occasioned by the poisoned shirt of nessus which deianira had\ sent him out of jealousy that he loved lole daughter of euritus king of oecalia.\ jupiter much concerned at this carried him\'92to heaven in triumphant chariot and placed him among the stars in the number of the gods.\ this prospect was wild woody and mountainous in the middle of the piece\ little to the right near the point of fight was seen alarge pile of rough wood\ lving cross-ways not as chopped but rent afunder having roots and branches.\ the upper wood was small and the under very large lying parallel with the piece.\ here the unhappy heroe the scourge of monsters was lying extended over his\ lion\'92 fkin with his head to the right and feet to the left side turned somewhat\ backward and his breast leaning over his face little rifing and bending\ forwards forwards was seen in profile from the right\'92side discovering resignation unattened\ with pain his left arm was quite raised with the hand behind under his head the other arm lay out little forward on the wood with the hand half shut and\ the inside towards the body his right knee was wholly drawn up with the\ foot inelining towards it the other leg was represented hanging off as if he would\ lift himself somewhat higher philoctetes before the wood little to the right kneeling on his left knee supported his bent body on his elbow and right knee.\ he looked downwards holding before his face part of his garment as if he\ were weeping and with toech in his left hand setting fire to the wood in the-\ midctle of the piece behind the pile on the second ground was seen trumphal\ chariot finely adorned with carving and gilding and children with garlands of\ palm the foremost wheel like star appeared sideways half behind the ground\ and the horses turning to the right almost fronting got somewhat higher.\ mercury was seen entire tohis left foot which was hidden behind the ground on\ which foot leaning back he supported himself he advanced with his right\ leg forwards the burning pile with his right hand behind him wherewith he\ drew in the rein as if he were going to stop looking back he was accosting ju-\ piter riding on the air and pointed at hercules with his left hand quite open and\ \'e0 little fore-shortened jupiter\'92 upper parts came forward with his legs fore-\ shortened towards mercury pointing upwards with his right hand and scepter cross his bedy and in his left holding thethunder against his thigh behind the\ chariot above hercules to the right side the ground rose up hilly behind the\ horses were seen high pine trees and eypresses and some broken stems and behind\ mernezy were others somewhat lower and further on the left side up to the horizon appeared the sea and not far in it rock almost in the form of an affrighted man which judge to bethe unhappy servant lychas who-was flung into the sea by his\ master\'92 fury on the-before-mentioned rocky hilk stopd smoaking altar and\ next it aburning fire-pan and the glub of herzules in the pannel of the altar was.\ carved an \'e9agle with open wings and ithe thander in its bill sirring on fostoon of oak leaves in the front of the piece on the left -side lay verv large\ body of an old tree tore up by the roots and the hole in the ground thereby\ made was still apparent the roots abounded with fibres and the other end came\ forwards to the middie of the piece where it went into the frame here and.\ there lay some may branches and stones throvn off their bafes on the ground by philoctetes lay hercules\'92 ivory bow and quiver adorned with gold and of fize bigger than ordinary the strap being enriched with gold buckles on this-\ quiver was small inlaid or chased figure representing atrapos the last of the fatal.\ sisters with her sciffors.\ this piece was strongly lighted from the right side little fronting the-\ hill and altar anc hind part of the chariot were mostly in the shade of the\ trees the fore parts of the horses and the upper parts of mercury half way\ his thigh were in the light and the rest downwards with part of the ground was in shade jupiter placed very high almost to the frame received the light\ behind his head shoulder and arm and the rest of his body was in shade against\ the light sxy the trees behind the horses were pretty dark.\ philoctetes.\ philoctetes son of paans was arrayed in sattin coat of armour of bright\ straw-colour the straps were gold embroidery on greenisn blue ground his.\ upper-garment hanging behind him and tucked up about the middle in the\ girdle between it and the hilt of his sword was crimson also embroidered with-\ gold as were likewise his bufkins his hair was fair and short-curled he had\ little beard his helmet and half-pike lay by him the helmet was seen little.\ inwardly and elegantly wrought with gold and silver large white feather\ hung from it carelesly on the ground.\ the naked body on the pile of wood appeared very beautiful the breast somewhat heaving received strong light the muscling of the stomach and ribs\ was well expressed but on the arms and legs faintly the toes of the right foot which had yet some motion fhrunk inwardly his eyes were dying and the balls\ drawn towards the corners the mouth somewhat open seemed either to send\ forth sighs or fetch breath or utter for the last time some moving words which raised the utmost sorrow in philoctetes and melted him into tears as thought mercury was almost naked having only small green filk scarf about\ him wherein stuck his cauduceus.\ the horses were winged and the head of one\ appeared but that of the other was behind mercury.\ this piece was particularly remarkable for the death of the heroe and did\ not lil agree with what we have before in this work observed touching the con-\ dition of man in very hot summer questionlefs the poison not only worked\ is body outwardly but inflamed and consumed his very intrails for this rea-\ son also thought he must die his breath was misty and his mouth gaped af-\ ter coolnefs his eye-lids stiff'and heavy through inward heat he could hardly\ keep open his sight smothered by the steam and its motion retarded by the\ slackness of the optical nerves drew towards the utmost corners the sweat\ broke out and he shined with wetnefs chiefly about the breast over which\ waved thin damp like the fumes of boiling water which made his out-line\ unite with the ground in this part it was that the unhappy heroe had the most\ feeling and where the blood leaviag the members and seeking for shelter was\ retiring to the heart his breast was swelled and as he fetched breath heaved\ and set his belly was fallen in and the ribs were prominent his upper parts\ to the navel were of warm and fiery colour yet fresh and beautiful as was\ also his face his lips were not as yet dead nor pale but his hands and feet al-\ most burned black his eye-brows appeared drawn somewhat upwards as one\ who though sleepy strives to keep awake the arms and legs were bare pale\ and shrunk as partaking of death but the fingers knuckles knees and toes were violet heightened with yellow about the ribs and belly were seen some\ red and violet spots of the poison and his linen shoved underneath at the navel hung in rags the major part whereof was under his body and thigh and partly\ stained with blood thus the illustrious heroe thunder to the wicked lay in\ jupiter very much moved cast his eyes downwards fideways on the pi-\ agony.\ tiful body and spake to mercury who looked up at the celestial ruler with con-\ cern as if he were saying ee look father he is expiring no people w\'eare\ seen thereabouts except those before mentioned nor any satyrs or wood-gods.\ it is certain that if any have been there hercules frighted them away in his\ rage the sorrow of philoctetes was in my opinion inexpressible and the artist\ therefore with reason had covered his face but why paan\'92 son should be with\ hercules without servants could not apprehend but fancied it was because the\ painter thought it unnecessary this bosom-friend alone sufficiently explaining the\ matter second reason might be because the poet mentions nothing of it and\ lastly because the matter clears itself so well that any addition would alter it and instead of an unexpected act make it rather appear as premeditated fune-\ ral solemnity whence we may well infer that the pile was not prepared for\ him but that he himself made it on sudden as the poet relates.\ this artful piece was remarkable for these three things naturally and plainly\ expressed to wit the fact itself what preceded and what followed the be-\ ginning of the tragedy was when having received the poisoned shirt of nessus\ by lychas he offered it at the altar to jupiter his father the sequel of his rage ap-\ peared by that unhappy wretch\'92 being cast into the sea and metamorphosed in-\ to rock after which he burned himself and his succeeding triumph was shewn\ by the chariot which-jupiter sends him for his deification renascitur ex funere\ phaenix.\ the conclusions to be made from the persons of nessus deianira and lychas may be these.\ we learn from the centaur how dangerous the gifts of enemies are the cause\ of the great heroe\'92 death in deianria we discover her imprudent and indisereet\ pafsion and the effects of her jealousy which made her the instrument of her\ -husband\'92 death and in lychas we observe the miserable reward of his services and that the misfortunes of servants are sometimes by the great construed as to\ render obedience and disobedience equally culpable.\ over the door opposite to the former piece was seen another in an octagon equal to the width ot the door which took at first to be gap in the wall be-\ cause it was little darkishi but approaching found it thus.\ second picture.\ amphitryo being with alcmena in her bed-chamber had before he went to bed laid the two children sphiclus and hercules in his shield under pavillion into\ which juno full of spite and rage cast two serpents in order to devour the two\ innocents especially hercules who squeezed them to death and flung them at\ amphitryo\'92 feet.\ forwards on the left side one step high were seen the two children lying in\ the shield encompassed with balustrade running from the fore-part of the piece\ towards the point of sight and which took up two thirds of the piece amphitryo at the children\'92 cry leaping out of bed with an undrawn sword in his hand came to see what was the matter and having one foot on the step he met with\ the young hercules looking at him with smile and grasping with both hands one of the serpents which he squeezed to death the other lying already at his\ feet amazed at this amphitryo started back the other child bawling out lay half tumbled out of the shield with pillow and part of the cloaths on the floor.\ behind hercules and beyond the shield hung the theban prince\'92 purple mantle\ over two half-pikes which stuck up slanting from the wall and were tied toge-\ ther over them little backward the baulked juno was seen mounting up-\ wards encompassed with dark cloud with her scepter by her side in her left\ hand and with the other lifted up seeming to threaten with her fist and looked\ down frowning at the children somewhat further beyond the balustarde in\ the middle of the piece rose four or five steps fetched in by an hand-rail reach\'ac\ ing quite crofs the piece behind them at the further ene in the middle of the\ piece was large and deep compass-niche or alcove having curtain drawn up\ and fastened on each side with two rings herein stood the bed the apartment\ was eight feet high and hung with tapestries and over them as far as could\ perceive the wall was divided into pannels wherein were some faint bass-reliefs representing warlike acts on the left side of the alcove in the corner was round pedestal or half column whereon stood burning lamp alcmena much\ concerned stood somewhat stooping on the steps looking earnestly about with small torch in her hand which sne held up high resting the other on the pedes-\ tal of the hand-rail and holding part of her white garment which buttoned\ under her chin and trailed behind her hair was tied up in white cloth the\ hind-works were seen by the torch in dim light except.the corner wherein the\ lamp stood which with the door adorned with fine foliage shewed somewhat\ stronger from juno proceeded some light rays darting on the children and there-\ abouts this light was not like that of candle but of the day or thunder it\ mostly fell on the under parts of the child in the shield his upper parts and head with somewhat of the pillow tumbled out were in the shade he turned in the shield\ his upper parts one way and his under ones another which were fore-shortened-\ amphitryo\'92 upper parts almost to the middle were in the shade of the clouds re-\ ceiving strong reflexions from the children and the floor stood pondering how\ mlemena came by the lighted torch but on narrow inspection found large gold-\ eandlestick standing near her by the other pedestal and wondered why alceus\'92.\ son had not taken it yet on further consideration concluded that through hurry\ and fear he overlooked it as usual on such occasions which alcmena perceiving she probably jumped out of bed and seized it such was this picture theie\ three lights were finely and distinctly observed the lamp which was distant gave\ white or pale light but somewhat foggy the flame of the torch was almost\ to the wick covered by the clouds under juno which as far as could appre-\ hend was an artful slight of the master in order to render the foremost light the\ brighter and stronger and to avoid the necessity of making the whole piece dark which otherwise he must have done for the sake of naturalness.\ juno had diadem and light blue garment her head-attire was wild and her\ locks flying about like serpents.\ the poets mention that hercules was represented by the ancients as an example\ of all virtues as well of the body as the soul squeezing serpents to death with\ his hands even in his cradle by which they give us to understand that man sitted for heroism ought from his infancy to shun pleasures and mortify carnal\ affections.\ now thinking to go out of the apartments to see what was further remark-\ able looking up higher perceived another picture against the covered cieling cupola-wise wherefore stopying to see it and examine whether it had any relation\ to the pieces before-mentioned found it to be the deisication of the aforesaid\ great heroe welcomed by jupiter and the whole train of gods and goddesses.\ jupiter sat in the middle high on his eagle hercules crowned with laurels was seen below directly under him standing with one hand by his side and\ having an olive-branch in the other he stood fronting down to half-way the\ thighs in the fore-part of the chariot which was on clouds the pole of it rose\ up little to the right side according to the course of the horses which mercury was\ guiding to the left side upwards swaying again to the middle and with the chariot\ making semi-circle so that the winged horses were seen mostly from underneath their breasts fronting and heads towards the right mercury held the reins in with\ his right hand close to his mouth the chariot was surrounded with many cupids having garlands and branches mercuary looked towards the right at jupiter who with his scepter directed him to circle of twelve glittering stars in the firmament which enlightened some small clouds in that quarter the whole celestial body\ sat on waving clouds exulting and clapping their hands the sun shined bright.\ was surprised that none had their badge of distinction except jupiter riding\ on his eagle and holding the thunder and mercury with his caduceus in his hand and wings on his feet but on consideration that the gods are well known to each\ other directed my eye to hercules and observed that he was without his club\ and lion\'92 kkin which induced me to think they were burned with his body neverthelefs hisfrizzled hair and beard and fine mein convinced me that it could\ be no body but hercules in fine examined all the gods and goddesses one\ after another and began to know them all to the very least apollo by his radiant\ air and beautiful body diana by her black hair and brown complexion bacchus by his jolly cheeks and members asculapius by his long tressed hair and beard venuts by ber squab members and amorous look momus by his foolish counte-\ nance and so forth each had his propercolours venus\'92 garment was red diana\'92 blue bacchus\'92 purple ceres\'92 ftraw-colour monna\'92 green and yellow which\ so distinguiffied them as to leave no room for doubt but juno and lris appeared\ not in their company because suppose the former could not bear the affront\ of seeing hercules thus honoured examined further into the ornaments of the\ apargment and perceived they were so orderly and well adapted to the subject as\ to raise wonder on both fides of the room ranged eight columns of pisan\ marble cross-cut into bands pretty wide from one another on each side cf the\ door and in each corner one and between these two others standing close together with their architrave frize and cornice and thereon parapet with pannels from\ which sprang the coving of the cieling in the middle whereof was this last men-\ tioned piece in an oval compartment of oak-leaves and acrons the metopes in\ the frize were adorned with foliage of the same fort of leaves and in the pannels\ of the parapet were festoons with crown of laurel hanging at them between.\ the two first and last columns appeared other festoons in oblong pannels and un-\ der each club and lion\'92 skin those feftoons were composed of palm branches with\ with their fruit on both sides of the door between it and the first column stood palm-tree whose branches reached up to the coving projecting very\ elegantly over the before-mentioned picture those palm-trees with the frizal\ ornaments were bronzed the architrave and cornice of serpentine stone and\ the frize like the columns pisan marble on each side of the door between\ the two first columns was large bass-relief of plain light and yellow marble.\ the one represented hercules asleep surrounded by the troop of pigmies the\ other shewed his awaking and hiding them in his lion\'92 skin from this first\ proof of his valour he afterwards got the name of hercules primogenitus on\ the other side of the apartment opposite to this last hercules was seen spinning\ by omphale and in the other pannel on that side his shooting nessus round\ the cieling-piece were twelve small circular pannels joined together with wreaths\ of palm-leaves these exhibited in faint bass-relief of fret-work the labours of\ hercules between them and the piece appeared some lions heads.\ before we proceed in our relation let us shew what the heathens understood by\ the deification of hercules.\ hercules the glory of valiant men shews us by his deification that those who-\ attempt that honour in their life-times as anthony with his cleopatra did or strive\ to obtain it by intreating and cajoling the people as most of the persian kings\ and romulus did mistake the right method whereas hercules\'92 whole life was ta-\ ken up in freeing the world from monsters and tyrants and no divine honours\ were paid him until after his death for eternity which he obtained only by\ death teachs that true virtue will not be flattered in this life as aleander prov-\ ed to those who were beforehand for calling him god by shewing them the\ blood which issued from his wounds in the same manner as from other mortals.\ how powerful and virtuous soever man may be as long as he draws breath he\ can not call himself happy as being no more exempted fxom the teeth of biting\ envy than hercules was in his life-time the heathens worshipped him as god according to their superstition beliving also that though alk souls are immortal yet those of valiant men pursuing virtue attain an higher pitch of honour and\ partake of the deity they even affign him in heaven hebe the goddess of youth for confort on account of his strength which is found only in youth.\ thus in after-times the philosopher and poet empedocles vainly in immitation\ of hercules who made his frind philoctetes swear never to reveal the place where he\ burnt himself nor what was become of him in order to induce the people to\ think he was taken up into heaven threw himself into mount ama but his iron\ slippers being cast out with the fiery stones discovered the case andthe truth-\ but to return to our relation.\ in going out of the apartment saw on the pavement sphara mundi or ter-\ restrial globe curiously inlaid divided on each side with compartments and cut\ with elegant bands of costly marble and jasper which ran to the center each\ stone shewed monster running off from the globe and such as hercules in his.\ life-time had delivered the world from.\ could not satisfy myself with the fight of this work. but having at last seen all\ things here by fide pair of stairs landed on paffage leading to another\ apartment of the lonic order nothing inferior to the before-mentioned in rich-\ ornaments and marble.\ ch.ap xi of the pictures in the third story built after the\ lonic order.\ na time as- s\'e9miramis was combing and binding up her hair news was\ brought to her of the revolt of the babylonians whereupon with one of the\ hanging untied she immediately marched against the rebels and bound\ not her hair untill she had regained the town and reduced the people to their-\ obedience.\ this courageous princess arose from her chair half coifed swearing with her\ right thumb held\'92up and with her left hand pulling her side-locks towards her the comb was as yet sticking on the table by her which was- covered with costly carpet of thick gold embroidery stood large oval looking-glass in al\ gold frame chased with foliage and on the top were two billing pigeons of un-\ polished silver on the table lay also some precious ornaments as bracelets neck-laces jewels and her diadem in the shape of pyramid beset with\ stones behind her chair stood young damsel holding gold plate with some\ cups pots and\'92little boxes of perfume behind this virgin appeared two others\ in surprise and mutual embrace on the left side was an old matron with her\ back fronting holding an opened letter in her left hand little more to-\ wards the middle another virgin was pulling away from the table into the cor-\ ner forwards littie fountain elegantly wrought and resting on four wheels in-\ the fore-part of the piece on the right fide meffenger was kneeling before the\ queen quite dejected at the furtber end of the apartment in the middle was gate-like opening and on each side of it term of white marble whereon hung\ shewed an entrance into another magnificent apartment adorned with bass-refee\ and other imagery at the further end of it was seen large shallow niche and\ under it broad pedestal or elegant seat on the side of which sat the figure of woman with the teet towards thelight holding in her lap aglobe whereon the right\ hand with scepter in it refted its head was adorned with tripple mural crown.\ over it in the niche stood bass-relief-like agrave man in majestic dress rest-\ ing his right hand on truncheon and having torch in his left he was crowned\ with flowers and about his neck hung gold chain this figure was golden and\ the ground of the niche azure blue the columns where of white and the build-\ ing of egyptian marble and the ornaments gold behind the matron at the end of\ the first apartment young damsel by the queen\'92 order which the matron signi-\ fied to her was climbed up reaching with one hand as high as sne could to take\ down\ down some arms off one of the terms\'92 which the matron with the bent fore-finger\ of her right hand beckonedto her to bring forwards where-upon the damsel\ looking back as fhe was untyingthe weapons.\ the queen stood by the table with her upper parts turaed little to the left her breast was half open and put out her head almost upright inclining some-\ what towards the left moulder her eyes staring hef mouth sittlen open as if\ she were speaking she was drest in white sattin over dark blue bodice or cuirafs richly embroidered with gold vand beset with precious st\'f4nes the sleeves were\ very wide but turned up and fastened with gold buckle or hook her gown buttoned above the knee and gathered up round about she was buskined half-\ way the legs her robe lying on the chair was of tyrian purple embroidered\ with gold and lined with ermine the young damsel who was busy in attiring\ the head of the princess was drest in violet the virgin behind the chair pushied\ somewhat by the queen\'92 starting up stept back and overthrew cup on the plate which put her out of countenance she was drest rose-colour and the two be-\ hind her in dark blue little greenisn the matron had long cloth garment\ of dark fillemot gold-bordered her under garment as well as could perceive\ by the sleeve was dark violet and her head elegantly wound with sillets of many\ colours the end whereof hung down her back the virgin who took down the\ weapons had pale apple blossom-coloured garment the messenger was seen\ sideways little hindwardly in small gold-fringed mantie dark gray or blackisn hanging halfway down his back his under-coat was light grey and reached be-\ low the knees his buskins were of beaft\'92 fkin he had dagger by his side or\ stuck in his girdle with \'e0 small staff in his hand his helmet having dragon\'92\ head and two wings on top like thole of bat lay by him his brown kkin shone\ with sweat as did his hair which was not long yet tied behind.\ the apartment received its-light from the right side through \'e0 large compass-\ headed window which fell strongly on the queen and about her little forward she caused ground-shade on the corner of the table by which the matron\'92 un-\ der parts were well set off the messenger was mostly in shade as being more\ forward than the window the hangings between the window and gateway were\ half in shade which set the princeis and the attendance behind her strongly off.\ in one of those hangings which were very old and of dark purple colour was\ wrought in costly needle-work the flood and noah\'92 ark and in the other the\ confusion of babel and the marching off and division of the people and above about the sweep of the gate as round the edges of medal were syriac characters\ or letters on the right side over the hangings the apartment appeared lighter by means of two circular windows running towards the point of sight the ciel-\ ing was covered the floor inlaid with large marbles of various colours about\ the table and on the foremost group lay large white round stone which gently\ united with the other light yet without attracting the eye.\ forward on the right side behind the messenger some steps went down to door below through the window appeared the off-scape or part of palm-tree.\ forgot to say tnat the weapons hanging on the terms consisted of quivers bows and swords in the bason of the golden fountain ran spqut of water up-\ on cloth or two and \'e0 spunge lying in it.\ over-against this piece on the opposite wall was the sequel of tlie preced-\ ing in second picture.\ here semiramis was seen setting out from her court with an extraordinary majesty\ and courage she descended tne steps very airily martial fire seemed to in-\ flame her heart which gave glow to her cheeks her eyes sparkled like two\ stars if she had not an helmet should by her dress and accoutremens have\ taken her for diana going hunting everything was in readiness for her march even to her robe which she refused to put on contented only with bow and\ arrows and her authority the waiting woman ran up and down stairs one bring-\ ing this another that one of the chief put the royal helmet on her head foot-\ stool was set for her below on the stairs whilst the other was girding the sword\ about her the curvetting horse inured to war stood ready at the stair-foot.\ the trumpets sounded and the people full of desire crowded about the pas-\ sage was cleared the horse divided into troops were drawn up in the inner-\ court the messenger ran down the further steps and the matron above in the\ gateway was gaping and staring at the preparations the sky was clear and seemed to favour the princess\'92 enterprize.\ having through hurry but transiently viewed these things could not possibly\ well remember every circumstance so as to give true description of that excellent-\ piece wherefore attentively placing myself before it my observations were as follows.\ on the left side was seen magnificent portico with four lonit columns sup-\ porting their ornaments and on each side balustrade and plinth runnig down\ five or six steps to large pedestal whereon lay lioneffes capped and covered .\ whose bodies were full of- syriac characters the gate was circular-headed and-\ over it key-stone which supported the cornice and wherein was bronzed lion\'92\ head over each column in the frize were some forts of heads and between\ them faint carved quiver and lighted torch acrofs on each fide in the wings.\ of the portico was niche the bottoms whereof were even with the sill of the\ door and running towards the point of sight at the extremities of those wings were two other columns standing against wall which ran on low ground to\ the middle of the piece this wall was divided by flat fascias in the nature of\ pilasters and between them were circular openings through which was seen the\ inner-court and above the wall its fide running deep in the piece towards the\ point of sight at the end of the wall was such another parallel with the fore-\ most which bounded the inner-court and further behind some palm and other\ trees rose above it on the fore-ground on the right side the ground was rug-\ ged up to the landing place of the steps descending into the fore-court in the\ middle of which stood large fountain of white marble resting on basis of four\ or eight arches which were supported by square smooth and high pillars of the\ doric or rustick order divided by rusticated or rock-like blocks over this work\ arose instead of an entablature large plinth three feet high of white marble like the figures on the top in the middle rifing three or four steps stood large terestrial globe supported by four sphinxes on which globe sat woman with\ her\ her fore-parts towards the court holding high in the right hand sun and\ downwards in her left moon on her helmet was an eagle with spread wings and on her breast-ornaments lion\'92 head her dress was like that of an heorine.\ on the lowest steps next the plinth sat the four parts of the world fettered against\ some trophies below between the pillars were copper-bronzed basons which\ received some spouts of water from within out of rock this huge pile stood\ in the middle of the piece against the point of fight half behind the wall the\ fore-court was rough and at the further end had steps ascending as aforesaid.\ thus wasthe plan of this picture and the disposition of all the fixed work shall now to the best of my sxill decribe the rest.\ little to the left of the point of sight the courageous queen was descending\ the steps with her left leg forwards and her body bending somewhat back poising on the right leg on step higher she swayed her upper-parts to the left with the breast fronting somewhat lifting up her left arm which was guarded\ with small shield at the same time stooping virgin girt her scimyter her\ right hand in which she hefd bow with the arm down-wards and quiver\ full of arrows appeared above her left shoulder crowned helmet ornamented\ with large white feather was set on her head by another and third with the\ royal robe which the princefs thought needless in this march was going up stairs\ again with her eyes fixed on the queen this virgin\'92 right side was little front-\ ing and she held the robe high in her left hand that it might not drag and with\ the right kept the rest close to her body her dark head-attire was strongly set off\ against the white fur or lining of the robe and her locks through her swifth\ motion were flyig behind and her gown ruffing between her legs she was girt\ just under the breast and had white sandals the gown was open on the fide discovering the bare leg and half the thigh her garment was rose-colour the\ matron near the gate-way stood stooping forward and wondering with her right\ hand on thebalustrade and looking down next the first step before the queen under the point of sight stood stooping damsel setting small ivory foot-stool covered with purple velvet for the queen to mount her horse by she held it with\ her right hand and with the other was tucking up her garment behind seeming\ fearful of the horse little from thence came from the right side of the piece voung man looking at the damsel and holding with his right hand fine horse\ by the bridle he was seen from behind his left leg advanced and the right drew\ quite back just touching the ground with his great toe his breast projected quite\ over his poise as if he were still walking striking the horse\'92 belly with his left\ hand to make him turn about the horse\'92 breast was fronting and his right\ side somewhat fore-shortened his head in profile the foremost leg prancing and\ the right drawing in as if he went backwards his open nostrils were white as\ were also the breast and legs the rest being dark or brown the bridle and other\ things were gold beset with stones having rich caparison set off with gold plates the housing was purple richly embroidered with gold powdered with pearls and\ other costlinesses and almost trailing the ground with sine tassels flying up at the\ horse\'92 motion the mane was drest into tresses and the tail buttoned up ty-\ ger\'92 skin covered the breast the young man had long light hair tied behind his\ his coat girt in the midctle was light -yellowi reflecting green being strongly\ set off against the purple housing his right shoulder with half his back was seen\ bare and his carnation beautiful and fresh his sandals were white the horse\ gave ground-shade over the damsel with the foot-stool and little beyond her.\ quite on the right side somewhat further stood two trumpts turned towards\ the inner court girt with beasts skins and sounding their trumpets almost\ like those of the romans were winding like serpents with dragons heads\ at the ends of them on the further side of the queen the messenger appeared\ running down the steps quite over his poise pointing with his right hand lit-\ tle fore-shortened forwards at the inner court with his face towards the queen by\ the little flying mantle behind him might be perceived the swiftnefs of his mo-\ tion his action like that of flying mercury being free and extensive he flung\ out his left leg and his right foot was quite behind and off the ground the\ people on the second ground below stairs to the pedestal of the first balustrade were seen between his legs these people as well men as women and children stood some wringing their hands others lifting them up high some embracing others clapping their hands the former for fear the latter for joy among the\ rest was seen distressed woman hanging her head sideways with her arms down and hands folded by her stood grave man talking to her almost mouth to\ mouth with his right hand pointing up to heaven and with his left giving her\ friendly look he pulled her by the sleeve as if he would have her take heart.\ some children were lying on and crawling up the steps in the fore-court some\ troops of horse were seen putting themselves into order and others mounting\ their horses on the further side of the place other people were coming running\ down the steps the off-scape behind them on the right side was hilly over\ the aforefaid steps at distance arose large pyramid and some palm-trees ap-\ pearing darkissi against the clear fky the fore-court was light and the inner\ court itself on the left side of white marble the wall on the further side of\ the steps was together with the people and beyond\'92the- lionesses shaded by cloud which strongly set off the foremost group whereon the main light fell.\ the trumpets on the same side with part of the balustrade on which thgy\ leaned were in shade forwards -in the corner was seen part of an open gate and its side-wall running up high just beyond the trumpets who thereby werc\ in'the snade receiving here and there from the opening little light on their\ under-parts and legs the gate was low because the ground run off sloping\ from the steps the ground with the hind-part of the horse being shaded by it.\ the horse and young man received small but very strong lights and shades the\ trumpets and gate were strongly reflected from the left side the people on the\ second ground against the balustrade were mostly lighted from on high by the\ blue of the sky and could have no reflexion because they stood parallel along\ the stairs behind the wall with round openings against the angle of the wings\ of the portico arose the top or leafing of large palm-tree which broke the\ length of the said wall at the same time caufing the extremities of the wings to\ unite agreeably with the inner-court the portico fronting the light was with\ the\ the balpstrades tof pisax and agyplian marble witht white ornaments.\ lionesses on the pedestals were of serpentine the upper steps were of white\ marble with eyes the large and spacious landing at the foot of the steps was\ of free-stone and the ground on the right side somewhat ruffet mixt with\ earth.\ the matron had as in the former piece dark sillemot upper-garment over\ violet one and her head was elegantly wound the young virgins were also as before she who girt the princess with the sword had an apple-blossom-coloured\ garment her coat being tucked up behind her head-attire was light against\ shade was putting on the queen\'92 helmet the young damsel below shaded by\ the horse was likewise drest in blue the virgin with the royal robe stood\ close to the foremost balustrade almost up the stairs behind the lionesses which\ were strongly set off against her light garment had almost forgot soldier\ standing in the gate near the trumpets with club plated with iron on his\ shoulder he had light grey linnen coat reaching below his knees with stock-\ ings on his legs and on his head copper helmet adorned with two beast\'92\ horns about his neck was fastened brownisn red beast\'92 skin with the paws to\ it and by his side dagger this man was entirely in the light of the gate.\ after thorough view of this picture began to consider wherein its good-\ ness lay which was what chiefly wanted wherefore taking my pocket-book set down in it the general heads in the following manner.\ first the dispofition of the irregular objects against each other whether high\ or low standing or lying.\ secondly the disposition of the grounds behind each other.\ thirdly the placing of the lights.\ fourthly the motion of the moving objects.\ fifthly the proper by-works climate and customs.\ sixthly the conditions or characters of the persons with the dresses and\ syrian equipage.\ seventhly the particular postures and paffions.\ lastly the harmony of the colours.\ being much rejoiced and inflamed with new ardour for further-inquiries saw opposite to the aforesaid two pictures on each side of the door the following\ bass-reliefs in white marble.\ in that on the right fide semiramis was standing on the fore-ground and by\ her an architect fhewing her on board the plan of town-wall on the\ left side were workmen busy in carving hewing cuting and sawing stones and on the second ground the said wall appeared faintly just above ground and\ next it was the town.\ in the otherpiece the queen was seen on horseback with quiver behind her and aiming at lion who rearing up approached her with an arrow through\ his body in the off-scape the town-wall appeared as finished and here and there\ some palm-trees- the figures were small life and finely wrought.\ between those bass-reliefs stood square pedestal in niche and on it the statue\ of semiramis with dead lion under her feet she was drest in the assyriau man-\ ner as an amazan with bow in her hand and quiver behind her and on her\ head\ head crowned helmet on the top whereof lay little dragon whose neck curled\ down the fore-part of it.\ the pedestal was porphiry and the figure massy gold.\ the niche like the building was intirely serpentine and the pillars and pilasters\ of agpytian marble.\ oyer the aiche was an oblong azure-blue table or fascia and thereon pile of\ burning wood of white marble out of the smoke whereof ascended pigeon.\ over each column was modillon of olive-leaves which supported the archi\'ac\ trave and in the frize were some arms not much rising all these ornaments\ were of gold.\ in the middle of the arch-work arose very large cupola and therein was celestial sphere of blue chrystal with the signs and circles of gold the half\ of this wonderful machine took up the cupola shewing itself in such manner a the sun shone on it and enlightening the whole apartment for which reason did not before take notice that the room had no windows on each side of\ in one was re-\ the sphere were two tables of fret-work and each had figure.\ presented srengih like an heroine holding an oaken-branch and having \'e0 griffin\ on the shield and in the other was also an heroine signifying political government leading bridled lion with the left hand and holding staff in the right by\ which figures and the sphere are understood the heavenly insluences as philosophers\ intimate.\ floor was like that in the under apartment inlaid with terrestrial globe juist under the cupol\'e2 where the light falling directly upon it made it rise and\ over the door in round copartment of palm keaves saw carved in white\ marble and old sea-god whom judged to be father ocean leaning on large\ sea-vase shedding abundan\'e9e of water running crofs through the piece out of\ which arose in-the middle large winged lion on the other side of the sea-god appeared smnall hill and thereon littie palm-stem this table was like me-\ dal of one deptb the sense alluded to the first rise ofthe assyrian monarchy re-\ presented by the winged lion according to the prophet dantel.\ chap xii of the pictures in ths fuunth story built after the roman\ order.\ when horatius had gajned the victory over the ffiree caratii and was\ going with his arms tosthel capitol he was met by his sister who espy-\ ing those qf her bridegrobt called her brother murtherer at which\ enraged he drew hia sword and stabbed her thereby staining the victory with\ his oun blood thaipeople- ijudging this to be cruelty voted that he had\ therefore rendered hiself uaworthy iof the victory and that he ought to be put\ this sorrowful triumph happened before the capitol at rome as when in its\ ancient state forward is seen large plain encompafsed with walls where lay\ two large lionesses of porphiry which it is probable the artist introduced in\ they have been of so long standing yet we may easily admit it on the right\ side was represented the proud capitol of marble and costly architecture after\ the roman order ascended by \'e0 spacious flight of steps on the top was this in-\ scription in gold letters senatus populusque romanus the\ senate and people of rome here they were mounting the steps with arms on\ pikes horatius followed sheathing his fword behind him his unhappy sister\ dropped down backwards the people from all corners flocked together mut-\ tering and cursing his cruelty but he regardless of it boldly went forward.\ before the steps about three or four pac\'e9s length the ground was paved with\ large grey stones the residue being rigged or uneven the foremost weapon\'ac\ bearer entering the gate held his trophy somewhat stooping within it he was\ seen from behind having almost the same action-as the gladiator his left arm\ extended and his right leg on the threshold the second two or three steps\ down held his weapon up against his body looking back at the- third who fol\'ac\ lowed close and was speaking to him this poised on his left leg having his\ right very much bent and the toes of it on step higher his upper parts swayed\ against his right breast and the bottom of it with his right hand the third\ carried the trophy on his fhoulder almost uprights his breast projecting and his\ back swaying little forwards with his elbow standing out settingthis right foot\ on the steps the left being quite behind and off the ground as walking on and\ the other before him as little stooping those three men were called velites or\ light-armed and drest in linen girt about the middle with daggers by their\ sides and plain helmets on their heads as we see in the prints of trajan\'92 column and other remains of antiquity three or four steps from thence just in-the\ middle of the piece horatius advanced in full armour holding an oliver-branch\ befide his scabbard in his left hand and on thie same arin which with the elbow was putting out and little fore-shortened small shield whereon was represent-\ ed lion his breast was fronting and the right hand lifted up and sheathing\ his sword his right leg was put forth somewhat bent and the other drawn far\ his face fronting he looked down on the iscabbards havifig on his head an helmet\ crowned with laurel and oak-leaves with faather behind which by the turn\ of his head and the swiftnefs of his walk slew to and fro mantle fastened on\ his right shoulder and tucked under his chin hung little over his left should-\ er one flappet of it flew behind and the other forwards flinging over his left\ leg the straps under his coat of armour and on the arms were short and broad and rounding at bottoms his buskins came half-way up the legs.\ from him forwards was seen the expiring virgin falling back with her feet ex-\ tended towards him and arms spread wide the right lifted up and the left sink-\ ing her breast turned to the light her right hip swelled her thigh was at full\ length and the leg little fore-shortened the left leg hid under the right her\ face also foreshortened leaned towards the left shoulder which with little of\ the breast was naked her breast garment girt under the breast was flving up-\ wards her upper garment sinking slung over her right leg and flappet of it hung\ over her left arm her light tresses by her tumble flew upwards beneath her little more to the left side was an aged woman supporting the noble virgin and\ shrieking out beholding the murderer she with her breast downwards and left\ hand on the ground and right hand lifted up was staying with her body the\ back of the dropping roman virgin her head was wound with cloths and fillets.\ just behind her appeared the half of pedestal whereon lay one of the aforesaid\ lionesses and somewhat further behind the fellow of it running towards the point\ of sight two soldiers followed horatius who in dissatisfaction seemed to\ turn back not far behind the conqueror were some spectators highly discontent-\ ed some were pointing at him some menacing ochers disdainfully turning their\ backs upon him it looked as if we heard them grumble on the fore-\ ground on the right side an aged man with one shoulder bare came hastily run-\ ning to see what was the matter he had on short coat with an herdsman\'92 cap on\ his head and flute and scrip at his side his under parts were with part of the\ fore ground in shade and his back fronted the light dog ran before looking\ back at him according to the custom of those creatures beyond the capitol part of wall with its architrave and large compass-headed gateway ran to-\ wards the point of sight this wall extended from thence crofs through the piece\ by the point of sight to the left fide and was divided by rusticated doric pilasters into squares wherein were small niches out of this gate just below the wall some cattle as oxen cows goats and sheep were coming with shepherd who at\ the noise was looking back this shepherd and cattle coming in at the gate made me believe he came from the market because it was behind the capitol.\ over the wall appeared several fine palace-like buildings as also column whereon was placed she wolf with the two children romules and remus above\ the angle of this wall on the right side in the off-scape was seen as well as could\ guefs the rock tarpeia rising up very high but neither pantheon monte cavallo vatican or colosseum as not being as yet known no ruins or broken buildings ap-\ peared here but all beautiful and whole except some little houses since the\ town had not been an hundred years standing nor before ruined on the left\ fide forward in the corner on rising ground stood woman by the trough of fountain astonisned and crying out who seemed as if she were going away lift-\ ing up one hand on high and holding out the other to young girl who came\ running in confusion child held by another girl sitting on the side of the trough was looking down on the ground on an overturned pot of milk this\ fountain stood against large pyramid which run towards the point of sight.\ several ordinary dressed people men women and children came running in\ groups three or four together from behind the pyramid others were returning\ from thence the young girl who came running in confuston had fhort coat and was barefooted and her hair very meanly tied behind these people and\ objects with the pyramid filled up almost fourth part of the piece row of\ low houses like an hamlet ran by the pyramid towards the point of sight and\ above theni arose some pines cypresses and other trees.\ this piece was lighted from the right side yet little fronting the capitol\ gave large ground shade over the steps beyond the two arms-bearers and con-\ tinued beyond horatius over two or three men who stood behind him against\ whom he was strongly set off the side walls with the gate reached half the\ height of the building the same receiving strong reflexions from the ground and\ having ground shades which were not too sharp the pyramid with the women\ and children was kept somewhat darkisn by reason of cloud except the top of\ the pyramid which received clear light the sky was full of clouds especially\ in the middle and on the left side of the point of sight behind the houses.\ the romans in those days except people of the first rank wore little or no va-\ riety in the colours of their cloaths they were mostly white or else light grey\ woollen for this reason as conjecture the designer of thefe pictures had made\ the principal persons to excel for perceived that the people were mostly in grey\ or white some little russet others inclining to green few among them ex-\ oept aged people had long gowns or garments horatius\'92 coat of armour fhewed\ golden the straps under it and on the arms were elegantly embroidered on fillemot ground his mantle was yellowish white with violet reflexion the\ scabbard of his sword was dark blue finely wrought the hilt represented an eagle\'92\ head his bufkins tied with vhite strings but quite fouled as judged by\ sand and dust were purple his sister\'92 upper garment was light blue her breast\ garment light yellow with violet reflexion almost like that of her brother.\ the\ aged woman beneath her was swarthy skinned her garment greenifh blue and\ plain the lionesses were dark porphiry and the pyramid of rocky stone.\ having sufficiently viewed this picture and exactly learnt all the circumstances\ of it took infinite delight in seeing how naturally the occurrence was expressed and that nothing was supersluoussy intreduced though the story does not\ make mention of all the persons who were brought into this representation.\ thought it is truly of great moment that the principal parts of story be well ex-\ pressed and herein good master has work enough to give each person his due\ paffion to the end the matter must speak for itself but it becomes still more ex-\ cellent by the addition of all other necessary circumstances though not to be found\ in the historiant after such manner that both appear natural.\ on the right side of this piece saw carved bafs relief in white marble ex-\ hibiting an emblem over the foregoing this bass relief appeared in niche run-\ ning towards the point of fight on some high steps roma was on her right knee and lifted up by valour her breast was fronting and her head turned little\ backwards towards the left shoulder her right ari hung down just touching the\ steps with the tips of the fingers her left elbow stood out towards the left side in the hand whereof she held an hanging slappet of her garment the left foot far srom the fteps rested on the toes seeming by the rise of the hip and- the\ knee keeping down against the steps to pufh her up valour was represented tur-\ ning its upper parts fideways towards roma supporting her elbow with its right\ hand the arm whereof being faint in the ground its head was in profile and the left arm guarded with shield little drawn back it stood somewhat like\ the known statue of apollo supported on its right leg the left faintly uniting with\ the ground little further albania was on her knees quite bowing her body she was decked as an heroine with an helmet in the form of town-wall on her\ head and laid with the left hand staff down on the ground holding the other af\ her breast her left knee was upwards with the foot drawn in and she looked\ down with dejected countenance behind her stood fate yoking her shoulders and she at the same time pointed backwards with the-right hand at some trophies\ which hung on pikes and united faintly with the ground this goddess of fate\ was dressed like an old matron in her girdle stuck pair of scifssors her under\ parts were seen sideways and the upper from behind with her eyes fixed on roma-\ under the aforesaid trophies the horned tiber god lay with his left arm resting on\ large vafe and holding in his right hand an oar behind his right side he lay\ on his left side with the breast turned against the light the left leg was stretched\ out yet faintly rising the right hip upwards and the thigh seen only to the\ knee rested on the other leg the residue united with the ground behind his.\ back the she wolf and parts of the two children were seen above him appeared\ some columns as of portico running towards the point of sight which as on\ the other side were half lost in the ground victory flying between roma and va-\ lour held in her right hand crown of laurel over the head of the former and\ with the left-putting into her hand scepter topped with little globe her gar-\ ment was flying behind her and her legs quite extended without any fore-shorten-\ ing faintly united with the ground in the shield of valour was represented the\ combat of horatius with the ceratii and on her helmet crowned with oak leaves was lion\'92 head and the same on her buskins this work was inclosed between\ two young palm trees not much leaved.\ the triumph on account of the mournful accident so much affected me that\ remained in suspence not knowing for fear of miserable issue whether might turn to the following piece nevertheless considering the bravery of ho-\ rattus\'92 exploit whereon depended the power of rome took heart in hopes of\ his preservation which found agreeable to the writer\'92 relation.\ horatius then was secured for the murder of his sister and according to law fentenced to be put to death yet in consideration of his heroic action pardoned on condition that his father paid as fine certain sum of money into the pub-\ lic treafury the picture as remember was thus\ second picture.\ at the capitol justice or the roman law sat in raised chair with the scales in-\ her left and pole-ax in her right hand in one scale lay sword and in the\ other crown of laurel with palm branch this latter far over balancing the\ other scale as token that the law is mitigated by mercy the criminal stood\ very\ very dejected before her with his hands ironed behind him on her left fide the father on his knees was offering vessel of money at her feet on her right\ stooil mercy with-holding the hand wherein was the pole-ax and with the other\ pointing at picture held by some children representing the decayed roman do-\ minion restored by the valour of horatias further were seen the arms of the\ three slain brethren planted there by himself round the statue of roma whereon\ justice had fixed her eyes another child crowned with laurel was loosing the\ fetters of the accused with one hand and putting on his helmet or setting up the\ cap of liberty with the other on each side of the throne was bafs relief and\ over them two niches in that on the right side was represented numa pompilius and in that on the left lycurgas two of the most ancient legislators the bafs\ relief under numa exhibited the example of charondas who to enforce his law stabbed himself in full senate for having acted contrary to it and under lycurgus that of seleucus when for his son\'92 sake who by law had forfeited his eyes he\ caused one of his own to be put out so strict were the ancient romans in support\ of their laws over the throne hung two tables containing the roman laws written in greek letters of gold.\ this unexpected event much rejoiced me wherefore full of desire went to\ third picture in order to observe on what basis so great work was built and\ found it as follows.\ jullus hostilius chosen by the roman people for their third king on account of\ his great ability and merit invaded the alban territory though stout people and\ bearing much sway in ltaly these weakened by many battles at last agreed.\ with the romans toend the dispute by combat between three brothers on each\ side those of the romans were named horatii and of the albans curatii the\ fight was glorious yet doubtful but at last fortunate for the romans for one of\ the horat after having lost his two brothers mistrusting his strength against\ three such brave enemies added policy to his courage and by an artful sleight slew the three curatii one after another and thus got the victory.\ third picture.\ here appeared the place of combat fenced in on the right side was seen the\ general of the roman forces and on the other at distance he of the albans both sitting somewhat high with their bages of distinction in the middle of\ the piece horatius was represented turning tail to the last of the curatii but re-\ turning he run his pursuer through the breast whereupon he fell backwards.\ the second little from thence was on his knees with his face to the ground and all bloody bearing up little on his elbow he lay about the middle of the\ fence against post whereon stood the figure of fate or fortune in copper.\ just beyond this post lay the third stretched out on his back \'92 and at the end of\ the pailing were seen the two dead horatii over the valiant heroe victory\ shewed herself with the left hand crowning him with laurel and with the right holding\ holding out cap and staff to the chief of the romans who thereupon joyfully\ came down from his seat with the acclamations and clappings of the people.\ opposite stood the chief of the contrary party astonished and turning his back in order to go away the people withdrew in tumult at the sound of the romqu\ trumpets leaving the field-badges in the place on the right side behind the\ romans appeared part of the town-wall and on the other behind the albans up to\ the wall the field full of tents on low ground over the roman arbiter or\ umpire was seen romulus and romus cut in large stone the field-badge of\ the albans was dragon or harpy in the off-scape appeared the tiber and the\ alps always covered with snow.\ thus was the plan of this artful piece which thought no less wonderful\ than the others in force and disposition as well as naturalness every thing was\ exactly observed the paffions and motions so well expressed the place so piainly\ apparent the quality of the by-works so proper and the lights shades colours so advantageoussy distributed that could scarce believe it picture.\ could not but admire the three remarkable divisions of this story as first the\ beginning happening without the town secondly the sequel seen within the\ town and lastly the end of the story or what was tranlacted in the capitol without any thing of moment intervening from whence painter could make\ picture speak with respect to the different matter which opportunely offers\ to the thoughts and execution of judicious master.\ as the sense of the story is very particular so the three pictures were as ex-\ cellent from first to last in the first we perceive the lucky chance of arms or\ the valour of the heroe whereby he gained the repute of deliverer of his\ country in the second we consider him as murtherer or the accident as bloody triumph and him elated with his success and in the third we see him\ malefactor condemned to be put to death or one who had transgressed the laws.\ truly those three events may serve for instructive examples to all men do\ we not see in them the common course of the world and that too great success\ and prosperity make many men proud and insolent and what do not their\ blind pafsions lead them to certainly unthankfulnefs to heaven is the prelude\ to many disasters and errors leading them into the greatest dangers however all things are governed by providence.\ the middle of the cieling had large oval piece wherein providence was in the greatest depth represented sitting on globe drest in gold stuff with her\ head crowned and about it twelve glittering stars having in her right hand\ sceptre with an eye on top on her breast sun and on her knee holding\ looking glass with her left hand her look was full of majesty and authority she pointed downwards at roma who sat little to the left side on cloud attended by religion valour and concord long life healih and prospe-\ zily came gently waving down towards her long life was beautful virgin\ in her prime with flame of fire on her head and serpent with the tail in\ its mouth in her hand health was asculapius holding staff about which\ twined serpent prosperity appeared naked vouth crowned with laurel with\ cornucopiae full of fruit under his arm retigion or piety was drest like vestal\ vestal holding in her right hand cup emitting slame and looking up\ at providence valour was represented like an hercules with his club and lion\'92\ skin concord looked somewhat more composed than piety having in her arms bundle of rods which cupid tied with red ribbon roma drest in white\ or light blue under purple robe embroidered with gold held in her right\ hand pike and in the left laurel branch on her head she had an helmet and buskins on her legs.\ now we ought to weigh the meanings of these things providence is to\ be considered as the chies ruler of worldlv affairs debasing and raifing empires\ as she pleafes the three gifts of long life health and prosperity are bleffings\ flowing from her the corporeal virtues are the effects of might whenee they\ proceed the first is religion the second valour and the third concord these established roma in her power and increased it in relation to art let\ us observe with what ingenuity and uncommonnefs the master has executed\ those pictures say uncommonness since never saw them handled by any\ other after such manner first providence is in the greatest depth and according to guefs thrice as big as the life the three gifts which sne sends\ down being somewhat lower are not half so big and the undermost to wit roma and the characters accompanying her are still smaller yet somewhat\ larger than the life-\ providence has no bounds always maintaining her uncontrolled power with-\ out diminution and though the three gifts which slow from her are but small\ parts yet with respect to the undermost figures they are much bigger and\ keep among them their own forms as reigning over them the three others\ on the undermost clouds being but corporeal virtues are therefore much smal-\ ler than the preceeding and appeared with less majesty nevertheless roma\ excels and shews herself bigger intimating thereby her growth and improve-\ ment her sitting on clouds implies in my opinion her rising above all\ other powers of the world.\ this would be monstrous design if art with respect to perspective were\ not duly observed but by this means the piece looked so perfect that judged it could not otherwise be good for the undermost group as quite low was very strong the middlemost according to its distance somewhat fainter and the uppermost very faint and almost imperceptible.\ this emblem bears mysterious interpretation and may in general be\ applied to all the governments in the world provided the figure of roma be\ altered and another substituted as things require instead of asculapius we may\ represent health by the figure of woman and in the place of hercules the\ fame taking for valour an heroine holding an oaken branch in her right\ hand with lion on her fhield.\ in treating formerly of this sort of fables we have called them emblema-\ tical carrying mystic sense whether they be mundane or spiritual however as distinction between boch and to shew that this is mundane and historical we must observe that it is not intermixed with any emblematic figures which\ have spiritual\ sense except those of asculapius and hercules which therefore\ in this work reject as unfit and only-proper for poetic and fabulous sub-\ jects jects as if instead of roma were introduced troja or aging which are do-\ minions no where now subsisting but in the poetic writings we find that this\ emblem like its subject is not only mundane and heathenisn as the story\ of horatius proves but that therein is also exprest the force or mysterious sense\ by those heathenisn figures.\ now if it be afked why this cieling piece does not allude to the person of\ horatius as that in the tenth chapter to hercules my opinion is that the con-\ clusion of the story so far as it respects him is contained in the second picture for here we can not expect any deification nor do the gods interfere in the\ matter they regard only those who are reckoned in their number such as\ aeneas hercules memnon and others of godly race.\ ch ap xiii the fable of calisto adapted to the corinthian\ order in the upper-story.\ am delighted to relate here in four pieces the wonderfully embellished\ story of calisto and her deification as not unworthy in my judgment to\ adorn so fine an apartment as this last which was of the crinthian order and\ very magnificent as well with respect to the extraordinary thoughts as their\ artful turn the conclusion whereof renders this work most perfect.\ the first piece was as follows.\ calisto tired with hunting went to repose in the shade of the trees jupiter\ enamoured with her came to delude her in the shape of diana and gratified\ his paffion notwithstanding all her efforts to the contrary.\ there on the right side of the piece on an eminence the innocent creature\ was sitting under the trees not at rest but full of concern shame and dread melted into tears with her hand on the edge of fountain her tresses half\ loosed hung carelesly over her naked shoulders her chaste bosom was above\ half bare and her legs uncovered to unseemliness sufficiently shewed her sor-\ rowful fate jupiter the author of it was seen little off next the middle of\ the piece above the horizon not as disguised or pretended diana but the\ chief of the gods shining with majesty with his diadem on his head and in\ his purple robe not as thunderer with lightnings and tempests but only\ attended by his eagle the cruel and degenerate lover seemed to deride her\ forrow having his left hand up at his breast as if he meant that he had got\ his will wherefore penetrating the clouds he advanced through the air for-\ saking the miserable woman the unmerciful incendiary cpid was extin-\ guishinghis torch in the fountain looking at jupiter who with his pointing\ sceptre commanded him to do so diana was seen in the off-scape in valley with her retinpe of nymphs the landscape was delightful and woody here\ and there appeared some river gods behind calisto among the trees stood term of priapus in shades attentively viewed the aforesaid three figures and\ reflected to myself how well they acted their parts clearly opening the matter even to th\'e9 very term which though it might be placed there accidentally yet\ second\ the unhappy calisto bemoaning her misfortune and full of shame and fear and discarded by her mistress was seeking shelter in solitudes yet the jealous\ juno spyed and found her there.\ on the left side of the piece appeared the superior goddess of heaven glittering coifed with peacock\'92 feathers instead of diadem or royal head\ ornament and seeming to turn about as she was stepping on eloud in or-\ der to go upwards she was dressed in her blue garment and held her sceptre\ in her right hand on the right hip charging hellish rage or revenge which\ attended and was at her back to punisn the innocent calisto and lifted up\ her left arm and the fingers streight up she with severe and envious look reproached the oppressed creature with lying with her confort revenge was\ beating with serpents and adders besides her smoaking pitch-torch the mi-\ serable calisto who now had no more of her former shape except her cloaths which fell prey to the hellisn fury there lay the quiver here the bow yonder the girdle as conceived it was she-bear who shook off those cloaths and was taken to flight being now metamorposed into so frightful monster by the immoveable jealousy of juno she in her flight looked up to heaven feeming by her bellow to move jupiter to piety this landscape was also dark wood filled here and there with sleeping river-gods among the trees ap-\ peared some wild beasts running about and lion in bottom on the right side\ near rock drinking at river up and down arose some palm and other trees.\ after this piece another presented the subject whereof was this.\ arcas son of the deluded and now metamorphosed calisto was fifteen years of\ age when according to his custom going hunting he met with frightful sne-\ bear which came towards him not to hurt him as he thought but if poffible to make herself known to him vet ignorant that she was his mother stoutly pre-\ pared to shoot her.\ jupiter from heaven seeing this in pity hindred the\ matricide.\ third picture.\ here on the right side of the piece arcas appeared gently stepping forth from\ behind some trees and putting an arrow into his bow in order to shoot his\ mother unknown to him in that shape but mercury slying down suddenly with-held his arm at whom he therefore looked back the celestial messenger\ staring behind at the she-bear which was on the second ground intimating with\ his staff in his left hand that she should take to flight which she seemed to do fhie stood upright with her under-parts towards him and the upper turned to\ the left swaying towards the road the way she took was apparent beginning\ from her feet like dust or thin vapours altering by degrees into clouds which\ ran winding about her and at last mixed with the air wherein jupiter appeared yet very faint and almost imperceptible in the clouds by him on his right\ sicle but somewhat lower and more forward sat the three fatal sisters of whom\ clothe\ cotho was spinning the thread lachests winding it on the reel and atropos ready to\ cut it which jupiter observing laid his left hand on the scifsors holding up his\ sceptre in the other with his mouth little open she surprised at this turned\ towards him arcas stood astride with his breast projecting behind him on\ and near stone lay some game as an hind fox hare together with gar-\ ment which judged to be his low against the said stone lay river-god with\ his vase this landscape was woody like the others the she bear about the\ middle of the piece appeared in the shade against the light off-scape on the\ left side on the second ground or at the extremity of the first was ruined tomb with some cypresses and behind on further ground arose large rock.\ after this was curious to view diligently the cieling-piece as the concllusion\ of this artful work and found it thus jupiter affected with the sorrowful fate of calisto does notwithstanding juno\'92.\ hatred glorify her with the radiant brightness of the north-star which among the\ constelations is named the great bear and is followed by the little bear into.\ which her son arcas was transformed.\ fourth picture.\ underneath in the piece the youth was seen flying upwards pursuing his mo-\ ther with bow and arrow and supported by some cupids he appeared back-\ wards without any fore-shortening with his right arm with the arrow extended\ and the other with the bow behind having quiver by his fide jupiter some-\ what above him on the right side sitting on cloud and large-fized was with\ an erect sceptre shewing him the zodiac wherein particular bright star appearedt\ very ghittering the bear was seen rifing little beyond the said star looking\ back upwards and being encompassed with great shining light in the shape of star which enlightened the whole piece her hind paws rested on the clouds which beside her from jupiter off to the left fide rose under her quite on\ the left side sat juno on the rainbow looking envioussy at artas she leaned her-\ head on her left hand with the elbow on the rainbow and lay half turned to the-\ right her under parts inclining towards arcas and the upper fromhim her right\ arm and sceptre crossed her body at her feet on the clouds lay some water-\ gods and goddesses as sub-directors of the clouds and dew behind her stood her-\ peacock with its tail so spread as seemingly to serve for diadem lris appearedt\ looking upwards behind her with an hand over her eyes to shade them from the-\ beams of the star diana and apollo sat behind her juno and those sitting be-\ neath her were shaded by the driving clouds above diana apollo and otners looked smilling jupiter appeared directly in the light of equal height with the-\ juno was- little lower and the river-gods and arcas beneath her he was.\ bear.\ youth of small size receiving his light from the star above.\ thus the work concluded with the deification of the unhappy calisto second.\ time metamorphosed it would be troublesome to rslate all the particulars of it and.\ and needlefs to the knowing wherefore ishall only subjoin the general dispofi\'ac\ tion ofthe lights and shaded parts japiter and arcas were strongly.lighted against\ the blue of the sky on the right side juno contrarily on the left side where the\ star was dark the foremost water-god under juno received little light from\ above holding his hand over his eyes.\ animadver sion.\ this fable clearly stews how beautiful bodies are polluted by uncleannefs for\ in fhort time after calisto was delivered of her son arcas juno transformed her as punishment of her unchastity into she-bear beast so deformed as to be\ reckoned among monsters the aforesaid evil has such direful effects that the\ fruit or children of unlawful love mortally hate their guilty parents foi-beauty\ stained with unchastity is of no account in the eyes of the virtuous and what be-\ fore created wonder is now mark of infamy ovid in an elegant and artful\ manner assigns calisto notable place in the northern hemisphere and shews ju-\ no\'92 intreating thetis that those stars according to the belief of the heathens might\ never refresn themselves in the sea in order to pourtray wonderfully her eternal\ shame as surpassing the other capital stars and having such station near the\ northern pole that as this pole or point of the axis is above our horizon this\ star whatever course it takes can never be out of our sight and therefore her\ crime be as little out of our memories.\ but more christian-like inference may be that the polluted soul abhorring her\ crime by true repentance gained most glorious and shining aspect besides fixed station in the heavens setting an example to others like mary mugdalen whofe crimes through repentance were not only expiated but by an incorrup-\ table glory intirely blotted out.\ the truth of this story taking off the poetic mafk is that arcas son of jupiter\ and the nymph calisto taught the arcadians who pretended to be the most ancient\ people of the earth nay older than the moon as plurarch intimates in his gzd roman questions boasting to be sprung from the earth and therefore\ made great account of the oak and beech-trees and their fruit after king pelasgus\ had taught them to make it their food which before was only herbs and roots to till the ground and sow corn which knowledge he learned of triprolemus son\ of cres and afterwards to make bread of it also how to weave woollen cloths\ for covering their bodies likewise inuring them to many civilities in acknow-\ ledgnent of which benefaction and in honour to him they named their country\ arcadia which before was called pelasgia as pausanias in his arcadia testifies.\ ch ap xiv description of the inward view of the temple of\ apollo.\ we hhave before in treating of painter-like beauty described the outside of\ this temple we shall now according to promise shew the inside of it stepping into the portico saw over the door of the entrance carved lyre whence inferred that this edisice was sacred to apollo going into it was\ transported with the sight of all the fine things so artfully worked and of such\ rich materials.\ in the middle stood the figure of the god on high pedestal at the four angles\ of this pedestal sat the four seasons each holding an horn silled with the particu-\ lar fruits and flowers of the scasons all these were of beautiful plain white\ marble the figure of apollo was naked crowned with laurel and holding sceptre in its hand.\ the floor was inlaid with variety of costly stones in the form of terrestrial\ globe in the center whereof stood the aforesaid figure.\ the arch-work was azure blue but could not certainly perceive it to be mo-\ faic it was adorned with the seven planets and other constelations all in gold.\ near the windows between the two pilasters were niches silled with figures each\ representing one of the months of the ycar they had the form of young men and\ were cut in whitish marble.\ the whole building consisted also of marble but not so fine as that of the\ figures for here and there under the niches in the mouldings and about the\ windows it was veiny in basement running round the temple was carved continued bass relief the figures ofit were about four feet high and of fine white\ stone the other inside division was the same as we have already described it to\ be without the undermost part being composed of the lonic order the middle-\ most of the roman and the upper of the corinthian.\ over the sirst cornices appeared terms instead of pilasters these represented the\ hours and with their heads supported the cupola they were inthe shape of young\ virgins to the number of twenty-four it would be tedious to describe them and their badges of distinction singly and the rather since caesar ripa has so\ handsomely done it.\ next took notice of the orderly disposition and proportion which was ju-\ dicioussy observed throughout the building for apollo\'92 figure was as guessed eight feet high and those about him seven feet and an half the young men re-\ presenting the months were seven feet and the terms for the hours six or six and\ half this proportion not only seemed so large but the imagined height really\ appeared to me to be such without abatement for distance as seen from under-\ neath reflecting on this neatness ithought it strange for people of sense nay great\ great masters to agree that large window should come over small one or giant be set above young child and how such things should look becoming.\ the undermost bafs reliefs consist of smaller figures than those in the upper work not without reason for the walling wherein they stand as well as that figure-\ work bear throughout the building nevertheless he who duly considers the\ matter and such sight will soon alter his opinion for since apollo or the sun is the largest of all created things and the chief of the universe observed by the\ heathens by his quality among irrational creatures as the father of the four sea-\ sons he is the biggest and principal figure the four seasons brought forth by\ him are somewhat less and the months inferior to them in bigness to which the\ hours must give way again because twenty-four of them make but one natural\ day we ought also to observe that the four seasons are of more composed\ countenance the months reprefent young men still growing and the hours shew\ nimble virgins.\ is not this division very elegant with respect to architecture since every thing\ keeps its relation and property good architect employs his thoughts about\ all those particular objects in the compartion ofhalls and apartments according\ to which good master ought to accommodate himself in the painting of\ buildings.\ th ari of painting\ book\ ix.\ of the painting of cielings or plafonds.\ chap of cieling-painting in general.\ among all the parts of painting none is so difficult as that of\ than an upright piece on wall or over chimney this is owing to\ ignorance and an indifference in some people what their cielings\ are daubed with so as they be but quickly finished dazzle the eye\ and cost little formerly they were contented with foliage slightly painted for\ saving expence and that in places of consequence only whereas now according\ to the present state of the painters and times they can have other things for the\ same price and the painter making no great matter of it they lay hold of the\ opportunity causing the whole cieling to be silled with histories and emblems whether they be suitable or not.\ we sce that all things from small beginnings improve and at last come to per-\ fection through the industry of judicious artists even so it is in painting for remember to have se\'ebn many cielings with figures landscapes sea-fights battles without any fore-shortening as if painted on an upright wall and others\ which were represented from underneath more or less and yet withojf fore-\ shortening as also some which fore-shortened but had no point of sight whence\ it is evident that without regard to perspective such pieces can not possibly be\ brought to the aforesaid perfection now for order sake let us examine into\ the name of this branch.\ the word plafond is french and signifies flat or level superficies fit to be\ covered with boards or cloth whereon to paint or plaister such representations or\ ornaments as we think proper consisting mostly of histories with flying figures skies with birds flowers and many other things but the true sense of the word\ plafond imports cieling of halls apartments temples or galleries even\ all that hangs over head and is parellel with the ground such pieces are called\ opticat because they must be viewed from an assigned distance without which they ainavoidably appear mis-shapen as we shall hereafter shew.\ in the matter itself we ought to consider the nature of plafond or cieling\ painting and wherein it differs from wall painting as first in the fore-shorten-\ ing of the objects and secondly in the colour speak with respect to the objects\ contained in one and the other such as buildings balustrades figures and other\ things occurring in ordonnances all which in an hanging picture retain their\ perfect heights and breadths shortening in thickness only whereas in plafonds or cielings neither height measure nor proportion are to be observed in word every thing foresshortens except the bafis and the cap or top what is round re-\ mains so and what is square keeps its angles whether in the middle in profile high or low as for the colours they doubtless must also differ much from those\ of hanging pictures for they ought to appear more beautiful not only in the\ light but affo in the fhades mean in clear light as we may eafily appre-\ hend.\ we ought moreover to know that by means of optics or practical perspective we can make crooked things look strait hollow or rising ones flat and even and\ cause them outwardly to appear what they really are not as the famous niceron\ and others have plainly demonstrated wherefore we need not wonder that so\ few painters excel in this branch of the art since they are little conversant with\ the practical part of perspective though without it it is impossible to execute good cieling-piece it is certain that many painters are rash enough to undertake\ such piece of work and sometimes they happen to perform good things for\ laboriousness and daily practice often contribute much nevertneless they do not\ inquire whether their methods be the shortest or longest commonly chusing that\ which first offers drudging witheut certainty and led by meer chance.\ chap ii of the usual difficulties in cieling-painting.\ irst we are at great stand because we can not use the life either in the\ nudities or flving draperies though they be the principal objects.\ secondly because we can not without great trouble find the true and certain\ places of the figures we introduce for which reason they must mostly be done\ by guess.\ thirdly because we can not duly view the work as long as it is on the easel.\ whence lastly it follows that the master is always in pain for the effect of the paint-\ ing in being fixed in its place.\ these difficulties are not little vexatious even to one who understands his\ business for it is otherwise with those who make more use of their hands than\ careful than others paint as many cielings as you please as long as you do not\ believe that there are grounds and rules for it and remain in this ignorance you\ will never surmount the aforesaid difficulties the most skilful master is often at\ loss in this part of painting let us then in the first place learn perspective and\ what it shews us since thereby only we may arrive at this laudable study which\ otherwise is impossible.\ chap iii of fore-sbortening objects in cielings.\ vt is-obvious that the off-scape in common picture is the part which retires\ or goes off from us leffens and grows faint and that the horizon is an utmost\ distance limiting our sight.\ contrary in cielings our off-scape and boundary of sight is the firmament or\ starry sky whereby objects the higher they are lessen the more even to insensi-\ bility not only in their proportions and neatness but also in their colours.\ here we ought to observe that all objects of what shape or form soever keep\ their due breadth provided they are parallel with-the horizon for instance placc\ square stone so as to be viewed directly against it or figure in the same manner.\ here you see that the top and bottom\ in plate lxi we exhibit square body of the said stone keep their squares and that the upper and under corners of it fall\ perpendicularly from the point of sight moreover that however the said square\ is turned thetop and body always make right angle and consequently the\ hindermost extremity is parallel with the foremost it is the same with figures of\ other objects.\ place for instance man on one or other side of the piece standing up-\ right and the point of sight in the middle let him be in profile and have both\ his shoulders of equal height and you will then perceive that the shoulders from\ one to the other keep to their full breath and their figure its full thickness from\ top to toe thus we see evidently that there is no other fore-shortening than in\ the length or to say better in the height and the more the figures or other\ objects rise and approach the point of sight the shorter and more mis-shapen\ they become because in their breadth they retain their measure and proportion as before has been said this is principal rule and ought alivays to be observed.\ as for buildings boss\'e9 gives full precepts touching them in the latter part\ of his book of perspective vet have room to say that when we would place\ columns over columns for galleries we ought to draw rising line through their\ centers from the basis or ground to the point of sight even through each balis-\ ter and thus find the due proportion of their heights as well as the breadths by\ the help of gradation line.\ this with respect to proportion must likewise be observed in designing figures\ and other objects as shall hereafter shew by examples.\ this fort of painting is not only the most artful but also the most difficult as\ have before said because although we understand the rules and practice of it it appears nevertheless disagrecable and deformed which no one can be \'e0 judge\ of but the master himself unless it be put up in its proper place and seen at\ the due distance.\ chap iv of the sizes of cieling figures.\ he figures which we paint in cielings ought not to exceed the common\ size of man to wit six feet and an half when they are so low as to be\ even with the cieling but being higher and sitting on clouds or flying they\ must lessen and go off as perspective teaches yet we may represent the deities\ as big aswe pleafe provided they be not painted with more strength than other\ figures it even sometimes happens that when they almost vanisn out of sight thev have yet human bigness.\ eun-shine is the most proper and agreeable in spiritual representations.\ as for the glory of each deity in particular they keep it when they appear to\ men but when they are represented in heaven it is mixture of many smaller pro-\ ducing one great fhining to do this artfully is not matter of the least conse-\ quence and he is great master who instead of dark thick and heavy clouds\ like wool-sacks places his figures on thin transparent and almost inseniible va-\ pours.\ it will not be improper in this chapter to mention something of flying figures\ in the air.\ though the air be seldom without wind and this may always be somewhat\ perceived it is nevertheless not advisable to make it appear in cielings because if the wind were stirring the sigures slying before it would seem to be motionless and contrarily those which are sitting or standing shew as much violence as the\ slying ones for this reason no wind must come into the piece but what the ve-\ locity of each sigure causes that we may plainly see by what motion the drape-\ ries are slung as also the places the figures are going to or returning from one\ gently waving and the other nimble and swift.\ the different stuffs are very proper to this on such occasions and they very\ much conduce to express the matter as the ressexion of ruffling silks for waving\ figures\ figures and which are gently descending thin and sleazy silk for swift and down-\ flying figures and the most pliant or thick silk or stuff for sitting lying or stand-\ ing ones the secret and importance of fine stirring cieling piece lies chiesly\ herein.\ as for the making of the coloured stuffs of flying figures because they can not be put on the layman and therefore not painted after the life we can not lay\ down any rules about them nothing but good conception and natural judg-\ ment joined to continual practice and observation can bring the artist to per-\ fori it we must use these means and be perfect in them observing what\ stuff is most proper to the occasion as we have before intimated.\ we ought also to take dare that the thin stuffs be warm and transparent against\ that the flying figures never seem to be upright as if standing much less to be\ standing but always sitting kneeling lying or slying unless in the case of peo\'ac\ ple supposed to be on cielings or galleries who then are either standing stoop-\ ing or kneeling as the subject requires.\ let me say that we ought sometimes to make some additions to the disposition\ of the general and particular objects but with as much caution as possible that\ the inability of the artist and the deficiency of the work may not appear.\ chap method for viewing cieling-piece on the easel as if on\ the cieling.\ have already observed the difficulties arising in cielings with respect to\ the use of the life and in laying down rules subservient to it now had my sight should certainly find out some but since this is impracticable\ without figural demonstration and can not possibly verbally do it ishall never-\ theless shew some methods which though they may seem trifling have always\ been of service to me and of little trouble in their use.\ after sketching my ordonnance upon paper fixed it against low cieling then taking looking glass and sitting under it with ease exactly considered\ every thing observing what was wanting in it and thus marked and corrected\ faults as much as possibly could next drew each figure whether naked\ or cloathed after the life in such manner as shall hereafter be shewn then dcad-coloured my piece with such light as thought proper after this took\ the looking glafs again and held it over my head in order to view commodiously\ the piece standing behind me inclining little backwards on the easel as if it were\ against the cieling and casting my eyes every where first on the general design\ and then on the particular parts this examen repeated till by several correc-\ tions found that had brought the piece to my fancy here be mindful not\ to take too near distance to the end the glafs may take in the whole piece for\ for which reason sometimes got with the looking glass on chair or table and\ having my pallet and pencils in readiness and brought my piece into such for-\ wardness finished it without further looking back.\ will now for the service of those who may find it useful and necessary also\ treat chap vi of designing after the life for the use of cieling\ painters.\ te must not flatter ourselves that cieling painting can be performed with-\ out good knowledge in proportion since as has been said we can not conveniently make use of the life for how great soever your skill may be you\ will find difficulty enough though the life were before you to bring it on the\ eloth nevertheless to shew that it may be done and that have often used the\ life ishall for the service of those who are not sparing of pains lay down my\ manner of doing it.\ after had set the model whether of man or woman on an high place ac-\ cording to my sketch sat down on the floor with my back against the scaffold with looking-glass between my legs which moved and turned about so long till the model appeared in it in such manner as wanted according to my point\ of sight and then designing it on drawing paper as correct as possible painted\ after this design without any trouble.\ as for the dresses managed them in the same manner casting the garment on\ the layman accordirg to my sketch mean without slying which is thing im-\ possible and depends only on imagination then placed the layman thus dres-\ sed on an high tressel and sat down against it in the manner aforesaid and made\ design of the dress if it was flying or lying figure made shift with pack-\ thread wires or such like means as well as could sparing for no trouble when\ the matter was important and had mind to do something fine.\ used the same method in designing after all sorts of plaisters as faces vases urns ornaments capitals festoons of flowers in order to have them from\ underneath thus mastered the greatest difficulties occurring in this study.\ however did not this before my cloth was in readiness for it that might not\ mistake since notwithstanding all our care in some things especially upright\ standing objects we may easily be deceived.\ as to the preparation of the cloths for our design as likewise the dead-co-\ louring in order to sinish and thereby refresn our memories shall now treat of\ them.\ first six the point of sight either within or without the piece as my place\ of standing directs then strike with chalked thread from the said point as\ many lines over my piece as find necessary to serve all my upright standing ob-\ jects viz balusters columns pilasters figures which suppose to be per-\ pendicular pendicular also strike some diagonals or slope lines from that side of the piece\ whence the light comes either right or left parallel and equidistant from each\ other these put me in mind how high or low the light falls on my objects if\ they run parallel with the base the objects are lighted entirely from the side if oblique or sloping as before is said they lighten little fronting and if they\ fall from on high from the point of sight the light comes directly fronting as is\ visible in the examples numb in plate lxii.\ tthink myself obliged here to propose to the artist small practice of my\ own invention and in my opinion of little trouble but certain great advantage\ to-cieling painters fince we find that although there are certain rules yet they\ can not be put in use without the greatest trouble application and loss of time unless aided by some practice or other or by some artful instrument like astro-\ nomy which how demonstrative soever has its globe and astrolabe architec-\ ture its plan and level geometry the oval triangle square and compass\'e9s mathematics algebra but to return to my invention.\ first mould some wax puppets as we have shewn in the \'f4th chapter of or-\ wires some long others short whereon to stick the puppets and keep them\ from bending whether they be made standing lying slying or sitting this\ being done take an oblong wooden trough lined with tin of what bigness pleafe into the corners put some pins or serews to fasten cover of wood\ or tin fitting the trough and made full of little holes wherein to stick the afore-\ faid wired puppets and so as they may turn easily then ifill the trough with\ clay or kneaded bran and thus my machine is in readiness now when imake\ use of it stick my puppets bent and turned according to my design on the\ wires and through the holes into the clay where would have them one high another low one stooping forwards another leaning back as the subject\ requires which will then stand immoveable.\ my scheme being in this forwardness lean the whole machine back on ta-\ ble be the light left or right and then slightly design the figures in the manner\ have shewed with the lines can give the machine such light as desire either from afide fronting or from on high common sun-shine or candle-\ light.\ now for perfecting this sketch and conveniently painting after it set my\ layman with such dress as each figure requires in the manner before laid.\ down and then my cloth being ready proceed to painting.\ invented this machine in the vear and put it in use for about five years\ with great advantage and with such exact reflexion that afterwards had no fur-\ ther occasion for it though never used more than three or at most four pup-\ pets.\ now the curious artist must also know what observations lmade in the use of\ the machine.\ first as plate lxiii fhiews put one puppet coming directly down quite\ extended namely with the head and feet both on line and then ob-\ served\ served that there was not the least fore-shortening all the parts having their full\ lengths.\ second puppet set upright standing in profile on one side of the point of\ sight and found it fore-shortened in all its parts.\ third set stying upwards from behind forwards and perceived that the\ members fore-shortened somewhat more than those of the first and somewhat less\ than those of the second.\ fourth placed sitting with its upper parts upright the thighs parallel and\ the legs like the upper parts and observed that when it was quite in profile the\ upper parts and legs fore-shortened and the thigh kept its full length as it also\ did when in al front position.\ having made firm impression of these things in my thoughts ihad no fur-\ ther occasion for that method.\ we shall now say something chap vii of the colouring of slying figures.\ herein we must observe that in cieling-painting it is the same as in\ landscapes first we rub in the greatest light of the fky then all parts\ about it next the highest and most faint objects and then the lower and more\ near ones and in case balustrade be represented it must be the last the reason\ of this ihave shewn in treating of the dead-colouring of histories and landscapes.\ moreover as in fine landscape the sky principally governs all things and\ without it no proper distance can be given to the picture so it is the same in cieling-piece with figures slying through the air for it is impossible to make\ objects rise unless they have some communication with the air nor is it enough\ for objects going off higher and further from us to be painted fainter and fainter as in drawing or print but the colour must also be shewn and as the air is co-\ loured so must the objects partake of it imean in their shades for if the air be\ blue yellow or red the shades ought likewise to have mixture of blue yel-\ low or red.\ as to the light of the objects we must observe that of what colour soever it\ be it breaks and grows darker as it goes off even were the air as may sav snow-white it breaks by distance or air interposing the red becomes violet the\ yellow greenisn and the violet blue as the objects go off from us and approach\ the air they are darkened white becomes darker pale yellow the same and so\ on in other colours.\ something still remains to be remarked with respect to objects in the air viz.\ that since the air communicates light from all parts the broad shades can not possibly be so dark as in landscape or other parts but contrarily the dark\ touches will be so much the stronger all that is in shade ought to be lighter and\ seen more plain yet somewhat leis than in the light it must be likewise known that\ that round objects have no furface especially on the shaded side that is to say the out-line against the sky ought to unite and vanisn not quite scumbled away but made somewhat lighter on the edge as we have clearly demonstrated by the\ example of globular body book chap implying that such works in the\ air differ from others to wit that the objects against the sky are more rounding\ and going off.\ chap viii general observations in painting the cielings of halls galleries .\ he first and principal observation on these occasions is that the quality and\ regularity of the architecture be firmly preserved in all its parts.\ the second observation concerns the grandeur of the architecture as being\ the main matter painting in this case is only to be considered as an aid to\ accomplish it with less charges wherefore such care must be taken that the\ painter\'92 designs do not mar those of the architect but that both unite in such manner as to induce the eye to take every thing for truth itself.\ by the first observation that the architecture ought to preserve its regularity we give to understand that the structure of the room must chiefly be regarded\ by the painter in his cieling pieces so as not to be hurt by making openings where\ they ought not to be for it is not allowable to make them every where as big\ or little as we please the cieling must remain cieling all that is without the\ painting as the summers ought to have their proper thicknesses and be lasting for instance let us suppose the cieling divided into three pannels lined with cloth one next to the windows the second in the middle over the chimney and the third\ to be next the wall that in the middle is between two summers one foot in and\ the two side ones lie almost flush with the under parts of those summers now\ if the two side cloths be like the middle one adorned with sky and the thicknefs\ of the summer which is one foot not painted on the cloth the cieling on those\ sides is so much weakened or at least seems to be so and is heavier in the\ middle contrary to architecture whereas to make it look natural and according\ to order the ponderosity must in this case be on the sides and the middle part\ lightest that it may not seem to be falling on our heads moreover we ought\ to observe that there must be but one opening and that in the middle since\ there is but one point of sight and but one place of standing to view the work\ to advantage as for painting the thickness of the summer only faid it to\ rectisy mistake often committed when cieling is made all over open and in-\ stead of covering nothing is left but grate which can not be justified some\ think it may pafs for lantern but they are mistaken for lantern rises and cieling lies flat moreover the whole cieiing can not serve for lantern because of\ the\ the windows in front the principal or middle piece must predominate and of\ consequence be open and the others closed mean not to have any sky or living\ creatures but bass-reliefs foliage compartments or flowers all of such co-\ lour as suits with the apartinent this judge to be the first and principal care\ and study of good cieling-painter before he sets about the work for in the\ division of cieling it is as with diamond the largest and most valuable is set\ in the middle and round it the less and less.\ as to the second observation that the art of painting is aiding to architecture and enriches it at less expence the point is plain wherefore shall proceed to\ shew the reason why the one may spoil the other.\ in painting divisions it often happens that the summers have not proper rests\ to lie on especially when the cieling is covered all over and the summers hid with single cloth and left to the judgment of an ignorant painter who then\ without consideration divides it into three four six eight or more pannels and\ these parted by painted summers which do not bear on any thing now to\ prevent this vou must let each summer rest on discharger pilaster or car-\ touche as architecture teaches for instance were you to divide the two pannels\ next the windows and wall each into two parts in order to have four pannels this would be improper and against architecture because of the flatness over the\ window unless it were compass-headed and then it would not do without car-\ touche.\ if it be afked whether the division be painter\'92 business say it is so far\ as he understands architecture otherwise more proper for an architect at least it\ as to the work where the painting may disorder or be contrary to architec-\ ture it lies in the designs when they do not suit the building nor perfectly\ bear on foundations or have their proper weight by the foundation of the\ painting mean the apartment and by the weight of the design that what the\ painter intends to exhibit in his cieling piece be not too heavy and seem to press\ down the under parts the better to clear my meaning will suppose room\ to be twenty feet square now if second depth or upper room were to be re-\ presented the piers columns doors and windows thereof must needs accord\ with those of the under room and bear upon them and in the next place the\ course of orders ought exactly to be observed as architecture teaches that is to\ say the heaviest must be undermost first the tuscan next the doric then the\ jonic next the romon and lastly the corinthian and so upwards lighter and lighter which lthink is seldom observed and the reason is because the figures are some-\ times represented bigger than the life which necessitates the artist to proportion\ his by-works accordingly an unpardonable error and not at any rate to be jus-\ tified but ishall say more of this on another occasion and now pursue our pur-\ pose in cielings principal point is that the work rise and that its force unite\ with the life that is that the objects in the lower parts be not painted stronger\ than the fixed work as compartments bass reliefs and other ornaments which not being fore-shortened receive their light through the windows now it may\ be afked whether in case we were to represent an apartment above with the same\ light\ light as below the force of light and shade must not be the same and say it\ ought not because of the great difference between them as we may easily sup-\ pose in two columns set over each other receiving their lighr from one front the\ one from the undermost and the other from the uppermost windows here the\ upper base must have no more force than the under capital for were it other-\ wise it would seem to be nearer it would also not rise and consequently over-\ power the life it is here as in fine landscape where the fore-ground has the\ greatest force and the second and third are lefs and fainter in proportion as they\ go off it is the same with slying figures for the light weakens by their rising and the shades become as well as in room by the surrounding air weaker and\ fainter but the touches and shades keep their force.\ we have observed what is necessary to the stability and regularity of the ar-\ chitecture with respect to painting so that both may seem to be one body as\ we shall exemplify by the following fable out of ovid proposed here as pain-\ ter-like simile.\ salmacis and hermaphroditus two accomplished and agreeable young people introduce representing architecture and painting salmacis meeting hermaphro-\ ditus and imagining her happiness lay in the possession of so beautiful an object falls in love with him but finding repulse she invokes the aid of the gods and thereby obtains her earnest suit the young man not daring to resist the\ will of heaven gives up the cause and is by mercury whom we must observe\ here to be optics joined to her and thus of two bodies is made one fur-\ ther applications are needless since the simile sufficiently explains itself.\ now to continue our subject the following observations are at the beginning\ of the work chiesly necessary.\ first the condition of th\'e9 place.\ secondly the quality office and inclination of the owner and what subjects\ are proper thereto whether histories fables .\ thirdly the disposition of the subjects.\ fourthly how the subject is to be divided.\ first by the condition of the place mean the light of the room and in what\ manner it takes the cieling also into how many pannels the architect has di-\ vided the cieling and which is the principal that we may adapt our thoughts\ thereto in the disposition of the reprefentations as well as in the execution of\ them.\ secondly by the quality of the owner we must understand whether he be\ divine or lawyer philosopher or artisan and whether he incline to spiritual or\ moral general or particular representations that is such as relate to him or\ his family in particular or generally to any one who may live in the house after\ his decease according to which information we ought to chuse subjects suitable.\ thirdly how the subjects ought to be disposed namely what must be placed\ above in the air wherein as is said lies the soul of room-painting and what\ below as touching the body of it this we divide into spiritual and moral spi-\ ritual all that is governed by heaven and moral every thing that is directed\ by our judgment.\ fourthly how the subject is to be divided here the principal piece in the\ middle must shew either-the cause or rise of the story or the effect of it the\ next to it must exhibit the matter itself and that further off an appendix to\ or inference from it but to make this point plainer shall give an example.\ in the middle pannel place solomon before the ark of the covenant praying\ to god for wisdom and on each side represent surrounded with glory the\ gifts which god bestows on him as wisdom and riches flowing down and in\ the lesser pannels exhibit in bafs relief the corporeal virtues on this foot\ we may handle any thing or subject whatsoever and by having due regard to\ the aforesaid four particulars and well executing them such representation\ will certainly please every one even envy itself.\ hence we may sufficiently perceive how orderly we must manage wherefore\ it is no wonder that so few excel in cieling painting though it has rules as well\ as other studies but if these be not duly observed we can not gain the point he\ that sets up for good master must shew that he understands his art.\ if am afked whether think corregio cortona vovet and others who per-\ formed wonders in this branch have always so punctually followed the rules and so nicely regarded all the observations here laid down according to my ap-\ prehension answer that it would have been better if they had done it or else\ what say must as have shewed in foregoing chapter be owing to the ma\'ac\ chine with puppets which made use of for four or five years and afterwards\ laid aside for we ought first to have thorough knowledge of thing and then\ demonstrate it but am further of opinion that had the great masters per-\ fectly known the prescribed rules we should not find such great mistakes in\ their works as some now think there are nevertheless it is most certain that\ none are qualified for this judgment but those who have made it their practice for he who understands the rules and retains them in memory can always judge\ whether they be observed or not though not able to do it himself yet they\ who work only by guess and know nothing of grounds and rules are more\ unpardonable than those who are acquainted with them and do not use them though both blameworthy the one for his carelessness and neglect of learning and the other for his knowledge and neglect of using it.\ am very sensible that some will make little account of many things by\ me delivered as necessary but am in no pain for that if can but give\ satisfaction to curious reader.\ must own that in my juvenile years daubed some cielings but never flat-\ tered myself that understood the art so as ought because was then igno-\ rant that there were any certain grounds and rules nevertheless afterwards at-\ tained them by sometimes hearing others discourse about them and by the\ rules of perspective and by my own indefatigable application to so noble study insomuch that at last could sketch large and grand composition with more\ certainty and less trouble than formerly little one must on this occasion relate what course took.\ had in my room little jutty closet and when was to make an ordon-\ nance pinned my paper against the upper part of it and having candle\ in\ in one hand and crayon in- the other laid myself on my back and scratched\ my thoughts on the paper this found to be good method for preventing\ mistakes mean in the sketch now for the painting it also did it against\ the cieling yet not after such slight scratch for having made my sketch took out of the prints of vovet and others such actions and postures as were pro-\ per altering them either in the faces hands or folds of draperies more or less by guess as well as could thus made shift yet all was done against the\ cieling whereby you may judge what trouble had as well in finding things\ as afterwards in executing them which really was double work but when bet-\ ter informed sat commodiously at my easel he who proceeds with certainty\ has great advantage above others.\ chap ix method for drawing fore-sbortened buildings figures trees after the life.\ ince it commonly happens on nature\'92 denying her favourable affistance that we have recourse to our wits for means to supply the defect it was even\ my case in cieling painting after having given myself much trouble to no pur-\ pose and taken useless pains in order to design every thing after the life lat last\ found out the following method which has made me full amends it is very\ profitable in all places with low horizons as you will perceive in the use.\ suppose then for instance that am to make design of the stadt-house\ at amsterdam it is no matter if it were thrice its present height and this without\ looking up chuse station or distance of eight feet more or less from the\ building as occasion requires then take convex looking glass of about foot diameter to be bought at the nuremberg toy-shops and place it against the\ inside of my drawing-board or port-folio contrive it in such manner that it\ may either stand upright or leaning back according as would see things either\ from beneath or higher thus approach with the open port-folio and my\ back towards the object till the building tree appear as would have it and then design it from the looking glass on blue or white paper.\ this method is very convenient for drawing all sorts of large works in nar-\ row places or streets even view of twenty or thirty houses it is also useful to\ landicape painters in their country views they may take whole tracts of land with towns and villages waters woods hills and sea from east to west with-\ out moving cither head or eyes it is likewise proper for those who are ignorant\ of perspective.\ we must here also shew method for representing all sorts of fore-shortened\ flat-faced ordonnances whether pictures hangings or bafs reliefs against walls cielings or any where else either standing hanging or lying and that with cer-\ tainty according to perspective these are things which painters ofteen meet\ with in exhibiting rooms galleries gardens and other places and the method\ for\ for doing it though not attended with difficulty yet sometimes puzzles those\ who neglect it.\ have therefore chosen the example in plate lxiv which is the foundation\ of all fore-shortenings as well of apartments as cielings and the performance\ is as follows having made the scheme of room in perspective divide the\ height and width of the side wall where would have hangings or representa-\ tions of pictures into certain number of diminishing feet fetching the crofs\ lines from the point of sight and the perpendiculars from the plan or scale.\ now in this example we perceive four principal fore-shortenings for is\ the cieling side wall the floor da loose picture hanging forwards all\ four proceeding after one and the same manner from the point of sight as the\ middle part shews which is divided into squares to say more would be use-\ less and tedious to those who are in the least conversant with this art.\ chap of the harmony and union of colours in cieling pieces.\ lthough in the chapter touching the deities and their qualities we shall treat of the colours proper to them we must on this occasion say something previous and shew how the colours ought to be placed and han-\ dled in order to create perfect harmony.\ you must not herein by any means be known by flaring strong and glitter-\ ing colours am of opinion that on this occasion nothing suits better than\ the union of the colours because it is agreeable to the eye causes fine relief and contains something uncommon even supernatural and when pretend\ here that in cieling pieces you ought to use tender and weak colours even were\ they mostly fetched from white do not contradict my asfertion in former chap-\ ter to wit that particular colours are assigned to the deities according to the\ nature and meaning of each as red purple yellow blue green and even\ to be known by them without their usual tokens of distinction as phabus with\ sun diana with the moon mercury with his caduceus ceres with her ears of\ corn jupiter with the eagle juno with the peacock momus with his fool\'92 cap\ and bauble they who can give their pieces such an exprefsion are\ principally commendable and- the painting must look well nevertheless\ do not hereby confine the lightness and darkness of the colours whether they\ differ little or much from each other or whether they ought to be almost\ all white or light since the colours- may be beautiful be they ever so light.\ even were cieling piece to consist only of white and black light and shade it would have no less decorum nor be less valuable think it in this case to\ be much like print which though consisting only of white and black has\ yet its harmony and decorum when light and shade are well disposed against\ each\ each other and still more with the addition of proper colours and those thinly\ and transparently managed whereby it gets the property of picture.\ as the principal goodnefs of cieling piece lies in an artful disposition of the\ figures above each other so it is of no lefs consequence that the colours be\ well adapted thereto.\ will now give an instance in two pieces differing from each other in light\ undermost depth strongly set off in colour against the second which is little\ dark and the third is light against the dark blue of the sky in the latter\ which think the best on account of decorum the uppermost group is dark\ against light blue sky and the undermost by the force of light set off against\ the uppermost even were we thus to dispose three or more grounds or groups\ over each other it would look very decorous and each deity would nevertheless\ keep its proper colours yet less in force in proportion to the distance for when\ the uppermost group is set off against the light sky it causes wonderful go-\ off and the reason proceeds from the sky\'92 seeming to be infinitely higher which\ contrariwise can not be effected.\ if it be objected that supposing one of the principal figures in the uppermost\ group ought according to its dignity and the reasons laid down in the suiting of\ colours to have white drefs and therefore the aforesaid position will be over-\ thrown ldeny it for it will be helped by disposing some dark clouds behind which will preserve that garment in its force and make it have pleafing har-\ behind each other we have more largely handled this point and shewed its truth\ and decorum for dark against light can not advance with so much force as the\ light may against the dark because the light has greater strength in itself how-\ ever to put an end to point of so great latitude which by discourse can not be\ fully demonstrated shall conclude it with the great junius who in his third\ book of the art of painting says ee thus we see that artists in their works ereate shades or depths to the end\ that the parts to come out may approach with more force and seem to meet the\ eye of the beholder even without the picture let two parallel lines says lon-\ ginusk be drawn upon cloth with light and dark colours the brightnefs of\ the light will soonest strike the eye and seem to be nearest and little fur-\ ther quoting johannes grammaticus he says ee lf we paint board with white\ and black the white will always seem to be nearer and the black further off.\ therefore \'92\'92 continues the same author in his observation on this point ee the\ painters also make use of blackisn or darkish-brown colours when they are to\ represent the deep hollow of well cistern ditch bottomless pit or the like.\ but when on the contrary they will make any thing come out as the breasts\ of woman an hand held out or the feet of leaping or running horse they\ lay on both the sides sufficient shade of black and brown colours in order that\ these parts may by the neighbouring darkness be flung off from the picture with\ lively force.\ chap xi of the deities in sacred and profane history and fables and first of the difference between facred and profane representation.\ aving done with treating of cieling pieces thought it improper to\ aend this book and make new one of the following chapters because\ the matter has such connexion that we can scarce think of the one without\ falling presently on the other.\ it is certain that in common pictures the deities ghosts demi-gods angels virtues and other powers may likewise be introduced nay are even inseparable\ adjuncts but into cieling pieces where the upper part is the sky they must of\ necessity come because the major part of such representations relate either to\ their persons qualities or virtues.\ now duly to execute this representation of the deities the artist ought chiefly\ to be acquainted with the sacred and profane stories as well as with the poeti-\ cal fictions that he may learn from them the particular occcurrences and pro-\ perties peculiar to each person and rank of the deities or upper powers and re-\ present them accordingly for although imagination must in this point lend\ great assistance yet it is not safe for every man to rely eatirely thereon lest he\ should be deceived like the man whose neighbour dreaming that in cer-\ tain place was hidden great treafure and awaking and going thither found it by\ digging and carried it home he on this good luck laid himself down on an\ heap of poppies in hopes of the fame happinefs but after long sleep he\ awaked without any advantageous intimation from his dream contrarily found\ his pocket picked and thus at once was bereft of his hopes and the money he\ before had in possession this simile is too plain to need nearer application.\ judicious master must certainly be well exercised in the knowledge of the\ true conditions of the things he is to handle that he may not be thought an ig-\ norant for the truth can not be hidden with respect to the inventor where-\ fore you ought to take heed of mixing this truth with salse things especially\ in sacred stories or spiritual representations since there is so great contrariety\ between them that they can not be joined unless to shew the disagreement say they can not possibly be joined in order to express single meaning but will\ rather serve to confound weaken and mistake it except they be separately dis-\ posed the spiritual above in heaven and the worldly below on the earth.\ speak with respect to emblems for there is great disparity between pallas and\ the wisdom of god since the latter can not be attributed to any person and much\ less represented on the earth the same may be said of janus and providence.\ the heavenly and civil justice are also very unlike we must therefore note that the whole lconology or science of the heathenisn figures though formerly\ accounted heavenly has now no relation to the soul but to the moral virtues and\ merits of men.\ let us then enquire with reverence what are chriftian emblems and what\ profane or heathenisn using in spiritual representations nothing but what is pure\ and heavenly and in the worldlv all that is proper to them in order to gain the\ esteem both of religious and worldly persons.\ passage in scripture mentions the driving lucifer and his companions out of\ heaven whence we may plainly conclude that those monsters afterwards fell to the\ share of the heathen as no longer pertaining tothe faints but we do not find after\ that time any more such unruly spirits were expelled heaven wherefore we are\ not allowed to represent more such iiistances but in the case of men seen to\ battle the true faith things may be accompanied and represented with heathenisn\ emblems because as is faid the heathens gave themselves up to the devil the\ better by that means to express their error and shew the truth thus also driving\ them out of heaven.\ it is upon occasion likewise not improper or disagreeing with the pharisees\ or hypocrites but has greater weight in fictitious stories or parables nor\ can we without offence introduce other emblems than christian-like when they\ only tend to incite to salvation in which case we may represent angels or spi-\ rits to keep those hypocrites out of heaven.\ in true profane histories as the roman grecian and others this management\ would be improper but we may lawfully use hieroglyphic and other characters of which there is an infinity for instance by religious person white garment or an offering cup by cruel one tyger\'92 skin or dragon either on his helmet\ or shield it would be preposterous to place vestal virgin by numa pompilius in\ order to shew his religiousness or achiiles by alexander to express his valour or\ an hercules by milo and still more ridiculous to set an herrules by hercules to\ pourtray strength or fool by momas to exhibit solly it would fay be very\ ridiculous to explain ovid by emblems sceing he gives us nothing but emblems.\ this would be sceking light with light or enlightening darkness with dark\ clouds we want not another sun for expressing the\'92 sun\'92 light but these re-\ presentations and by-works must only tend to the exhibiting invisible things by\ visible objects.\ the more noble and lofty the things we are to represent the more valuable\ ought to be the emblems we chuse for them for instance in expressing the na-\ ture and quality of the deities we use young and chaste virginity \'e0 state in all\ ages accounted the most rare and valuable but in representing the paffions of\ men we make use of beasts or else inaniinate characters and objects for being\ of lower rank than the deities they must also bear lesser objects.\ if now it should be objected because represent eternity by serpent and the\ purity of the deities by lamb that this is contradictory to my own position believe with respect to the former that any person will be of my mind on fair\ consultation of the most ancient heathenisn representation of it and as to the\ latter scripture and chiesly the revelation of st. jjohin in niany passages exhi-\ bits the person of christ in the form of lamb and as the lamb of god now\ since all this has an hieroglyphic meaning why should- not be allowed to fetch\ my emblematical thoughts from so pure and rich fountain of wisdom thus deport myself with-respect to other fuch objects which represent some quality of\ the doity bur those of later inxention endeavour in \'92this cafe to avoid a as possible.\ moreover scripture in many places delivers itself in hieroglyphic terms comparing anger to bear bereft of its cubs meeknefs to lamb innocence to\ dove subtilty to serpent .\ chap xii disquisition touching the representation of the trinity.\ tany will think this fubject beyond the reach of what we have hitherto\ handled and inconsistent with art but am of contrary opinion for\ tender-hearted artist has on account of the many differences among christians reason to be in concern for this point since so many occurrences offer in scrip-\ ture where the aliighty is either acting in some form about mankind or is\ passing by as glory to make his presence known.\ the greatest part of christendom holland england and part of germauy ex-\ cepted allow with one accord the representation of the persons in the trinity as first god the father in the fhiape of an old man with long grey beard and\ hair secondly jesus christ as he appeared in his humanity and thirdly god\ the holy ghost in the shape of dove in which shape he descended on jesas\ cbrist at the time of his baptism.\ now if according to the letter of scripture were to represent adam and eve find it necessary to exhibit the creator of the world and maker of adam in\ vifible shape fince it is written that he made adam of the dust of the ground and breathed into him the breath of life- now he who is to make some-\ thing or breathe into something must humanly speaking have both hands and\ mouth.\ as scripture also commonly shews us an apprehenfive quality of- the almighty why should be more culpable for representing him under the same than under\ that of triangle surrounded with glory and containing some hebrew letters \'e0\ yet our divines are of opinion that this last is allowable but not the former.\ is not then the one figure as well as the other \'e0 or do the jewifh characters or the inanimate shape of triangle make any alteration besides thefe reasons does not picture tend as well to inftruction as well-\ digested speech wherein the orator in order to be understood is obliged to use\ figural way of expreffion by parables or as writing wherein we find the\ same method for understanding it since the aim of both is by the perception\ of the hearers to make their difcourses have an impreffion on their minds even\ the writing containing the matter does it not confist of letter-figures which by\ certain method of uaderstanding we comprehend for it is not the matter\ itself.\ think that the learned world and artists represent the first person of the\ trinity rather in the shape of man than of any other creature on good reasons for we learn from scripture that god created and made man in his own image and from the aucient fathers that man is an epitome of all that god created who is therefore called the little world fome even call man the master-piece of\ god we ought therefore if we will take some likeness from the creatures to\ express the almighty by the most perfect idea to be found in order to exhibit\ his perfection and thus to make the copy in the best manner like the original and the more as scripture in feveral\'92 places makes mention of the head eyes ears mouth lips armis feet hands and other members of god which things\ must not be understood in carnal and literal sense according to the opinions of\ some ignorant people who imagine god in-his nature to be like man that\ he sits in heaven on throne according to passage in isaiah the heaven is\ my throne and the earth is my foot-stool and as-in another place the same pro-\ phet says ee saw the lord sitting on an high throne and lifted up but in- figural\ and spiritual sense think then that painter has no nearer expreffions in such\ representations where god himself is acting than to exhibit his figure in an\ human shape as best agreeing with those likenesses we paint him aged in\ order to shew his majesty and wisdom which are more to be found in old age\ than youth and with sceptre and globe and circle of stars about his head to shew his omnipotence both in heaven and on earth but roman-catholics\ daily make additions.\ if- the scripture represent his godly person under mysterious sense why may\ not the artist be allowed to do the same do we not read in the revelation what is.\ mentioned of god in an human shape is it not plain enough or must it be ob-\ jected that this description is apocryphal but granting it the relation neverthe-\ less is not accounted heathenish any doubt which might arise from it does-\ not affect the point with r\'e9spect to shapes in an\'f4ther place we find that the\ high-priest hid himself that he might not behold the lord but the lord put-\ finger on his eyes till he was past by how can represent that paffage with\ out body or is it no fact the prophet isaiah says ee behold the name of the\ fire now to make this known to person who can not read and is deaf is it\ not more easy to do it by representation than by signs are we to make only mouth sending forth flame ls this so proper for such nian\'92 apprehension as\ whole figure moreover is not mouth likeness and figure as well as whole image what then are they pretending who allow one part of the crime and not the whole lf it be crime let it be intirely forbidden and if good or at least sufferable intirely allowed and performed nevertheless we must not\ how before these things mnch less worship them but the true god only who\ is thereby meant can we observe facrifice otherwise ls not that mysterious\ representation or in better terms figural demonstration when it is said ce the facrifice was burning upon the altar and the children of god were bow-\ ing before it praying beseeching and giving thanks in all submission scripture scripture in several places speaks of the appearing of god to men either\ really by the ministry of angels or in vision by dreams or by extafies there\ is so sine description of god under the shape of an old man in the seventh\ chapter of daniel that no artist can better represent it the same scripture also\ mentions several appearances of angels in human shapes for which reason the\ church in the second council of nice made no difficulty in allowing artists to do\ it and chiefly painters to represent god the father as kind loving old man and the angels in an human shape.\ it seems also that painter has the privilege to paint and represent inanimate\ things as living according to the ideas which scripture affords him and the\ spectator must not be offended when in some pictures he finds sacred subjects\ attended with poetical fictions for their better explanation on supposition the\ latter be impious are not the psalms of david solomon\'92 song the book of job and the revelation of st. john the divine all delivered under poetic figures not to speak of the parables besides mentioned in scripture.\ painters therefore are not blame-worthy for bringing in something that is\ heathenisn in order to clear the matter and especially if the fact happened in an\ heathenisn country thus the great raphael in his passage of the children of\ lsrael over jordan has represented the river under an human shape violently turn-\ ing the water back towards its source.\ as scripture often lays down such and the like things under some figural de-\ scriptions it gives painters full liberty to do the same fince in order to accom-\ modate itself to the weak apprehenfions of men it usually delivers many of the\ greatest mysteries under figures and parables as it speaks of the rivers in\ psalm xeviii also made no scruple in his picture of the finding of moses to exhibit\ the river nile by an human figure but there were calumniators in his time as\ well as as there are now he was charged with atheism for mixing truth with\ lies and having no more regard for either than to treat them alike yet if we\ look nearer into this matter we shall be convinced that the learned painter\ was not in the least tinctured with atheism did it not happen in heathenisn\ agypt was not pharaoh\'92 daughter present did she believe the truth which was\ only manifested to israel certainly she did not since therefore the fact lay in\ an heathenisn country and was done in the presence of but two hebrezo women the others being ethnicks this great artist has not trespassed either against the\ christian faith or against the art.\ and although at the first view well-grounded objection may be that with\ things which relate to religion no false gods or deities worshipped by the hea-\ thens ought to be mixed and that it is sufficient for painter to represent river\ in its natural course and not in an human forin yet the objection is easily an-\ swered for scripture reprefents the waters and the noise of rivers under an\ human form as in psalm xeviii where it is faid that they clapped their hands\ and were joyful moreover the agyptians never worshipped the rivers but the\ crocodiles living in them and isis under the shape of cow as ovid and other\ writers testisy.\ since then scripture makes use of allegorical speeches painter may also ex-\ hibit his subject under symbolical and perceptible likenesses in order to be the\ more intelligible to the spectator without fear that his work will mislead faithful\ christians or strengthen heathenisn superstition for painter who has no other\ language to express himself by but figures ought to make use of them if he\ would be understood.\ rubens who of all the painters handled those symbolical figures in the most\ agreeable and learned manner as we may particularly observe in the cardinal\ infant\'92 entry into anizverp and in the paintings of the luxemburgh gallery is\ taxed by some with mixing in those compofitions truth with fictions but\ how easily is this judgment to be refuted by shewing the use that judicious artist\ made thereof for fiction is here not at all mingled with truth but only tends\ to make truth clear to sight and apprehension and thus more plainly to express\ it by the fictitious characters and emblems.\ pray observe in his birth of the french king lewis xiii how that ex-\ cellent artist has exhibited castor with an artful sway on distant clouds sitting\ on his winged horse and opposite to him apollo who in his radiant chariot is\ driving upwards in order to shew that this prince was happily born in the\ morning hereby it is evident that this ingenious master had no thoughts of\ representing deitics as deities but only to denote by castor as accounted an\ happy constellation the king\'92 fortunate birth and by apollo the time of the\ day which was in the morning appearing by his chariot\'92 mounting up from\ the horizon.\ but further to clear my thoughts touching the representation of god the\ father shall before end this chapter subjoin the following observation.\ the prophet ezekiel in his first chapter mentions that he saw the almighty\ from the appearance of his loins even upwards and from the appearance of his\ loins even downwards as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness\ round about wherefore by this and other instances of scripture we suppose that this sacred figure ought never to be represented without glittering or glory\ from head to foot even in such manner that bigger or less according to the\ place occafion and decorum and spreading around gradually thinner and fainter like clear and transparent vapour it at last insensibly unites with the by-works and disappears.\ now to reduce this to painting we ought first to design the figure of the\ almighty whether sitting or standing in heaven or on carth in the most per-\ fect form and countenance yet much bigger than any heavenly or earthly\ creature this you must colour with single tint or ground little darker\ than the glorv and afterwards heighten with light then with large brush soften\ the figure so that neither its out-line nor any edginess or sharpness of the parts\ of the face hands or feet which ought to be touched very gentle and faint be perceived just as if it were viewed through silk gause steamed glafs or\ thin mist in short like things seen in camera obscura observing that the\ figure do not receive any light either from on high or from afide or from be-\ hind but in front only and about the most relievede parts although the whole\ piece\ piece have another light it must moreover have no other shades than in the\ deepest cavities and those very faint.\ we have before cursorily shewed why we represeat the almighty as vene-\ rable old man and shall now further insist on the point though without re-\ ference to all the paffages in scripture which might serve our purpose in daniel chap vii it is written the hair of his head was like pure wool and his gar-\ ment white as snow the reason whereof says gregorius nazianzenus is to shew\ thereby as by an infallible token his clean and undefiled being wherefore\ the wise euscherus is also of opinion that for the same reason the choir and\ multitude of angels are represented in white others compare it to the human\ shapc and would thercby allude to infinite duration since nothing is so eternal\ as the godhead which remark here because some scrupulous persons are of\ opinion that we ought not to represent god the father in such shape actorned\ with white garments and grey hair.\ and on this account all nations have by an universal consent thought proper to perform divine service in white garments and ornaments the white has also\ been at all times appropriated to the holy service wherefore the poet persius says he is worshipped in white.\ but what is persius\'92 saying to us since the raiment of jesus christ when he\ manifested his glory to his disciples appeared as white as snow cicero lib says the white looks best in all stuffs but especially in the woven ones in order to exhibit what is holy and godly.\ it is therefore necessary to represent the almighty in white garment how-\ ever it is not improper to make it look more natural that you keep it little\ yellowisn as lighted by sun or like the glory which surrounds the figure.\ but in all this painter must be very discreet and not abuse the licence al-\ lowed him by scripture and the consent of the fathers or by his art pervert\ the sacred truths or slight them.\ chap xiii of the glories proper to angels and heathenish\ deities.\ vaving shewed in what manner and on what terms according to my\ ljudgment to represent the almighty let us now inquire how the angels in their power ought to be exhibited.\ gregorius nazianzenus says that the true property of the angels when they ap-\ pear in bodily shape is to have bright glory and glittering garments we\ sind the angels thus described in mait xxviii in mark xvi- in acts many other places of scripture.\ this glittering light of the angels ought therefore by all means to be observed\ in most of their appearances as for instance in those to abraham and in the de-\ livering\ livering lot out of sodom where they smote the lustful people with blindnefs for it is ceitain they had something more than human since abraham salutes them\ as lords it is not likely that this honour proceeded from their costly dress jewels and other precious things about them but from some heavenly or uncom-\ mon addition.\ further proof of this glory of the angels is the sore pressing of the sodomites\ upon lot and their not coveting either him or his daughters or any other strangers\ probably living among them but only these two young men to be brought out in\ order to know them and perhaps because of their more than human form and\ charming brightnefs if now this glory had shone too strong they would have\'ac\ perceived some deity and forbore their wickedness for it can not be imagined that any man should daringly and knowingly strive against the almighty.\ but before we proceed further imust here deliver my opinion touching the per-\ son of jesus christ which is that in his humanity and before his resurrection he\ ought to be represented without the least shining or glory since he was made\ in the likeness of men and would be like his bretfiren in all things except sin as scripture testifies but after his resurrection he should be shewn with glory\ as we read he appeared to his disciples on mount tabor and in other places as\ having then put off his humanity in its principal purpose now to proceed.\ we have further instances of the appearance of angels as in those who came\ to manoah gideon and tobit and him who smote the people of jerusalem for da-\ vid\'92 sin of the first scripture exprefsly says that he foretelling ma-\ noah the birth of samson ascended in the flame of the altar possibly in an aug-\ mentation of glory uniting with the slame of the offering by which doubling\ brightnefs the parents of samson were strengthened in their faith and hope of the\ birth to come.\ if this glory now be painted too strong and like lightning it blinds our mor-\ tal eves and thus the patriarch abraham could have viewed it no more than the\ prophet and leader of lsfrael moses when god appeared to him and passed before\ the blind heathens had glimmerings of this truth for when semele presump-\ tuously defired that jupiter might once embrace her in the same majesty as he\ did juno in heaven and insisted on it notwithstanding his dissuasion to the con-\ trary she was on the requeft granted intirely consumed by the attending glory\ of the god insomuch that with difficulty he saved the child he had by her-\ whence it is plain that the glory even in exhibiting the heathenisn deities ought to be observed since in their appearance to men either by night or day to bless or punisn them they retained tneir full force glory and majesty and\ this being weighed they must also be represented glittering beautiful in aspect\ and shape and in raiment of an elegant colour as much as possible and the\ nature and use of the picture will permit as we haye before hinted in the hand-\ ling of colours in cieling pieces.\ but when the deities appear among men as men then they ought to be like\ them and not eafily distinguishable otherwise than by their mein as for in-\ stance in the story of jupiter with calisto apollo with dophne jupiter with lycaon mercury\ mercury with argus and the like in such cases and that they might the better\ play their parts they transformed themselves intirely into men and were perfectly\ like them laying aside all god-like glory and shape as if according to the opi\'ac\ nion of the heathens they meant that there can be no union of the divine with\ human nature.\ as to the motions of the heathenisn deities many represent them appearing in\ active postures as walking running and other motions but it is as contrary\ to my own opinion as that of the great bishop of hippo heliodorus this learned\ man and great searcher into heathenisn antiquities will not allow them to go or\ walk when seen in their majesty but only to wave or seem in some measure\ to walk yet gliding like fhip moved gently along by the wind without per-\ ceptible motion they ought always to be set out with thin clouds of which\ such as are nearest them receive greater and stronger light.\ chap xiv of the representations of angels and heathenisb\ genii.\ yhe almighty in the beginning created an infinite number of angels or\ heavenly spirits who in scripture are distinguished by names as seraphins cherubins thrones powers arch-angels angels .\ the first as being nearest to the glory of the almighty are always represented\ young and harmless and with six wings according to lsaiah ch vi.\ the second are exhibited only for the sake of motion and to denote the\ efficacy of eternal happiness which their undefiled purity and childish form give\ to understand.\ the third who continually attend god\'92 justice as dionysius arcopagita st.\ paul\'92 disciple writes are somewhat older and more full-grown and of an\ agreeable sway and motion causing by their appearances no fear or fright but\ joy and gladness in people\'92 minds.\ the fourth are appointed to execute divine vengeance in the punishment of\ fins and wickedness of these one was so strong that with the almighty\'92 per-\ mission he smote in the camp of the assyrians men kings xix cron.\ xxxii isaiah xxxvii these are represented bigger than the former having stern\ countenances and violent motions are seldom or ever naked but in coats of\ armour and with flaming sword or thunder in their hands or else shield on\ theiz arms with the name of god glittering thereon by their unexpected ap-\ pearance they cause not only fear and fright in the wicked but continual re-\ morse without repentance.\ the fifth manage great and courtly affairs as- guardians leading men to the\ knowledge of god they are of perfect form and modest countenance.\ the\ the last protect us from all hurt and are particularly ordained to excite us\ to virtue and dissuade us from evil acts xii these according to dionysius as being the eldest in the lowest choir or hierarchy are represented of large size majestic and quick in motion.\ there is still another kind called evil spirits or damones or devils plato\ calls them cacod\'e6mones or knowing and crafty these afflict the wicked and\ induce them to all manner of sin as blasphemy unchasteness gluttony drun-\ kenness lying defrauding murder their shapes are various even as.\ many as there are sins and although they endeavour sometimes to mislead men\ under beautiful appearances yet they are always represented by some token\ whereby to know them either on their heads backs hands or feet such as fins bats wings vultures or eagles claws bears paws dragons tails also hold-\ ing lighted torches pitchforks purses murdering weapons crowns fetters yokes serpents and adders and with flames issuing out of their mouths in word any thing that betokens evil.\ as to the angels before-mentioned who in all ages have been represented\ with wings scripture allows us the liberty so to exhibit them for the al-\ mighty himself shewed moses the pattern of the ark of the covenant and the\ cherubins in this manner upon it can any example be more perfect than his more instances in scripture may be found in the prophecies of daniel ch ix vi rev iv ezekiel .\ having thus far treated of the representation of angels we shall now shew the\ opinion of the heathens not ill agreeing with the same meaning.\ plutarch tells us that the ancient romans had also their tutelar guardians by\ them stiled genii or birth-gods but they were not represented as angels or sit-\ ting upon clouds or with wings or glories but as well-shaped young men be-\ tween sixteen and twenty years of age and without beards having long light\ hair composed countenances and easy motions and dog\'92 skin over their up-\ per parts.\ the reason of this cloathing was as chrysippus says that they as good spirits attend us from our nativities being guardians of our actions in reproving vice\ and revenging transgrefsions as often as we prefer brutality before humanity which the genii abhorred pursuing and barking at us in order to awake the\ conscience of which opinion is censorinus and several others whom he quotes adding that these spirits watch so narrowly that they never leave us inciting\ us to virtue in proportion as we forsake vice and covet felicity but why need\ we these examples our saviour affirms that the angels have charge over us to conduct and preserve us as we have before said wherefore the heathens by\ this emblem have also rightly stiled their genii guardians.\ censorinus likewise testifies that the ancients considered their genii as gods of\ procreation either that as we have said they took care of us or were born\ with us for which reason they believed there were as many genii as men and\ that each had his own or else that there were twice as many and that each man\ had good one and an evil one the former persuading to virtue and the latter\ to vice agreeable to what christians say of their guardian angels and the devil this last not failing to afflict mankind though not born with us as the heathens\ believed of their genii hence it is that some represent the genii in the shape\ of serpent others as children or young men or else as grey-headed old men conformable to the philosopher cebes in his hieroglyphical table.\ zoroaster and the ancient philosophers have made distinction between the ani-\ mals consecrated to the good and evil genii according to them dogs fowls and the tortoise are proper to the good and water animals peculiar to the evil.\ the ancients often exhibited the genii crowned with garlands of horehound the leaves whereof much resemble those of the vine or else with chaplets of di-\ vers forts of flowers as tibullus in certain place says ee the genius is adorned\ with beautiful chaplet of flowers when his name and festival are celebrated to\ his honour each person worshipped his genius without knowing it in celebrating his\ birth-day and those of princes were especially kept by every body with great\ splendor wherefore he who falsly swore by the genius of his prince which was\ accounted very great oath was an immediate delinquent.\ since as is said the ancients had two kinds of genii good one and an\ evil one according to the socratic euclid as censorinus relates we shall now con-\ sider how the evil were represented.\ do not find the ancients had any statues or resemblances of them but we\ read as writers testify that they appeared to many.\ plutarch appianus florus and others report that as bruius one night accord-\ ing to his custom had betaken himself with light to his apartment for medita-\ tion he saw before him the likeness of man but very frightful black and cloathed\ in wolf\'92 skin who being afked who he was answered am thy evil ge-\ nius brutus valerius maximus also writes that the evil genius appeared to cassius of the cursed tribe of marcus antonius little besore caesar caused him to be be-\ headed this genius appeared as large black man about fifty or sixty years\ of age having long hair and dirty matted beard and was covered with wolf\'92\ skin down half way the thighs.\ the temesians formerly inhabitants of abruzzo country in iraly had also very evil genius of black colour and frighful look and cloathed in wolf\'92\ skin doing that people much damage as paufanias and suidas testify.\ chap xv of sacred emblems.\ the defign of well-composed sacred emblem is principally to edify and\ to incite to virtue representing it to us as looking glass not so much\ for the regulation of our bodies as our souls and by such means to bring us to\ happiness.\ these emblems are either general or particular general when they suit any\ person whatsoever and particular when they relate te one only when their\ subject\ subject is piety or virtue learning liberty peace of mind and such like they-\ are general and applicable to every person who possesses or endeavours to pol-\ sefs those qualities but when particular person is their subject as the vir-\ gin mary an apostle or other virtuous man who excelled in some particular\ gift in such case they are particular or singular we ought therefore in the\ former fort to observe that the main matter is spiritual and in the latter cor-\ poral the one exhibits learning itself and the other learned man or philoso-\ pher one shews peace and the other peaceable man one represents piety and the other pious man the one is the matter itself and the other he\ who possesses it however judicious master will make distinction be-\ tween spiritual and corporal virtues between natural inclinations and heavenly\ gifts the corporal as strength prudence equity and the like proceed\ from us or in better terms are peculiar to us walk stand and act with us and the spiritual and heavenly and which consequently have no relation with\ the body are as without us wherefore they must be represented either sitting\ or lying on clouds and the nearer they approach beatitude the more glitter-\ ing nimble faint and waving they are to be exhibited.\ am of opinion that we ought to adapt particular sorts of stuffs to the afore-\ virtues and qualities according to their ranks and dignities as to cloath\ the earthly in stuffs and cloth and in thick silk and those still higher in\ gause scarfs or else to let them remain naked.\ we must further remark on the last of these that the characters called the\ qualities of god imean figural characters such as the eye implying dominion the circled serpent eternity the sun glory and such like ought always to\ appear in the uppermost glory as pertaining to the deity and are represented\ by lovely waving children yet let it be observed that those things only re-\ spect the blessings of heaven for when the almighty is provoked and is to\ inflict punishiments we must introduce other qualities such as his wrath justice also represented by angels with thunder siery swords scales but these\ ought to be stronger and like young men as we find it in scripture in the\ story of lot where they struck the sodomites with blindness and in that of sen-\ zacherib where an angel of the lord in one night smote so many thousands and\ more such cases.\ shall illustrate what have before said by further examples in such manner\ as apprehend the point and for that purpose have chosen an uncommon sub-\ ject to serve for particular\ emblem and stately monument of her majesty mary stuart late queen of great bri-\ tain france and ireland princess of orange.\ here tomb is standing on the left side of the piece on basement whereon\ is carved the river-god of the thames in the middle of the piece on the se-\ cond ground princess is sitting in grandeur on throne representing englans\ with its proper badges she leans her head on her left hand and with het\ right opens the royal robe of the deceased which is lined with ermin and witl-\ the sceptre and crown lies in her lap whereon she casts forrowful look she is\ covered with black gause weed which darkens the glitter of the seat and coat\ of arms policy on her left side quite dejected is beholding the tomb ac-\ companied by sorrow on the other side appears the protestant church lan-\ guishing supported by hope who points at the tomb whereon stands large\ beautiful antique vase out of which is growing rose-twig having but one bud whereon providence sitting on clouds dispenses some moisture out of small\ crystal phial and with her sceptre points upwards at the celestial light to\ which wisdom piety and stedfastnefs are seen flying supporting or rather\ carrying beautiful young virgin along with them this virgin is drest in\ white and crowned with roses having bright star over her head her hands\ are crofs her breast and she is looking upwards with joyful countenance.\ on high appears god\'92 love or tendernefs waiting for her with open arms having in its lap pelican feeding its young with its own blood the other\ characters of divine happinefs before-mentioned are also seen and especially\ heavenly or perfect joy or harmony represented by spirits singing and playing\ on instruments on the vase is medal wherein is carved phoenix arising out\ of its afhies under it on black table is written in gold letters either in\ latin or englissi tdie in orderto live the tomb is hung with fes-\ toons of cypress intermixed with roses on the right side of the tomb stands\ fate having in the left hand rose close to the vase and in the right pair of\ scissors as if she had cut off the rose with them on the left side of the tomb\ stands nature dejectedly holding handkerchief before her eyes and with the\ left hand at her breast envy to the right forwards is taking to flight biting\ an heart and looking either at providence or at the beatified soul ascending.\ about the throne stand scotland france and lreland in mourning.\ second example-\ here we may represent majesty on raised throne sitting in full splendor clemency and authority standing behind her and holding over her head crown\ topped with glittering star on her side may sit religion and on step be-\ low policy taking shelter under her garment quiet plenty and success by\ land and sea may be placed as coming in and on the other side peace ac-\ companied by art and science above in an open heaven fits providence\ pouring down divine blessing over the throne on cloud should be wisdom religiousness and stedfastnets.\ this majesty may be here the subject of this emblem and if it have no par-\ ticular characters suit any kingdom power or commonwealth in oristendom but if it have any arms device or motto as sufficit unus or flower-\ de-luce for france plus ultra for spain honi soit qui maly\ pense for england then this majesty ought to be like that which it is to re-\ present.\ it would not be improper to see the glory filled with divine love or kind-\ nefs as before-mentioned and prosperity flowing from it fright and fear tak-\ ing to flight and envy fraud and heresy under majesty\'92 feet.\ the active virtues represent by figures which hold the crown over ma-\ jesty\'92 head and those sitting on clouds .\ third example.\ the subject of this shall be innocence murdered.\ here innocence is prostrate murdered by raging impiety she lies near an\ extinguished altar stretched out on the ground cloathed in clean white gar-\ ment betokening an upright undefiled heart the cruel executioner forcibly\ tears her innocent child from her breast and at the same time the brutish mur-\ derer is stepping from the eminence whereon he sat in order to go off he is\ stained with innocent blood and sheathing his bloody sword tramples under\ foot pelican with its young rage attending him and firing them with her\ torch is looking back in great consternation at heaven which darts many\ thunders at her there divine justice is descending with scales in one hand\ and thunders in the other piety bowing before her at the altar is praying.\ and shewing her the innocent corpse whereupon she doubles her speed to exe-\ cute revenge now see the wrath of god expressed not with bright sun-beams.\ from on high but with fiery and bloody ones.\ here justice or divine wrath has flaming red garment or veil impiety\ is cloathed in rusty copper-coloured drapery the executioner who misuses.\ the child has cruel aspect and is reddish over innocence little angel is.\ ascending to heaven with bright star to which long ray seems to proceed\ out of her mouth he has palm-branch in his hand to fignify her happiness.\ the following is fhort sketch of the actions.\ the head of the corpse lies on the middle of the piece on the fore-ground little up as if there were still some life left behind the altar piety kneels\ the second ground is with her upper parts directly over the point of sight and\ her feet somewhat fore-shortened towards the right side from whence sne is-\ coming on the left side on the same ground little more forward impiety\ and rage take to flight rage is half-shaded by dark clouds over which hea-\ ven opens the fore-ground has right light but justice receives-her light\ from behind on the left side of the piece is dark off-scape.\ now as the former emblem represented the reward of virtue so this repre-\ sents the punishment of evil in that appeared the love of god in this his\ wrath.\ thus are my thoughts an these subjects not presuming to have handled them.\ with the utmost accuracy am far from giving them out as perfect emblems since that is the work of great judgment vast knowledge and mature consi-\ deration nevertheless rough as the plan is it is sufficient for explaining my\ sentiments.\ sentiments and as we always stick either more or less to art and hardly keep\ so much within the-bounds of curiosity as not to take some liberties in the dis-\ position of things so have represented him who is taking away the child as an\ cxccutioner naked his hair tied with cloth and with dagger lying by him and impiousitess as prince with bloody diadem about his head and staff in his\ hand though these figures ought rather to be women moreover the execur\ tioner might have been left out.\ chap xvi of the penates lares and cupids.\ ncient historics relate that most nations which lived under laws and\ policy especially the hebrews greeks and romans -but mostly these last\ fad certain figures of gold silver copper or wood which they stiled dii pe-\ nates in engiisa houshold-gods these they kept as holy and took such par-\ ticulat care of that in case they happened to be lost either through carlessness violence or other accidents they thought it foreboded some imminent disaster\ or bad luck to befall them and accordingly believed when any such were at\ hand that those gods were either removing or vanished.\ the historian tim\'e6us writes that they were represented like two beautiful young\ men in warlike dress each with javelin in his hand and by or near them an\ earth\'e9n fire-pan over which lay two long iron bars crofs-ways turned at the ends\ like the hazel wands which augures held in their hands at the time of\ officiating.\ cicero treating of the penates says they were certain gods brought forth in\ the houses of particular men and worshipped in the most concealed and private\ places of them and in this sense demophoon and terence spake when they said they would go home and hide their household gods before they betook to their\ business and callings.\ in scripture also we have the teraphims or household gods which rachel stole\ from her father laban when he went to sheer his sheep as the rabbi eliezer in\ the chapter of his discourses largely treats speaking of laban and the\ preparing of the teraphims.\ we have before said that the penates were in great esteem among the romans which dionysius halicarnassus affirins saying they were worshipped at rome un-\ der the shape of two sitting young men in very ancient and warlike dresses and\ having javelins in their hands with this subscription dii penates as we find it\ still in ancient medals nigidius was of opinion that they were apollo and neptune and the rather as by apollo is meant heat and drought and by neptune cold and\ moistness judging the worship to owe its origin to these cffects wherefore virgil\ in the eighth book of his aneids stiles them the great gods meaning the pe-\ nates others think that jupiter and juno are signisied by them because their\ chief\ chief businefs was to give men help and asfistance and therefore they both derive\ from the latin word juvare signifying to help or assist others again imagine\ them to be castor and pollux because they with the penates or household gods were also according to the ancient poets and historians in very great esteem and\ the raman worshiyy asfigned them the first places in their temples.\ it will here be proper to deduce something touching these gods from antiquity the better to illustrate the point.\ we read that when the daughter of pallantes was married to dardanus she\ brought in dower the gifts which pallas had made her present of being an ob-\ long shield dropt from heaven which she stiled palladium and the figures of the\ penates or great gods afterwards on rebellion breaking out in peloponnesus where dardanus and his wife lived he with many of the arcadians fled from thence taking shipping for samothracia where in consideration of those gifts brought as\ portion he built temple instituting private solemnities for their religious\ worship keeping them srom the common people in vault under the ground .\ and soon after on his departure for asia took them with him and placed them in\ dardania so called from his name his son llus being employed in building\ llium or troy transplanted those gods thither aeneas afterwards having saved\ them out of the slames of that city carried them to italy placing them in the city\ of lavinium ascaniushis son removed them to the city of alba where he dedi-\ cated large and magnificent temple to their honour but they say the gods of\ themselves without human assistance returned the next night to taviniam though\ the gates were fast and the town-wall and roof of the temple found intire and\ without any breaches which miracle very much surprising ascanius he sent to\ livinium six hundred men called curatores of whom egestus was chief to guard\ the gods at last being carried to rome they remained without any alteration and the roman people committing to them the care and protection of their city and growing empire placed them in imitation of cardanus that they might not\ be stolen either by fraud or violence in vault or temple under ground wherein after consecration they offered sacrifices to them not allowing any person to spit\ in this temple because the gods like vesta were worshipped with fire.\ they were represented as young men and sitting with javelins in their hands to signify their being adored as maintainers and protectors for the sitting hiero-\ glyphically expresses stedfastness in what we design to do the javelins imply that\ they preserve from harm and disaster and the youthfulness denotes the increase of\ the lares were much like the penates at least in the guard and care of cities.\ they also are said to have hid or kept themselves secret in the houses as well as\ the penates which tibullus affirms saying that they have not only the care of\ particular houses but also of the whole town.\ the ancients used to place dogs to watch their idols called lares as being .\ creature kind and fawning on the family and fierce and frightf ul to stranger.\ they had the same opinion- of their lares or houshold gods committing to\ them the intire care and safeguard of their families for this reason says plutarch the romans represented them as brisk young men dressed in dog-skins ovid\ affirms affrins they were sonietimes exhibited in short garments gathered up on the left\ shoulder and coming down under the right in order to be more sree and loose in\ their motion because says he their business was like that of the genii men-\ tioned before to inquire narrowly into mens actions for the punishment of the\ wicked the philosopher jamblichus relates that they were often worshipped on\ the roads and had froin time to timne offerings of wine and frankincense.\ we shall now treat of the shape of children distinguishing them into heavenly\ and earthly.\ poussin exhibited them too squab and full for flying and those of raphael are\ gencrally chiesly in the borders of the histories of psyche too hard and masculous wherefore to find good form we must keep medium between both but\ cupids ought not to be represented so heavy as earthly children yet as young as\ you please the earthly contrarily must have understanding in order to handle\ something and their bodies to be enlarged according to what they are to do or\ carry but in representing cupid who is to deliver message think it is\ proper to give him age and bulk enough to do the business punctually and the\ better to express truth and nature as to their wings they must not be made in\ proportion to the weight of their bodies like birds for their bodies wave of them-\ selves and the bigness of the wings often creates deformity unless they are to re-\ present fame when they ought to be larger.\ as to the loves or cupids themselves they according to my apprehension differ as much in size as action the one is by the poets called capid and the\ other anteros the former creates love and desire for voluptiousness and the\ latter leads to virtues arts and sciences they have both like beautiful and\ agreeable aspect according to their ages cupid is represented about six or eight\ years old and quite naked armed with bow and arrows and sometimes holding\ burning torch anteros contrarily has purple garment with bare arms\ and legs only crown of laurel about his head burning torch in his hand sandals on his feet and he is about twelve or fourteen years of age cupid is wild\ and frolicksome anteros sedate and contemplative.\ there is another less kind of cupids somewhat younger and more simple than\ the former.\ these increase love incite the pleasures of voluptuousness or\ more stronger delude the senses to them in order to shew their simplicity are\ ascribed childish and idle actions such as dancing skipping about running rolling flying slinging apples at each other they must not have quivers bows arrows or torches but baskets of fruit and flowers or chaplets look-\ ing glass or any thing tending to the pleafures of venus.\ alexander propertius philoftratus claudianus silius stalicus apulcius and others\ relate that the different loves and cupids do not only respect the charms and\ service of venus but also imply the desires and tendencies of the heart since\ all men do not affect the same object but each chuses for himself.\ we represent cupid or love in the form of little child because it is sot-\ tisn to betake to venerv for the actions and speeches of those in love are as\ imperfect as those of little children as virgil shews in dido -she begins to\ speak and stops in the middle of her talk he is exhibited with wings to\ signify\ fignify the inconstancy of lovers who change with every wind as we see in\ dido who was to put to death the person whom fhe before so dearly loved.\ he\ has arrows in his hand because they are also very light and do not always hit\ the mark as we have said of lovers who are whimsical and fickle when they\ can not gratify their wishies and as the arrows are sharp and piercing so the sins\ of concupiscence no less wound the conscience the arrows are likewise an\ emblem of love which like thunder seizes the heart for many have experi-\ mented the sorrowful isfue of being captivated by the amorous glances of beau-\ tiful woman and through their fiery paffions been led into great troubles for\ which reason cupid is sometimes represented with thunder in his hand.\ chap xvii devotional actions of nations.\ of all the perfections of human nature religion is the most excellent and\ most universal wherefore all nations partake of it in their manner of liv\'ac\ ing and service and as reason principally distinguishes man from beasts so we\ any where see that the use of it binds men to some religious duties as attend-\ ing human understanding and according to jamblichus platonic sectary ex-\ citing it by natural desire and-propensity to do good and shun evil to which\ some allude by the celestial fire in the fable of prometheus with which he ani-\ mated the first man thereby signifying that as the soul is governed by religion so our actions must chiefly tend to implore blessing on them and our eyes and\ hands be lifted up to heaven knowing that all good proceeds from the invisible\ giver of all things and we ought thankfully to receive it to his honour and\ glory we shall therefore in order to be both delightful and useful shew from\ antiquity how and in what manner divers nations not enlightened by the gos-\ pel have dedicated their worship under fictions and fables to the invisible being and begin with the egyptians.\ the custom of these people was when any person prayed to the gods that\ he must as the most decent action do it standing and with lifted up hands which posture was also strictly observed by the romans in their religious worship as martial and horace testify virgil likewise shewe that standing with hands\ lifted up signifies worship when he introduces anchises at the miraculous sight\ of julus\'92 head encompassed with shining light and yet his hair unhurt by the\ flame joyfully turning his eyes to heaven and lifting his hands in prayer to\ jupiter and in confirmation of the acceptablenefs thereof loud thunder was\ soon after heard and star appeared in the heavens when dark which like torch with long clear tail descending towards the house glid along and at last\ hid in the wood of mount lda leaving behind long stripe which emitted sul-\ gods\ phurous vapour and smoke whereupon anchise standing up invokes the\ and\ and sacred stars philo says that the erect standing posture denotes an humble\ heart wholly devoting itself to heaven authors unanimoussy agree that the\ ancients offered their sacrifices vows and prayers to jupiter in standing posture but to the goddess ops in sitting one signifying thereby that she was the mo-\ ther of the earth eythagoras enjoins those who pray to do it sitting yet plu-\ tarch says that numa pompilius was the author of that custom thereby teaching that vows and prayers ought to be certain and constant.\ as tothe posture of praying standing st. paul seems to exhort thereto in his\ epistles we find likewise in the old testament that the priests did in their\ prayers stretch out their hands to heaven in the book of judges chap vii.\ we read that in gideon\'92 army the men who bowed down on their knees to drink were by god\'92 command sent away but those who drank standing putting\ their hands to their mouths were chosen and defeated the midianites in exod.\ chap xvii it is written that as long as moses held up his hands amalek was dis-\ comfitted which as adamantius says signifies that he offered up to god his\ actions and enterprizes not like creeping animals who cleave to the earth but\ as directing his heart and thoughts to heaven on which grounds and examples\ the council of nice ordained prayer to be made standing.\ adoration says pliny not only consists in lifting up the hands to heaven but\ also in their being open inside upwards as if we gave them to kifs they who\ adore and supplicate says hieronymus are used to kiss the hands wherefore the\ hebrezes judged this manner of kissing to be very reverential and strictly observed\ it cicero and catullus also confirm the signification of lifting up or stretching out\ both the hands to heaven tertullian speaking of praying for the preservation\ and prosperity of the emperor says thus the christians bareheaded lift up\ their hands with their eyes to heaven in token of innocence signifying thereby\ that they had no occasion to be afhamed but heartily prayed for their emperor.\ the tuscans likewise in their prayers used such posture or stretching out the\ hands and in adoring their gods especially jupiter lifted up their hands to\ heaven of which virgil also makes mention in his fourth aneid where he de-\ scribes jarbas among the statues and altars of the gods lifting up his hands to\ heaven humbly and earnestly imploring jupiter we read further that in the\ olympic games anciently celebrated at smyrna ridiculous and ignorant actor was\ reproved by the sophist polemon for his awkward motions with hands reversed because when he was to say oh jupiter/ he turned his hands downwards and in\ saying oh earth he looked up to heaven but these perverse gestures pro-\ ceeding from ancient customs are still seen among the romishi clergy who as often\ as they pronounce the word god or lord give the blessing to the congregation and in praying for the prosperity of the people stretch out their hands on high.\ in the medal of gordiauus pius we see small figure with the arms thus extended\ and the hands open with motto alluding to the matter pietas august but to\ return to the ancient agyplians they used to represent the deity in an hieroglyphic manner by circle and\ agrecable thereto the philosopher pythagoras enjoined turning round in the ado-\ ration of the gods alcinous says also that he gathered from the greek writings that\ that they had an ancient custom of running round the altars when they offered sa-\ crifice beginning from the left to the right side according to the zodiac and\ then running from right to left plutarch thinks this was done in imitation of the\ heavenly motions in their continual rotation which mortals ought to follow though others pretend that thereby was meant the continual changes and insta-\ bility of human actions as for the continual motion and turning of the body in\ prayer we find it to have been the custom of divers nations and in this sense\ the poet propertius in his first book accosts his mistress \'97ecl have often turned\ round before your door aud offered up to you my soul and my prayers there is passage in suetonius when he speaks of the ancestors of vitellius ce he had says he particular address for flattery and was the first who com-\ manded divine worfhip to be paid to caius casar and no person durst after his\ return from syria appear in his presence without being covered and turning se-\ should turn several times round in prayer to heaven and afterwards sit down thereby intimating that in worldly affairs mertals must expect nothing but ine\ constancy and continual change which they ought to bear with patience and re-\ solution add to this what pliny says that the manner of turning round in\ prayer was from the left to the right hand in imitation of the earth which ac-\ us that as camillus in prayer turned round according to the roman custom he\ suddenly fell by which accident the people much addicted to superstition marcellus being at war with the transalpine gauls and come to town called capide\ in order to charge them his horse affrighted by the shouts of the enemy went\ backwards wherefore to encourage his men he turned him round as if he were\ adoring the sun according to the roman custom before battle and thus covered\ the accident without the peoples perceiving it.\ we shall now for the reader\'92 greater satisfaction treat of piety and what re-\ lates to it.\ the ancients chiefly esteemed the altar as an hieroglyphic of piety offering being supposed medium between heavenly and human things they pretended\ c\'e9\ it to be mediator or messenget accordingly virgil in his aneid they\ touch the altar and call the fire upon it and the gods to witnefs urge further that fire unites with material parts and always rises upwards from\ below as knowing all our earthly actions and imparting them to the heavenly\ spirits hence we see that the manners of offering sacrifices are not without\ some foundation in reason because the laws of nature are always purely observed.\ and since the world has been enlightened with the truth fire is customarily\ used in divine service and no facrifice was thought acceptable without it in-\ deed if earthly creatures can any way reconcile us to heaven nothing has greater\ affinity with the fire as it lights and clears every thing wherefore they think\ that they may represent the genii and angels even the dity itself by it.\ as\ as to the altars and piety we see in the medal of the emperor alius with open hands which as before observed signifies worship and by it\ an altar with these letters pietas in one of hadrianus augustus is the same\ figure between stork and an altar adorned with ground-ivy with this inscrip-\ tion pietas aug in one of diva augusta faustina appears woman lift-\ ing up her garment with the left hand and laying the offering on the burning\ altar with the other having the word pietas in the medal of lucilla we see\ figure standing behind the altar with cup in its hand as ready to offer with\ the word pietas in that of antoninus is the figure of piety opening the\ right hand as token of adoration and with-the left ready to put the sacrifice\ on the altar with the same inscription in the gold medal of alius caesar the right hand of the figure is in the same action and the left holds gift alsp\ inscribed pietas.\ we offer prayers and supplications either in making vows or receiving fa-\ vours in consequence of them hence proceed the various inscriptions on me-\ dals which neverthelefs do all allude to piety whether in praying for help or\ returning thanks accordingly we find in the medal of jalia pia aug. wo-\ man tucking up her garment on the left-side and offering with the right with\ this inscription vota publica but in one of hadrianus are two figures one like the emperor and the other holds in the left hand palm-sprig and\ with the right offers him cup having this motto adventuti augusti.\ in one of domitian is burning altar inscribed princeps juventutis.\ the altars were anciently as they are now -- days places of safety and pro-\ tection wherefore priamus in virgil having lost all hope of preservation took sanctuary at the altar of which his wife had said this altar shall protect\ us all cicero speaking of the actor roscius says we run into his house as to\ an altar and ovid in his triftib says the altar only is left me in my mis-\ fortune.\ the athenians had particular altar dedicated to mercy and compafsion as\ we gather from the poet papinius and lactantius grammaticus and from apfinis in\ his rhetoric plutarch treating of superstition calls the altar abominable xe\'ac\ zophon in his second book of the state of greece takes vesta for an emblem of\ refuge to the altar when theramenes says he had heard the things he took.\ to vesta for refuge pollux calls vesta the altar of offering especially that at the\ prytaneum where the everlasting fire was kept dionysius harlicarnassus says .\ that romulus built temple in honour of vesta and as memorial of his hav\'ac\ ing divided the roman people into thirty wards suetonius writes almost the same\ in the life of tiberius.\ in fine the altars were set up for facrifices and prayer to obtain divine favour\ and blessing though few have determined which of the various sacrifices was\ best and most approved by the ancients who offered to the almighty only in\ spirit\ *the place in athens where the judges and magistrates sat and where those who had done\ any confiderable service to the common-wealth were maintained at the public charge.\ spirit and understanding without uttering word wherefore the megyptians ho-\ noured the crocodile as having no tongue applying it to the divine silence-\ they praised the spirits and souls of the ever-blessed and offered to heavenly\ things material ones such-as had some affinity with them viz fire to the sun but to the evil spirits or devils they brought offerings that they might not\ hurt or obstruct them or that their uncleanness might not pollute the sacrifice\ or the savour of the meat the agyptiansf always thought it abominable to\ expiate with the blood of animals and therefore offered only prayers and frank-\ incense the kings of the ptolemaic line enjoined them sacrifices to serapis and\ saturn to whom they built temples without their towns wherein to offer beasts\ as usual though in after-times according to the inhuman custom of busiris on\ his usurping the countries and places bordering on the nile they offered men.\ but of offerings we shall treat further in the following chapter.\ chap xviii of the different offerings of nations and their\ rites.\ as from highest antiquity down to these times different regards have been\ had for many persons and places and the knowledge thereof much con-\ oerns an artist so he ought diligently to inquire into the ancient manners and\ customs relating thereto both in general and with respect to particular\ countries.\ scripture informs us that the athenians were very religious wherefore they\ as well as the romans lestthey should forget deity would rather set up an altar\ to an unknown god and make offerings thereon than be any ways negligent in\ the duty of worship from which altar st. paul took occasion to preach so\ powerful sermon touching christ and his gospel as thereby to bring over many\ souls to christanity.\ we must conclude that so many altars required many priests who were as\ different in drefs as the gods and manner of offering those of jupiier not at all\ like priapus\'92 nor diana\'92 those of bacchus as we shall shew in the sequel.\ the great laver of the jews evidences that their priests observed perfect\ cl\'e9anliness in their worship even the almighty himself ordered moses to put off\ his-shoes when he appeared to him in the burning bush and that any man or\ beast who touched the mount or its borders so long as he was present should\ be shot or stoned.\ it is not probable that the heathens were so nice in this- point nevertheless the present custom induces us to believe that their ancestors no less observed this\ decency\ decenev in their worship since to this day even christians are not allowed to\ enter the mosques of the mahometans though of all infidels they are the least ob-\ servers of religious ceremonies.\ think it not amiss to deride the agyptians in particular for paying divine\ honour to sonie beasts because most nations especially the greeks who excelled\ in wisdom and knowledge as likewise the strict romans were infected with the\ same superstition.\ marcrobius writes that king janus was the first who introduced and established\ in ltaly the offerings to the gods and that he himself was afterwards worshipped\ as such even so much that the ancient romans never sacrificed before they had\ invoked him as the inventor and protector of the offerings for they believed he\ always fat at the gates of heaven and that the prayers of mortals could not reach\ the gods if he denied them entrance nay he must even lend them an hand to go\ forward because prayers which homer calls women are lame and cripples.\ the most ancient nations who brought offerings of which the agyotians were\ doubtless the principal did not make use of beasts but herbs flowers trees and\ plants as likewise perfumes they therefore who anciently lived on beast\'92 flesh\ did it as reported for want of fruits and this on an opinion of pythagoras who\ forbid the eating of meat or blood as judging that the soul had its residence\ therein although eusebius relates the ancient divines maintained that no beasts even no meal honey fruits or flowers ought to be offered for says he god\ knows them who fear him and favourably accepts the poorest leaf they lay on the\ altar regarding their hearts and inclinations and not what they offer with their\ hands.\ it is certain that in old times detestable custom prevailed among almost all\ nations of butchering men for victims as we learn from credible authors was\ practised to diana taurica and not only the ancient soyrhians but also the agyp-\ tians and romans were infected with this cruelty the former offering such victims\ in honour to juno and the latter to jupiter called latialis whom they esteemed\ the protector of the latins sicinnius dentatus or the toothed as being so born very famous for martial exploits was the first among the romans who sacrificed\ men to mars athanasius relates that divers other nations after their return\ from conquest had custom of dividing their prisoners into hundreds and that\ one out of each as the unlucky lot fell was sacrificed to mars varro also testi-\ fies that the wandering trojans on their arrival at last in staly offered according\ to the oracle one man in ten to pluio and saturn anaeas as virgil informs us chose eight young gallants out of the prisoners he took of the enemy to sacrifice\ them to the gods of hell for the sake of pallas deceased diodorus siculus mentions that the people of carthage sacrificed to an idol of metal representing sciurn holding out its arms bent young men as burnt-offering by consuming them\ alive in the flames of red hot oven placed under this figure which offerings\ were long retained among those people till at last having them in abhorrence they put \'e0 live deer to the same usc yet some time after the death of alezander\ the great on being visited with the plague and the town closely besieged and re-\ duced to famine by agathocles king of sicily they according to the common cus-\ tom\ tom of nations had recourse to their imagined tutelar-gods prayers and old su-\ perstitions believing that saturn provoked by the change of offering which\ their ancestors with great devotion appropriated to him had as punshment caused this disaster and irreparable damage to befall them which opinion so in-\ fluenced on the minds of the citizens that they barbaroussy in one day offered two\ hundred others say three hundred youths of noble birth to that idol as an at-\ tonement the same writer adds that the phaenicians exceeded all other nations\ in that unnatural practice insomuch that in frantic extravagance and to ap-\ pease the imagined wrath of the idol saturn they sacrificed their own cnildren and afterwards abating that cruelty they made use of those of other men whom\ they secretly bought or stole-for this abominable purpose but plutarch that\ gelon king of sicily having vanquished the carthaginians in the battle of hymera forced them to promise never more to offer either ther own or other mens children\ in such manner quintius currius testifies that this cruel custom prevailed among\ the people of zyre till the destruction of that city and according to st.\ augustin the ancient gauls inhabitants of france as now called and several other\ nations were defiled with this abomination heliogabalus one of the greatest\ and most extravagant tyrants who ever sat on the roman throne caused all staly to\ be searched for beautiful and noble youths whose parents were still alive barbar-\ oussy and to the greater sorrow of their families to offer them as victims the\ jews are also not without reason much censured by aypion julian the apostate\ and others for having sacrificed men to idols abhorring the crueltv of jephthah chief of the gileadites in delivering up his daughter for burnt-offering this\ detestable superstition was not only prevalent among the heathens but also among\ the kings of judad the rulers of god\'92 chosen people in making their children\ pafs through the fire offering them up to moloch as we read of ahaz and manasseh kings xvi and xxi and as josephus de antig lib says after the manner of\ the canaanites cambyses king of persia and alexander the great after him by\ public and universal laws prohibited their subjects these abominable offerings yet not being long observed the emperor hadrianus under severe penalties in-\ tirely supprest them hercules first abolished the killing of men for sacrifice to\ suturn offeringhim so many burning lights in their stead and thereby reformed\ the inhuman custom this he did on his return from spain and assigned for\ reason that the greek word oos which the oracle of dodone had made use of\ for the institution of that solemnity signified light as well as man and that there-\ fore they were to offer to pluto \'e6 baked figures of clay and burning torches of\ candles instead of men for which cause they on the festivals of saturn called\ saturnalia made presents to one another of little figures and burning wax-candles.\ but lycurgus the lacedemonian legislator ordained that pigs should be used for\ victims instead of men.\ the image of dianna mentioned before which lphigenia and orestes had\ brought bound up in bundle of willow-branches from chersonesus tauricia now called grim was worshipped by the lacedemonians with great reverence.\ they\ they anciently offered it to men who were chosen by casting the lot this cru-\ el custom lycurgus altered thus they led youths to the altar of the idol and whiped\ them so long till according to their institution and the will of the oracle it was\ sprinkled with human blood and this was done to encourage young people not\ to fear the cuts and wounds they might receive from the enemy in battle.\ pltarch also relates that anciently when the plague had made sad havock at\ lacedemon the people were informed by the oracle that the infection would\ cease if they offered yearly some noble virgins the lacedemonians obeyed at\ last it happened that the lot fell on helena who being led for sacrifice an\ eagle descended and snatched the weapon out of the priest\'92 hand carrying it over\ field where he dropped on heifer aristides in his book of the italian\ state mentions the same accident formerly happening at rome to valeria lnperca.\ the head says hesychius bishop of ferusalem as having of all that is created treason is called understanding and has planted its seat in the heart god also\ formerly commanded that the head and liver and all that belonged to it should\ be burnt-offering tohim for from the heart and the liver come forth the springs\ and motions of our carnal appetites and in this sense st. paul blesses his con-\ igregation saying ee the peace of god which passes all understanding keep\ vour hearts and minds the prophet lsaiah says likewise ce the whole\ head is fick and the whole heart faint from the sole of the foot even unto the\ hcad there is no soundness in it '\ herodotus writes that the stythians worshipp\'92 divers gods but did not erect\ teither temples altars or images other than to mars altho their manner of sacri-\ fice was one and the same to all their gods and which think not improper to\ mention here the victim being brought to the appointed place with its fore-\ legs tied the priest followed striking it on the head which causing it to sink they thereupon invoked the god to whom it was to be offered then he threw\ rope about its neck and strangled it and pulling the skin and flesn from the\ bones heiput the same if they had no wood on the bones with other burning\ mixtures in order to boil it and if they wanted the n\'e6cessary kettles they put\ the flesh into the skin again and thus broiled it on the fire this being done the priest offered the victim to the god they intended but among all their vic-\ tims the horse was the chief which therefore they dedicated to mars whose\ temple when damaged and decayed by rains dampness and bad climate they retrieved in the following manner they gathered many branches twigs and chips of trees piling them into arge square heap made perpendicular on\ three sides and slopinig on the fourth so as conveniently to step on in the\ middle of this heap they laid large knife not unlike the present persian or\ turkissi scymitars which they imagined to be the true image of mars whom\ they worshiped and honoured with their offerings.\ that the horse was anciently first sacrificed to mars the histories of the grecks\ and romans plainly evince the annals of the lattertestify thatthey usedtooffery early\ tohim in the campus martius on the of december an horse which had won the\ prize in the race thereby besceching the god to favour their warlike enterprizes\ with success pausanias reports that jyndarus father of helena who was ravish-\ ed by paris and carried to troy having determined the utmost revenge asfembled\ all the grecian princes in conjunction with her consort menelaus vowing by the\ facrifice of an horse to revenge by sword the affront put upon him and his fa-\ mily some also pretend that the aforesaid festival kept on the of decem-\ ber has been celebrated on the of october and that the name of october was\ given to the horse appointed for those purposes on which occasion great\ contest one time arose at rome about the sacrificed horse\'92 head some insisting\ to have it on the capitol and others on tower of the city called manillia.\ the solemnities of this rite were performed in the following manner on the\ of october they led fine horse decked with garlands of greens intermix-\ ed with flowers and loaves of bread through the streets and quarters of the town and being arrived at the campus martius they there killed and offered him to\ mars for obtaining prosperity and fruitfulness this was done to beseech the\ god to prevent ruinous war in which the cavalry causes the greatest damage\ and destruction to the product of the field for it would be absurd to think that the romans who pretended to be descended from the trojans should offer\ the horse to mars after the greek manner and in conformity to the intention of\ jyndarus in order to be revenged of their ancestors wherefore it was only for\ the reason aforesaid the lacedemonians as festus affirms had also custom.\ of offering horse yearly on mount taygetus burning him to afhies for the wind\ to scatter into all their towns villages and districts and pausanias mentions that the macedonians sacrificed on the same mount an horse to the sun in imi-\ tation of the persians xenophon asferts the same in his memoirs when he relates that they made curio present of an horse for that purpose knowing it was\ the custom of the persians to honour the sun with such victim he says further\ that the sarmatans bred horses for sacrifice and sustenance the salenrines like-\ wise offered horses and afterwards burnt them in honour to jupiter the\ people of rhodes offered to the sun chariot with four beautiful horses which\ they drove into the sea to be swallowed up by the waves believing the sun ran\ round the world equipped in that manner we read in the heroic poems of phi-\ lostralus that in order to overcome their enemies they were obliged to offer to\ the sun white foal who had never known the bridle or spur this was done by\ the advice of palamedes to buoy up and animate the greeks who at the siege of\ troy were struck with frights and fears at the sight of sudden eclipse which\ then happened.\ origines intimates that the offering bullock before the tabernacle according\ to the ancient jewoissi rite signified that we must subdue all pride and haughti-\ ness and by calf the having overcome the weakness of the flesn.\ the baeotians had custom of sacrificing to neptune bullock called with\ them mucytes or bellowing because his noise has some affinity with that of the\ billows when violently agitated by the winds the bullocks which the priests\ selected for that deity ought to have dark or black hair thereby to signify the dark\ depths of the water wherefore many think that the eagle is called by the\ latins aquilla from the word aqua as having dark and blackisn colour for\ the same reason the sea-gods are usually represented with brown complexions bluish hair and garments and with full chests and broad shoulders like bul-\ locks to the taurii ludi or bull-solemnities in use among the ancient\ romans they were not instituted by them in honour to neptune but for the\ infernal gods whom they believed were thereby moved to compassion when\ under tarquinus superbus the city was affficted with plague which carried off\ abundance of women with child and the people imputed the misfortune to the\ eating the flesn of black bullocks.\ the sacrifices which the ronan censors used to offer every fifth year for their\ purification and called solitaurilia confisted of boar ram and bull.\ the offering bullock as we gather from history was generally especial-\ ly among the romans token of victory gained over the enemy according-\ ly juvenal says they led to the capitol large black bullock marked with chalk.\ but here it must be observed that the lacedemonians in some fort imitated the ro\'ac\ mans in several of their sacrifices of that nature for when the latter got victory\ by slaughter and taking the enemy prisoners they offered bullock but when\ without blood-shed sheep the lacedemonians contrarily sacrificed bul-\ lock on obtaining victory without cruelty or blood-shed and cock when it\ was got in the open field in pitched battle preferring enterprizes performed\ with reason and conduct to those effected by main force.\ we read likewife that anciently especially among the romans the bullock\ was so much regarded that it was as capital to kill one as to murder citizen.\ wherefore erichthaeus reigning at athens ordered that at the yearly festival wherein bullock was sacrifiiced the popa or priest whose duty required him\ to furnisn the cattle and cut their throats when knocked down should after\ the solemnity was over and in maintainance of the law forsake the town first\ leaving the ax at the foot of the altar.\ the thessalians were enjoined by the oracle of apollo at dodone to offer sacri-\ fice yearly on the tomb of achilles and to furnish the necessaries from their own\ country namely two tame bulls one black and the other white the wood\ from mount pelion the fire out of thessaly and slower and water from the river\ sperchius with these were to be used garlands and festoons of greens inter-\ mixed with amaranths that in case the ships bringing the necessaries from\ other \'e9ountries should be kept back by contrary winds at least such greens and flowers that never wither might not be wanting to hang on the tomb.\ apollodorus and athenaeus relate that hercules was so great an eater as often to-\ devour whole bullock at meal for wlich reason the ancients dedicated to\ him the water-fowl called by the gree\'e8s maoos in englissi sea-mew because\ this bird according to suidas is very voracious nay on account of this excess-\ in eating they brought him offerings whereby men were not allowed to use any\ other expreffions than cursing and swearing lactantius and apollodorus relate\ the story thus hercules on time travelling with some companions through\ rhodes and being very hungry met with country-man at plough with cou-\ ple of oxen which he desired to purchase for silling his belly but the man re-\ jecting the proffer hercules took the cattle by force and with his companions\ eat them up the other enraged and frantic hereat cursed and swore at hercu-\ les as he was eating who laughed and bantered him saying he never eat bet-\ ter morsel or with more gusto in all his life wherefore the inhabitants of\ that island erected an altar to him after his deification whereon was carved yoke\ of oxen offering thereon at certain timcs couple of oxen at which soleni-\ nity the priests and people bustled about and made great noise by cursing\ swearing and other impieties which they thought would please the god in re-\ membrance of the adventure with the plough-man.\ must subjoin another sacrifice to the honour and memorv of the deified\ hercules not less foolisn than ridiculous suidas relates that the baotians on certain time leading an ox for sacrisice he broke loose and ran away where-\ upon the mob unwilling to pretermit the time for celebration stuck an ap-\ ple on four sticks with two smaller on top representing four legs and two horns offering this with great solemnity to hercules others ascribe this apple sacrifice instead of an ox to the athenians and julius pollux testifies that it was long\ in use among the thebans yet pausanias in his memoirs reports that as the ap-\ ple-tree is sometimes accepted by the gods in token of propitious sacrifice so the baotians at the ox\'92 running away offered to hercules an apple-tree ha-\ ving but four branches instead of the four-legged beast whence it became after-\ wards customary to consecrate that tree to this god and apollodorus affirms ac-\ cording to zenodotus that those offerings of the baotians were instead of rams and\ sheep.\ the imploring help and favour by means of abullock reminds me of custom\ of the ancient scythians now called tariars who killing and stripping bullock the person who had received any injury from another took the skin spread it on\ the ground and sat upon it with his hands behind him and those who in passing\ by promised to give their affistance trod onthe skin with the right foot thereby\ signifying the means they proposed to use for the injured person\'92 satisfaction.\ this custom is largely described by lucianus treating of friendship under the\ name of toxaris and speaking of the homolois he says that when they de-\ ligned inviolably to engage themselves to each other they killed an ox and cut\ him intobits to give to people as they passed by which custom is still solemnly\ observed by the circassian tartars inhabiting between the rivers tanais and phasis.\ and all such passangers as get piece of such an ox think themselves so bound\ in friendship and so much obliged to the giver as not to scruple hazarding either\ goods or life in revenging the injury done to theirfriend.\ the athenians in thankful acknowledgment of the profitable labour of the ox stamped his image on their coin called didrachmum wherefore we read in\ homer and other writers that they used to buy merchandizes by certain num-\ bers of oxen as in the second book of his iliads he has it ce every thing of\ that kind is sold for hecatomb an hundred oxen or in better terms for\ an hundred pieces of gold or silver coin with their impress.\ pindarus mentions that the hyperboreans performed their hecatombs or\ great facrifices to apollo with asfes wherefore callimachus says that that god\ took delight in the killing fat afs\ but the agyptians hated this creature not only for his dulness and stupidity but also for his skin mixed with brown and white which they accounted abomi-\ nable and unfit to be offered to the gods accordingly they abused him as\ much as possible flinging stones and clods of dirt and mud and pricking him\ with sharp-pointed sticks and when in the pursuit they found him on conve-\ nient eminence they made him roll down it hence arose the comparative pro-\ verb applied to contemptible persons the afs of agypt.\ these people were not the only ones who paid honour to the hog other nations\ have ranked it with their gods for this creature was formerly sacred in candia where they believed that jupiter at his birth sucked sow which by her grunt-\ ing intirely drowned the cries of the child though some will rather afcribe this\ kindnefs to the goat of amalthea.\ the ancient stalian kings had custom to offer an hog in their nuptial solem-\ nities and the great in their nuptial feasts brought according to the tuscan\ manner an hog to the altar consecrating it to the tutelar gods and presiders over\ new married persons which was the general custom of the greeks as well as of\ the latins.\ they of argos celebrated the festival called hysteries by offering an hog in\ honour to venus of which callimachus largely treats though we find the sicyonians\ dedicated to her all kinds of beasts as aristophanes testifies saying they killed\ an hog to offer to venus.\ they likewise offered an hog to the goddess maja by whom is meant the\ carth thus called according to cornelius labeo as signifying greatness because\ this creature makes great havock among the corn and grain and is very prone to\ tear up the ground as horace says the hogs loves the mud for these beasts\ were facrificed to the gods either on account of their likeness and agreement or\ dissimularity and aversion wherefore the poets mention that the hog was first\ offered to ceres for the great mischiefit did to the corn veranius says they\ also offered sow to ceres after funeral for purifying the family.\ on making peace alliance or truce they offered an hog as virgil affirms he made the peace during the killing of sow though quintilian and servius in their remarks that virgil means an hog because in that solemnity was always\ used an hog or boar suetonius in the life of claudius caesar reports that he\ made an alliance with the princes during the offering of sow though tits li-\ vius speaks likewise of an hog.\ the mosait law enjoined tne king or princes to offer for their sins an he goat and those who had no public employments she goat or lamb aaron was com-\ manded to offer for himself and family calf as harmless or righteous and an\ he goat for sin offering and we learn from hesychius bishop of jerusalem that\ the\ greck word signifying an offering of an hundred beasts.\ the high-priest after having offered an he goat for burnt-offering was allowed\ to go into the holy of holies cloathed in white linen coat with girdle of the\ same and breeches and mitre of fine twined linen as signifying that being re-\ conciled to god purified in body and soul chaste sober and righteous filled\ with godly understanding and the gifts of the holy spirit he might enter into\ that place.\ the offering he goats and fheep under the law implies mortifying and rooting\ out all impurities and carnal justs as admantius explains it and to which cyril\ agrees for scripture hieroglyphically commonly takes the he goat for men\ plunged in stinking impure and all manner of extravagant desires as also\ plainly appears by our saviour\'92 words when at the-last judgment he will set\ the sheep or elect with all blessings on his right hand and on the lest those whoby stinking sin are unworthy of his pity for eternal punishment and after\ such manner the goat was brought to attone for fins when the law commanded that he should be presented alive before the altar and the priest laying his hands\ on the head should confess over him all the iniquities of the people and put\ them on the head of this lascivious creature and then by afit person send him\ away into the wilderness they add for confirmation that the thick and\ rough hair of this beast is laid upon him as stinking burthen of his lasci-\ viousness.\ the fables of the greek poets tell us that hercules was the first who tamed the\ lascivious he goat meaning that he overcame the wanton desires of the flesh.\ he likewise first offered this beast to juno for having vanquished hippocoon and thereby irritated the goddess he found no other victim at hand to appease\ her with as paufanias relates in his third book but the lacedemonians sacrificed\ to diana called the corythalian in the fields goats flesn only no other beast being\ allowed in that solemnity wherefore xenephon in his memoirs reports that\ when the persians invested achens with mighty force intending to ruin it intire-\ ly the athenians mode vow to diana to offer to her as niany goats as they should\ defeat enemies in case they beat them.\ the poets likewise mention that the goat was sacrificed to bacchus because he being the god of wine could not be more acceptably honoured than with the\ death of creature so noxious to vine-yards dedicated to him wherefore the\ festivals called ascolia were also celebrated in his honour when they laid on the\ ground at equal distances sacks or bags of goats fkins silled with wind which\ being smeared with oil or grease they merrily to win the prize lcaped from one\ upon the other tumbling by reason of the glibness over each other to the no\ small delight and applause of the people.\ the romanladies on being delivered with twins formerly offered to juno to\ whom empires and riches were facred certain sheep which according to bebius\ macer were tied between two pair of lambs on each side but the sicyonians cus-\ tom was to offer fat sheep by them called eumenides to the gods of benevo-\ lence and good hope for the good luck and prosperity of theirfamilies they\ likewise sacrificed to hercules as god of riches and plenty fheep tied on feur\ sticks instead of bullock who ran away as they were leading himn to the altar wherefore\ wherefore he is called melius or shepherd but of this ridiculous offering lhave\ said enough before.\ we gather from the greek and roman histories and antiquities that they sacri-\ ficed dogs the former to prosorpina and the latter to genetia at the festival\ called lupercalia sacred to the lycaan idol pan the romans offered the same knowing that the constant nature of dogs is to pursue wolves others think that\ this was done in honour and renrembrance of romulus who they said was in his\ infancy laid in wood and brought up by wolf some report that evander\ first introduced and established those solemnities the people of argos offered\ dogs to the goddess cyonia to whom they aicribed the power of giving women in\ labour an happy delivery the lacedemonians consecrated those creatures to mars\ \'92for their eagernefs and alacrity in falling on deer for the young men in their\ warlike exercises used to begin them with sacrificing little dog to mars as the\ strongest and most valiant of the gods judging that creature to be the most ac-\ ceptable of the tame and sociable animals the augures fort of priests among\ the romans also often sacrificed kind of red dogs before the town gate called\ from thence catularia or dogs-gate that the heat of the dog-days in july and\ august might not burn or spoil the trees and fruits of the earth the inhabitants of methone annually offered cock for the prosperity of the\ vineyards and for averting the violent south-east winds for when this wind\ rises in the blossoming time of the vines its malignity kill the young fhoots and\ frustrates the hope of future vintage wherefore the augures of that tract of\ land found it proper to order that two young men chosen for that purpose should at certain place take white cock and each holding leg above the\ spur by parting pull him to pieces and then with the piece of the cock in their\ hands running round the vineyards one to the right the other to the left till\ having as they thought made an atonement they met again at the place where\ the cock was torn to pieces and there buried him by blind luck it sometimes\ fell out that as long as they observed the solemnity the issue of things answered\ their desire.\ the ancient romans also used to sacrifice annually an hen to asculapius the\ god of health.\ the duck on account of its greedy and voracious nature was by the baeotians\ sacred to hercules whom they judged the greatest eater and glutton as the most\ acceptable to him.\ and according to zenodotus the phaenicians offered quail to the same god be-\ cause it once saved his life.\ the people of crene ascribed great honour in husbandry to saturn saying he\ was the inventor of planting grafting pruning and dunging wherefore in his\ solemnities they wore on their heads chaplets of fresh figs as well on account\ of their being food as dainty taste.\ the agyptians offered annually on the i day of the first month honey and\ figs in honour of mercury celebrating this feast with great noise and crying oh how sweet and agreeable is truth.\ the ancient gauls worshipped hercales as the god of prudence and as lucia-\ nus says eloquence even more than mercuzy because eloquence is accounted\ more consummate in aged men as hercules is generally represented than in the\ young wherefore they offered to him as tne agyptians did to mercury honey\ and figs moreover all who ministered held fig-tree branch in their hands and they as well as the priests had their heads adorned with popular leaves.\ virgil likewise mentions that evander offering to this god had chaplet of the\ same leaves about his head calling them hercules leaves and macrobius says that the ancient solemnities to saturn and hercules were performed bare-headed .\ but in those to other gods the priefts heads were covered.\ the ancient romans offered to the goddess carna to whom they ascribed the\ support of the animal spirits in human bodies bacon and the greens of beans whereby men are made strong and hearty for labour and it is certain that those\ people called the first day of june fabaria or bean\'92-day because that oblation was instituted by junius brutus of whom this month has also borowed its name.\ festus pompeius says that the romans annually offered to vulcan in june at the feast\ called the fishing-games fort of fisni for the souls of men because the ancient\ philosophers hieroglyphically represented the souls by fishes and as philo says because they consist of pure element and god created them the first of all living.\ creatures.\ vincent cartarie relates another custom of the romans that after victory ob-\ tained they piled all the shields and other weapons of the enemy in an heap and\ burnt them as an oblation to vuican which was done says servius in imitation-\ of tarquinius priscus who having overcome the sabines burnt all their weapons\ in honour of the same god and as evander mentions in virgil he did when.\ young and had gotten the victory at praeneste.\ the agyptians offered to lsis loaves and apples and the ancient sicilians acorns-\ and flour to ceres the heathenisn priests offered to the nymphs or water and\ field goddeffes white fillies on account of their purity as serapis is reputed.\ by the agyptians the god of riches or the productions of the earth being the in\'ac\ ventor of sowing and tillage he is therefore by them represented with basket\ of fruits of the earth on his head even his offerings whether of meat bread .\ fruits or flowers were carried in baskets.\ we see that the jug is commonly sacred to ofiris not only on account of his be\'ac\ ing master and inventor of wine but also of all moisture wherefore he is called\ ocean and isis thetis for it was the custom to carry ajug in the procession of the\ offerings thereby to shew their veneration for this god keeping large one in\ particular esteem to carry it covered with great solemnity to the temple where\ being arrived they kneeled down and with lifted up hands thanked the god\ for his loving kindness to men as believing that all things were brought forth by.\ moisture.\ in certain place in greece they worshipped myngrus god of the fties when the\ people offered to him all the flies retired from those parts the grenenses iii bia\ al so honoured the god of flies called achor making offerings to hiin sor stopping\ the plague which sometimes was occasioned by the multitude of those inseets.\ anciently\ anciently they offered red wine instead of blood for moses in his song in\ deureronomy says es and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape in his psalms ee they have drank the blood of the grape indeed the\ aepyptim priests some of whom were kings intirely abstained from wine but\ always used it in their offerings not as an acceptablenefs to heaven but to signify\ the blood and punissiment of those who rebelled against the gods and thereby to\ obtain favour and reconciliation for the agyptians firmly believed that wine sprang\ from the blood of the discomfitted giants which on their rising against the gods and threatening to storm heaven was spilt on the earth and therefore made men\ commit all manner of extravagancies they also intimated by the wine-press per-\ fecution adversity vexation and oppression.\ the romans on the other hand celebrated the feast of mercury with milk only\ to express thereby the sweetness of eloquence those rites were performed at\ rome in the street called sobrius or sober because wine has many strange effects as disclosing of secrets running rashily into dangers weakness of the legs faultering of the tongue wandering senses and other imperfections.\ slaughter of beasts but also with festoons and garlands of flowers and with the\ tinkling noise of copper and iron instruments tabors harmonious sounds haut-\ boys pipes .\ to finisn this chapter let me add that anciently it was the custom of many\ nations to make on the face of the altar circle or ring with the blood of the\ victim carefully and with great devotion savingit in vessel for that purpose.\ this solemnity they called by word which signifies making perfect saying that the round was the most perfect of all figures.\ ch ap xix of the sacredotal dresses vessels and other materials\ pertaining to offerings.\ the preceding chapter more complete thought it necessary to say\ something here of the sacredotal dresses vessels believing it may be\ of service to the curious artists whose constant employments will not always al-\ low them to peruse the authors treating of those matters.\ when the agyptian priests for the sins of the people put up prayers for avert-\ ing the wrath of god they were dressed in black to signify that mortals pro-\ ceeding from usual earth besought and intreated that invisible being on be-\ lief that no other coloured dress was more proper.\ it is likewise general custom of the principal and most polite nations to dress\ in black at times of humiliation and those who mourn make use of the same co-\ lour wherefore varro calls them anthracini or as black as coals.\ the\ the arcadians also worshipped ceres goddess of the fruits of the earth in\ black cloaths and the priests of the idol falacer to whom they attributed the\ care and inspection of the fruits of the trees wore commonly black caps but in\ their solemnities all black the black was also dedicated to pluto and in offering\ to him the priests were in this colour believing that it best suited the hellisn or\ subterranean gods.\ herodotus to shew that the heathens agree with the present opinion touching\ the signification of cleanness testifies that the agrptians did not allow the wear-\ ing in their temples any cloaths made of wool but they had white linen gar-\ ments terfullian speaking of our saviour therefore says as he is dressed in the\ garb of white linen it is the same with that of ofiris and plutarch treating of lsis\ and ofiris takes this to be the reason why the priests make use only of white linen\ garments to signify that all clean and undefiled things best agree with the nature\ of the gods whose pure and sacred majesty according to plato ought not to be\ worshipped by things impure and filthy and as linen is the clearest dress and\ can be very easily wafhed and made beautiful so it was thought the most becom-\ ing the sacredotal dignity and purity and indeed the magii or priests of the\ ancient perfians said that god took delight in white garments which assertion\ seems to be borrowed from solomon who in his exhortations to good and blame-\ \'97let your garments be always white less manners and pure conscience says as if he meant \'97take heed in all your actions not to be defiled with evil and\ uncleanness. the priestly vestment called poderis from the greek word podes in englissi feet was of fine white linen setting close to the body and hanging down to the\ feet ancient divines say that thereby they signified the most holy and mysterious\ doctrine this was the undermost covering as we find in exod xxxix and\ they made coats of fine weaved linen and their garment called hypodytes of\ hyacinth colour intimating heavenlynefs and that men ought to raise their\ minds thoughts and faculties thither forsaking what is earthly the priests\ also wore under their coats breeches of fine twined linen covering their privities\ and thighs as an admonition to drefs and appear in chastity they were likewise\ enjoined by the offertorial law to be girt with girdle embroidered with blue purple and scarlet hieroglyphically implying fortitude strength and virtue.\ the romissi priests use to this day white linen garments in their service as did\ al so apollonius zyaneus to whom they seemed more agreeable with cleannefs than\ others woven of foul and greasy wool.\ the shoes of the agyptian priests were not made of other matter than the bark\ of trees so cautious were they in avbiding the least appearance of unchastity and\ uncleanness accordinglv and with respect to purity it was great crime\ among the roman prestesses called flaminica to wear shoes of skins of beasts\ which died natural deaths superstitiously believing it to be abominable but they\ approved of such as were made of offered beasts skins- our saviour himself com-\ manded his disciples not to wear shoes that being with all speed to publisn ever-\ lasting life they might intierly forsake what is corruptible moses also leaving\ the agyptian bondage wore shoes of beasts skins intimating his affinity with mor-\ tality\ tality but afterwards as he grew in strength and virtue and was to serve the al-\ mighty he was commanded to pull them off.\ the egyptian priests adorned their heads with hawk\'92 feathers thinking to\ owe this honour to that bird because as they say he formerly brought the\ priests of thebes in agypr book written in red letters containing the manners\ of worshipping the gods and many of the principal rites to be observed in their\ offerings wherefore the latin poets according to martial call those priests\ copped or crested.\ it would be needless to say more touching the sacred dresses such as the mitre bonnet ephod and other ornaments since they and every thing else relating to\ the priest-hood are amply described by goeree in his jezoijhi antiquities where-\ fore after having touched on the hair of the priests we shall only treat of the\ ancient roman priest-hood.\ it was formerly the greatest scandal and indignity for man to have his hair\ cut off and possibly moses therefore commanded the priests not to have their\ beards or hair taken off with razor but dlipped with scifsors to distinguish\ them from those of the agyptians who after the death of apis deified and\ worshipped by them had not only their heads but their whole bodies shaved that in their sacrifices they might be pure moreover according to bede in his\ church-history by shaving the head is meant renouncing superfluous riches\ which priests by their institution are punctually to observe and that hair is to\ be accounted but as superfluity of the body and in this sense speaks hierony-\ mus that as the priest hashis head shaved so he ought also to cut and cast off\ superfluous riches and earthly desires and that by the little hair left is signified that they must be content with small provision for supporting their mortal bodies.\ others add that the little hair left on their heads in the form of crown de-\ notes the crown of eternity with which after their conssicts they were to be\ rewarded.\ but as for the law commanding to cut the hair round and to shave the beard many think it proceeded from the abominable abuse of the heathens who offered\ their own hair and that oftheir children to the devil.\ on the other hand divers councils decreed that the priests in imitation of\ the nazariies should keep theirhair and beards and let them grow with inten-\ tion that by seeing and handling the same they might always remember their\ duties wherefore they did not shave but dlip their hair with sciffors that it\ might not over-grow but to return to the romans.\ numa pompilius their second king and priest when he could no longer alone\ bear the weight of the government and discharge the duties of the priest-hood instituted three priests called flamines the sirst in honour to jupiter capitolinus the second to mars and the third to romulus quirinus their drefs was much\ like that of the present romissi clergy in their service on their heads they had white hat with an olive sprig upon it at the extremity whereof appeared tuft of wool taken from facrificed sheep this hat was called albogolerus.\ afterwards numa ordained twelve other priests called salii in honour to mars\ the\ the conqueror protector avenger and peace maker these were dressed in\ long loose garments or coats having breast-piece of copper enriched with gold silver and divers precious stones the solemnities growing numerous and at\ length amounting to above thirty thousand numa increased the number of priests\ accordingly he created the feciales and pater patratus who proclaimed war also the epulones or overseers of all sacred banquets and augures or soothsayers whose authority was so great that the senate could not assemble without their\ consent they had all particular garbs except when they officiated at which\ time their drefs was alike being garment of white linen very wide and\ reaching to their heels girt with girdle and buckle about their bodies this\ garment they called gabinus.\ and as ficlelity ought to be close that is the matters we are intrustedwith\ must be kept secret pure and inviolable.. numa ordered that the high-priest in\ offering to fidelity shouldkeephis right hand covered with white garment as tertul-\ lianobserves to signify that sincerity ought to be preserved simple and upright and\ that it is sacred to the right hand since we are to assert it with alacrity virgil like-\ wise intimates that the firmness of sincerity is signisied by the right hand as pledge or asfurance wherefore dido in his fourth aneid complains es alas these are the gilded words and promises of the son who as is said carries with\ him sacred things and household gods and in his third aneid we read ee fa-\ ther anchises himself gives the dejected youth achemenides the right hand -as \'e0 token\ of his sincerity to him and in another place amata says to latinus where\ is your sincerity were the former care for your kindred and your word and\ hand so often given to your nephew turnus \'92 virgil also calls fidelity white\ and grey meaning according to servius that sincerity is most found in old\ people who are grey and white horace complaining of the wickedness of his own\ times says that sincerity dressed in white is little worshipped adding that in\ the offering toit the high-priest keeps not only the right hand covered with the\ white garment but also his head and almost his whole body to shew that the\ heart and will ought to be pure and immaculate and always to accompany sin-\ cerity wherefore aristo also says sincerity was formerly represented in white\ dress.\ petronius r\'e9ports that numa himself for badge of priesthood wore small\ linen cap like the priests and soothsayers in their services as did likewise the\ wives and maid-servants of the roman priests called flamines.\ the hat also among the ancient romans denoted the sacredotal dignity for\ the flamines took their names from pileus or hat as if they would say pilea-\ mines though others are of opinion their name is derived froin flammeum which\ among them was an head ornament for the bishop-like caps long coats and\ garments were as lhave said peculiar to the priests the authority and credit\ of the illustrious fabius pictor iduces us to believe this when he says that the\ priests or flamines were not allowed to appear publicly without the hat or cap but that in their houses they were at their own liberty custom to this day\ strictly observed in many places by the romissi prelates.\ infula was fine white linen garment with which the priest and victim were\ covered.\ when the vestal virgins offered they were dressed in long and wide vest-\ ment of very fine white linen called susfibuium their heads were likewise\ wound with white garment and over it was vail of white linen hanging down\ square and coming over their cheeks and fastened under the chin with clasp\ or buckle wherefore they were called vestals from the word vestis the romissi\ women wear to this day long vails pretending to imitate the virtuous ancient\ matrons who covered their heads necks and breasts with them and kept them-\ selves so chaste and reserved as never to seperate from their husbands nor giving\ the least opportunity for evil.\ besides the before-mentioned dresses the priests had divers implements and\ sacred vessels for offerings viz.\ prafericulum vessel of brass wide on top and without an handle.\ patinu or patera dish or platter whereon the priests saved the blood of the\ victims.\ achana another small vessel in the form of cup in which they saved the drop-\ pings of the wine at the offerings.\ acerra was small box in which the perfume was kept.\ enclabris was the table whereon lay the sacred things whence the utensils and\ other materials for the offerings were called enclabria on this table they laid\ the beast to be offered cut open and stretched out carefully turning with knife and inspecting the entrals to wit heart lungs and liver in order to prognosti-\ cate future events to the common and silly people piusanias reports that the\ gree\'e8s observed the same methods in their sacrifices.\ cecespita so called secando from cutting was pretty long knife having\ round ivory handle tipped with gold and silver and studded with copper.\ with this they cut the victim\'92 throat.\ struppi was bundle of herbs called verbena mixed with laurel myrtle and\ olive sprigs they were of opinion that these presaged happiness and prosperity\ in their offerings they even used them in their purifications silling also and\ making pillows thereof for their imagined deities.\ aspergillum or holy-water-sprinkle was made of sprigs and leaves of hyssop which in marble vessel called labrum they placed at the entrance of their\ temples according to the present romish custom and with which they sprinkled\ the by-standers and congregation.\ they had divers other rites which for brevity shall pass over what have\ said is only to let artists see how diligently they ought to consult history that by\ that means they may in their productions follow antiquity in all its particulars and so duly order and represent things that lovers may say with applause no-\ thing is wanting th ar of painting\ book\ of statuary.\ emblem touching statuary.\ young and sturdy maid having an hard look stands with her\ right leg on square plinth and the left on globular body.\ tucked up behind before she has sheep'-fleece\ garment is light grey fastened above the knee with button and\ waiste her sleeves are turned up above the elbows on her left\ arm she holds the figure of decorum and in that hand chisel pair of com-\ passes line and square and in the other mallet her locks and tresses are\ tied behind with broad fillet which comes about the head whereon appears small altar and an eagle grasping thunder.\ chap of statuary in general.\ rewe proceed to the qualities and operations of statuary we shall as an\ introduction say somewhat of its antiquity.\ baedalus as famous for architecture as statuary was of royal extraction cad-\ mus himself to whom thebes owes its rise was king\'92 son as those sciences\ then\ then take their origin from the ancient gree\'ebs shall not trace their inventors\ down to the remains of the ifraelites nor to those who bestowed their art on the\ costly and magnificent temple of solomon the cherubins and ornaments of the\ ark or the vessels consecrated to worship scripture is so express in these things that we must be convinced these arts were also in great use at that time.\ the vast pains is knovn which the children of seth took in engraving and\ transmieting to posterity their inventions and skill in astronomy on two columns one made of baked clay and the other of stone in order that that art threaten-\ ed with destruction by the flood and violent waters might remain intire to future\ ages and that after the flood prometheus son of japhet was the first inventor\ of images which has given rise to all the fables and fictions of the poets.\ the assrrians and chaideans had knowledge in statuary as we gather from laban\'92\ having houschold gods which his daughter rachel stole from him and after-\ wards from the jezys making golden calf in the wildernefss by mount sinai for worship.\ the heathens applied themselves to inquiries into arts with very good success.\ ninus son of belus in scripture called nimrod the first king of asspria immortal-\ ized his father\'92 memory by building to his honour temple embellished with\ statues and especially with the idol baal in order to be worshipped the obe-\ lisks or pyramids brought to rome by augustus out of agypt are standing evi-\ dences of the greatnefs of that people in their works. the ancient statuaries instruct us in thousand pretty inventions and circum-\ stances in history which they unriddle teaching us the customs worship differ-\ ent dresses arms of the ancients things very well worthy of our study.\ it is likewise not for want of judgment that the antique statues are proposed to\ us as the most perfect models of elegance and symmetry because the age where-\ in alexander lived was the most perfect we know of for carry ing arts and sciences through the emulation of that time to the highest degree of perfection in order\ to which they began with painting and statuary framing some patterns from\ whence might be laid down certain and positive rules not to be departed from without spoiling order and beauty the famous statuaries of those times there-\ fore employed their whole wits in prosecuting the work unanimoussy and en-\ deavoured to make exact inquiries into the beauty of nature and what shape\ and proportion the several parts of the body ought to have in order to form\ thereout an intire perfect and harmonious whole yet it being impossible for\ them to bring all the collected parts into one and the same object they concluded\ to chuse the principal and most beautiful parts out of several bodies in order to\ compose from them different perfect figures to serve posterity for patterns and\ models.\ chap ii of the execution of statuary.\ statuary is an imitation of nature performing its work by strong mo-\ tion of the body and dexterity of the hands it consists in the symmetry or\ exact division of the objects according to the particular qualities especially in\ human figure wherein it most excels and next in quadrupeds all relieved and\ conformable to the life.\ its other performance concerns the bafs relief or half round work according\ to its different qualities as we shall hereafter explain.\ the materials for statuary are of five sorts and each of particular nature and\ qaulity.\ the first is clay.\ the second wax.\ the third wood.\ the fourth ivory.\ the fifth stone.\ the two first are worked with wooden tools and the rest with sharp irons and\ each material requires particular handling from the first something is taken\ off to the second something is added in the third is cutting in the fourth scraping and in the last driving or thrusting according te the nature of the\ matter either soft or hard solid dry or brittle.\ in an human figure or other creature statuary first sketches its thoughts on\ paper making choice of the most beautiful side and then takes clay and sets\ those conceptions upright and as like the design as possible the figure being\ now roughed out with the proper tools or rather with the fingers the life is set to\ the same posture in order to finisn after it and being brought to this forward-\ ness the artist proceeds gradually round till all sides are finished and nothing is\ wanting the work standing in this condition for some time to dry is afterwards\ baked in an oven and then may serve as model for carving in marble or other\ matter.\ the esfence of this art lies in beautiful form and neat or distinct represen-\ tation of the things we would make whether human figures beasts or other ob-\ jects of which the principal are figures and bafs reliefs.\ the first considers man woman and child of all ages as likewise portraits\ or busts.\ the second respects the horse camel elephant lion and other beasts and the last regards the peacock eagle raven owl and other such creatures oc-\ curring in this art all requiring an exact knowledge.\ seeing therefore that so many things are necessary to be understood think it\ of the last consequence that the artist before he begin sculpture be well acquaint-\ ed.\ ed with the grounds of drawing and for two reasons first in hopes of honour\ and advantage and secondly for fear of prejudice and reproach these two\ considerations always attend the master and one of them unavoidably depends on\ his knowledge and performance for as the work is of great consequence and\ charge as well in the materials as tools and slow procefs so if it succeed well it brings reputation and gain otherwise greater lofs and blame.\ atrue artist ought not to be without the following works viz the statues\ of perriea -the lconology of casar ripa -- oudaan\'92 roman might and other\ hooks of antiquities also the principal histories but chiessy les characteres des\ passions by monsieur de la chambre and other authors on the same subject together\ with those of dresses and of beasts and other animals and for practice he\ ought to be furnished with plaister figures bafs reliefs medals busts hands and\ feet lions and lionesses sphinxes terms and manv other things which are to\ be bought as likewise models of wax and clay and on paper.\ chap iii of bafs reliefs.\ that may proceed in an orderly manner shall begin with bafs reliefs of which there are three forts viz almost relief halt relief and faint or\ slat and the difference of these ought to be well considered as they have three\ particular intentions in their proportions or divisions.\ the first fort or almost relief is commonly used in deep niches with figures\ in full proportion having three grounds behind one another the foremost figures\ are almost relief the second half relief and the third somewhat less.\ the second fort or half relief is used in shallow square niches frontispieces circular-headed upper doors and niches this has two grounds or depths the\ first is half-relief and the second somewhat fainter.\ the third fort is proper for frizes pedestals balustrades and medals this\ has but one depth or single figure on one ground.\ in their ordonnance four things are to be observed.\ that the principal figure of the work have its full relief and those of the\ least consequence most faint and sticking to the ground.\ that the greatest motion and action of the figures be always in profile yet\ without any fore-shortening of the members.\ that the setting on of the projecting parts appear natural not forced.\ that the work be eqully divided and distributed every where alike not too\ full in one part and too empty in another which is point of great importance.\ although these bafs reliefs seem chiesly to concern statuaries yet they as much\ affect painting on account of the particular relation the two arts have to each\ other in that one can not be perfect without the other the statuary borrows\ from the painter the ordonnance or disposition for the ground of his work which\ he\ he afterwards put in practice the painter on the other hand learns of the statu-\ ary the method of modelling as necessarily serving for \'e0 foundation in the per-\ formance of bass-relief wherefore think painter can not possibly paint good one unless he understand something of modelling nor good statuary give\ satisfaction without having some skill in painting.\ judicious master ought to be exact in ordering these bafs-reliefs that each re-\ ceiving its proper light all may appear distinct and without the least alteration.\ sun-fhine or sharp shades make things look otherwise than they really are by the\ mis-shapen ground-shades which on these occafions are seen in nature when the\ work being much raised has many deep hollows.\ large and universal light is most advantageous for the first fort or al-\ most relief.\ light somewhat more from the side is most proper for the second or half\ relief because it has but few risings and the work is therefore more free from\ ground-shades and direct side light is best for the third or fainter sort as giving it great deco-\ rum and elegance though it be almost without shade.\ this doctrine touching the light may possibly seem strange to some viz.\ that it ought to be governed by the bass-reliefs or pictures which are to stand or\ hang in it according as they are more or less relieved but we must conceive that proper light ought to be chosen for each sort of bass-relief from this con-\ sideration that the light is not equally good every where here suits bass-relief\ in deep niche there one less rising and here again one that is quite flat the\ one being thus lighted from -side and the other fronting nevertheless it must\ not be thought that according to the make of the room the disposition of the\ windows and the places fixed for niche on each side of the chimney it is in our\ choice to have in one of those bass-relief of three grounds and in the other\ one of two grounds or one because that which is nearest to the windows receives\ more fronting light than the other wherefore they ought to be alike hollow\ and raised by proper light we mean that the work must be so ordered that\ each part according to its light get good decorum for instance in the for-\ mer niche where the figures are much raised they can not give such large ground-\ shades since the light falls on them little fronting but it may happen in the\ other where the light comes more from the side unless you placed the figures\ which in one niche are on the right side in the other on the left thereby to pre-\ vent the superfluous shades elegantly reconcile the difference of the lights.\ the bass-reliefs in shallow niches with two grounds require as nice an obser-\ vation and the same conduct is necessary in frizes pedestals and medals.\ many err in placing bass-reliefs in frizes of chimneys on pedestals and over\ room-doors even upon the breast-work of the chimney itself setting there more\ than half relieved nay whole relicved figures as once saw an almost relief on\ single ground in chimney-frize in my opinion it is very- improper to in ake\ figures of nine inches length so very distant from each other and so little drape-\ ried sometimes figure has scarce three or four folds the work looking then to speak in painter-like terms more like smooth dead-colouring or rather old\ and worn out than new made and fhould by right be exeouted as faint and fine\ again have observed that painters in representing bass-reliefs in such places avoid all large shades as much as possible especially in frizes pedestals and other\ flats it being in my opinion very proper that those parts of architecture keep\ their flatness and as all ornaments viz capitals foilage modilions triglyphs and the like are in such case commonly performed neat and curious so our\ figures ought likewise to be perfectly finished.\ some keep too much to the great manner but the smaller the things are es-\ pecally within doors and near the neater they must be for without-doors the\ case is different because they receive light from all sides and are less set off be\ they ever so much raised wherefore statuary joined to architecture in such\ manner as it ought to be is the business of judicious artist and for which no\ one is qualified without great practice.\ as this study concerns painter as well as statuary ishall shew the former in\ how many different manners bass-relief may be painted and seeing the most ex-\ peditious is always the beft snall lay down that which by experience have\ found to be the best.\ first paint my cloth neat and even with such colour as my bass-relief re-\ quires whether white grey red yellow between light and shade or in\ second tint drawing my ordonnance on this ground correctly and strongly\ trace it over with-black lead and after rub it with dry cloth that it may stick fast\ and refist the varnisn without muddling then ivarnish it all over and proceed to\ painting first the shade and then the second tint against it leaving the ground\ for the light and uniting the shade with the second tint airily without softening\ them with fitch scumble the second tint either with finger or stif pencil in-\ to the ground then take another tint as dark as my model directs and\ with it give ground behind my figures leaving the work on the right side with-\ out the least relief being to finish rub the whole work or as much as can do at\ once with lighter tint than the first ground and so very thin and even that\ every thing may appear through it observing here that the white must be very\ stiff and thined only with turpentine on this wet ground clap my main lights which then as well as the shades will gradually unite with it without touching\ each other.\ the second and third sorts may be easily finished up at once the re-touching ex-\ cepted as having neither ground-shades nor hollows the method is this.\ my\ cloth being prepared as aforesaid ifirst heighten scumbling the main light into\ the wet ground which by the running of the turpentine oil is become somewhat\ tacky do the same with the shade leaving the ground in this condition for\ the second tint if the work is to be very neat rub it over with good varnisn\ mixed with some fat white oil that it may not dry so soon and that may with\ ease and as long as please paint upon it heightening on the most relieved parts and giving dark rouches in the hollows scumbling also here and there some smalt\ with soft fitch and some yellow in the reflexions of the shades if the back-\ ground ought to be little darker now is the time for doing it because then it\ will no more go in.\ the last sort needs no other ground than the first and it ought to be neat and\ clean because the light on one side and the shade on the other make the work\ relieve and rise sufficiently yet let us observe that as often as we paint or re-touch it must be rubbed over with varnisn or at least where necessary to prevent it'\ going in for such is the nature of varnisn that it will bear but one painting \'f4therwise the work sinks presently.\ we shall now shew what is to be observed in painting figures in dep niches work not to be performed either with respect to the figures or ground-fhades without due knowledge in perspective whatever applause ignorants may get from\ those who do not understand it.\ his blunder was great who painting figure in niche with stick in his\ hand shewed the ground shade of the stick very plainly on the hollow of the\ niche but gave none to the leg which supported the body save little on the\ plinth next the foot most sad conductl another simple young fellow seeing\ his master paint grey figure in niche and being told that the ground shade\ was of much importance and ought also to correct and being at the same time\ shewn the model it was painted by went immediately and got niche made but\ for want of figure he borrowed his master\'92 and set in the niche tracing there-\ in the ground-shade with black lead agreeable to which he gave all his figures\ in what action soever the same ground-shade.\ now it is certain that things painted on firm places ought that they may\ look natural to have their proper ground-shades according to the relief well ob-\ serving whence they receive their light fronting or sideways how far\ they are from the light in order to determine as one somewhat short sharp and\ strong as being near the light and the others longer fainter and more melting in\ proportion as they go off from it.\ as furtherance to the artist shall treat somewhat ofthe painting on wood-\ den vases urns cisterns and the like or on other smooth objects.\ as things painted on smooth objects standing in large and wide places can\ have no relief or projecture on the sides when seen fronting so rising and project-\ ing ornaments such as raised figures lions-heads festoons and the like are ve- ry improper and unnatural on them unless being fixed and immoveable they\ were seen but from one side for then you may paint as strong and relieved\ things upon them as you please avoiding the side going off since the smooth\ roundneis of the figure does not admit it the moveable objects which are\ used and seen from all sides must have fronting light and be painted vey flat\ or faint and with no rising swells and the ground of what colour soever it is be\ laid in such manner that what is painted on it whether figure or other object be set off by dark tint in its out line and this to be darker or lighter as it\ ought to be more or less rounding yet the main light must be somewhat strong-\ er than the ground.\ as to the colours there are many which agree well together lapis lazulli in-\ laid with gold also green serpentine with white as marble or plaister touch-\ stone porphpry agate and others on wood of any sort suits ivory-work pro-\ vided the former be not of too light colour like palm or olive-trec in the\ uile\ use of gold it ought to be laid on such tint as you think fit so as it may be\ heightened with shel-gold on the most relieved parts and afterwards varnished.\ in these countries holland statuary is of small account little advantage is to\ be gained by marble or other stone and though here and there in garden or\ other place figure or child is to be made in free-stone yet that is too trivial for\ good master but it is otherwise in italy where there are so many magnificent\ buildings and mostly enriched with carving and statuary in fine that country\ is land of promise to one who understands his business he gets money and has\ the esteem of the great on this account \'e0 statuary in our country ought to be\ somewhat acquainted with painting as being obliged to make virtue of neceffi-\ ty iknew one who for this reason applied so much to painting that he chang-\ ed the stone into cloth and his chisels into pallet and pencils for said he peo\'ac\ ple here will scarce pay for cloth much less lay out so much money for block\ of marble it is certain they can not always carry such heavy baggage along with\ them speak with respect to those who hang their houses galleries halls or\ apartments with cloths and cause them to be painted with statues and bass-reliefs which at any time in case of removal fire or other acidents they may roll up and\ hang in other rooms which otherwise they could not do at least it is better\ than to paint every thing on the walls themselves as was the former custom since this country is not like ltaly or france where the painting in fresco as di-\ vers palaces and churches of some hundred years standing can testify sufficiently\ pays for trouble and charges.\ chap iv of the force property and management of bass-reliefs.\ think an artist ought never to be at loss for matter in this point either for the pencil or chisel because it is to be furnished not only from\ tne fables emblems and bacchanals but likewise from scripture.\ have formerly in the book of ordonnance proposedthe story of judah and tha-\ mar which according to bass-relief management is with little alteration as well\ as many others very improper for it when you would represent two or three\ grounds in the same piece though that story require not so much depth and how\ sine would such bass-relief become the hall either of jeip or christian and if\ herein the servant and the country house were on particular ground how plain-\ ly would the matter appear if naturally expressed for though many imagine\ that bass-relief is in the same case with medal which tends only to commemo-\ rate this or that occurrence or remarkable story imust entirely deny it since in\ my opinion the chief intention of the former is in an instructive manner to serve\ for adorning building and\'92the plainer more artful and intelligible the bet-\ ter it is especially when the choice of subject is our own and we can go to the\ expence of it yet painted bass-reliefs ought as well as good picture to have\ their\ their property as the ancients who brought this art to such perfection have\ sufficirntly shewn in their sine remains which are our best models.\ agree with others that without an exact observation and enquiry into antiqui-\ ty and the comments thereon which some ingenious men have left us we\ ghould bealmost strangers to the hieroglyphic sense of the antique bass-reliefs or many of them are so foreign and dark that we can scarce apprehend what the\ ancients would signify by them.\ we shall therefore make some remarks onthe long and small yet sine bass-relief\ of meleager killed by his mother when she burnt the fatal wood it is certain\ that this story is faintly represented but in my opinion the master has omitted\ the bustle and violent stir of meleager\'92 body in order to preserve the elegance of\ the action find it also not strange that few can understand this story without\ some writing under it we there see the parcae or three fatal sisters but nothing\ of the mother and though we suppose diana to be present and mourning yet\ that circumstance does not fully clear the meaning meleager should rather have\ had his hunting equipage and dogs by him in order to point out his person and\ inclinations and though the burning of the wood seem in some measure to ex-\ press the matter yet think it too neatly cut and smooth and should be more\ like afire brand but my greatest wonder is at the absence of the mother althea she who was principal person great princess and acted this tragedy out of\ revenge and seeing it is one of the greatest effects of revengeful temper to\ triumph in the presence of those who are overcome moreover we see no active\ passions rule in any part of the composition nor can say who the woman sit-\ ting by him is whether his mother diana atalanta or who else can not be-\ lieve she is his mother because he seems to be as old as she moreover we do\ not perceive in him any motion of person in pain nor can apprehend\ the design of the face on the round board below on the ground it not being medal for ornament though doubtless placed there by the artist for some reason.\ some think it represents rage or trouble or else fire because the hair seems to be\ flaming but the matter might have been better expressed by pressing of the\ eyes strugling of the arms and legs contraction of the nofe mouth fingers and toes and the trouble and pain of the dying person whercas here we see no-\ thing like it but contrarily he seems to die very quietly as his arms lying close\ to his body at full length sufficiently shew besides it is against the rule of em-\ blems to admit of any aid where the fact can be performed by the person himself much less the addition of two or three figures to express the meaning unless they\ be statues such as tyranny with nero ambition with alexander valour with scipio and so forth.\ it is true that painters used formerly before they were acquainted with ex pres-\ sing the pasfions in the face and gestures to write them on scrolls proceeding from\ the figures mouths that they might thereby be understood but as artists are now\ more enlightened it would certainly be very improper to set cock or spur by man sitting or standing in order to shew his industry or scul by another in order\ to shew that he is dead .\ by these observations it is apparent that our meleager should rather have been\ known by sine action and motion since the chief end of representation is to.\ exprefs naturally and with energy the nature of the matter and this may as well\ be done in bafs-relief as paintied if the story require it nevertheless we must\ observe that there are some passions which do not work externally and ought to\ be expressed by additions in order to make them intelligible such may be cha\'ac\ rity mercy piety liberality and the like but anger madness or rage pain smart which disturb the body as well as the mind by irritating the mem-\ lers do not require emblematic figures or aditional explanations.\ chap of the draperies of statues and bass-reliefs.\ mong the greck statues we find none but what seem to be dressed in one fort\ of stuff and these are the models for good statuary of painter to govern\ himself by but portrait which is likewise an ornamental image must never be\ like statue or stone figure though white and painted with single colour even\ were ovid with his train of metamorphoses present no fine disposition of folds\ is here the advantage if the stuffs be not like those of the gree\'e8s they are not\ proper for stone and seem lefs congruous with antiquity.\ let us therefore not flatter ourselves that we can make any improvements by\ seeking new stuffs for our figures nor rely too much on the dexterity of our hands that how brittle soever the stones are we can work them and perform any thing even folds as thin as paper small flying draperics loose hair-locks hanging on\ but rather imitate the greeks in the thinnefs pliableness and looseness of their draperies that the beautiful sway of the moving\ parts be not obstructed but plainly perceived under them unless in the\ case of old people who because of their stiffness may be dressed in coarse cloth and yet not as seeming to be mere dress without body but sitting close to it so as to discover the principal parts with the end hanging loosely down not stick-\ ing out.\ flying draperies have no place among statue or bass-reliefs and though the\ latter represent histories yet such draperies are not proper in them unless on the\ second or third grounds where then they may be fixed against the ground and\ be no hindrance.\ in medal little relieved or on urns or vases where flying and running figures\ can be represented in all sorts of histories we may freely make as many of those\ draperies as we please because as we said in the third chapter the principal mo-\ tion ought always to be in profile either on single or second ground.\ willingly allow the gree\'e8s to be the inventors of loose draperies as being the\ most easy but that therfore we may not now statuary is arrived at such perfec-\ tion make use of all sorts of stuffs which is thing possible seems to me very\ strange for it is certain that all things through long practice improve and we\ daily discover and sce what was formerly unknoyn besides there are few laws\ which\ which are not capable of amendment or enlargement and though as the proverb\ says old people are seldom bettered by younger yet it happens in some things es-\ pecially in this art speak here of laws only by way of comparison pray ob-\ serve how little the famous bernini at rome has tied himself up to the greek an\'ac\ tiquities by the force of his judgment he has surpassed them he has gone\ such lengths that it was indifferent what he met with whether flying running lying standing naked or drest figures he did every thing not like the greeks\ in stone like manner but with-draperies slying ruffling and swinging as if\ they were \'e0 live people and those not twisted like guts but with beautiful and\ broad folds sometimes loose at others set thick or thin tenderly and agreeably\ worked as art requires but what am saying we need not go abroad for examples what fine draperies has not the famous statuary keyzer made it is certain he did\ not merely follow the antique thinking it below his character to beat the com-\ mon road he sought the plas ultra in order to go beyond.\ add to these the great master francisco qu\'ebnoy whom do not name as dis-\ commending others by passing them by in silence but as an excellent pattern\ for shewing us way void of error and reproof for by saying that bernini per-\ formed what the gree\'e8s never did mean that he dressed his figures in thick and\ thin stuffs in order to give them as it feeems more motion the draperies swing-\ ing flying and ruffling according to the liberty allowed to any master who\ can perform it.\ it may possibly seem to some that am trampling antique glory under foot but declare have no such intention though know that if some persons had\ the option either to be praxiteles or phidias or dutch keyzer or roman berni-\ ni they would chuse to be the last and for this reason that art has in these\ later ages met with improvements unknown to antiquity but after all must\ say in reference to the judgment have made that though it be in our choice\ ro represent any stuff we can perform yet as long as we find none more beauti-\ ful proper or fine than those which the greeks have left us for examples think\ we ought to follow them as to what is slying swinging blowing or\ ruffling which is very improper in statues as we have said shall leave that\ point to bernini and not follow either keyzer or quellin but were to do that\ honour to any person it would be to francisco qu\'ebnoy.\ but let me not by any means persuade artists to imitate the particular manner\ of this or that master for every one has the liberty of chusing for himself and preserve minc what have advanced is only whet for the judicious by mak-\ ing further enquiries.\ it is great fault in artists to fix their thoughts on single part of figure such\ as an elegant neck handsom shoulder back finely muscled or beautiful thigh which\ they work with the greatest application and pleasure in order to give it softness and if that succeed well they are perfectly charmed with it insomuch that we\ may often perceive in what part their greatest delight lay hence it frequently\ happens that the parts of the same figure are very unlike in goodness and the\ hands and feet nay sometimes the face bungled for the sake of well finished\ back it must be granted that the principal parts are of the most importance yet\ yet we are not ignorant how much the lesser can either set off or deform beau-\ tiful figure what is fine naked with poor hands and clumsy feet why was\ van dyke so famous for his portraits but for having as much regard to an hand as\ face to an expert workman it is indifferent whether he cut block of mar-\ ble or make model in clay save that the former requires more time.\ but after all this choice of handling and neatness is of no moment if the\ figure be not well set or designed because the greatest perfection lies in conjunc-\ tion of both wherefore it is certain that if phidias and praxiteles had been\ masters of bernini\'92 handling and elegance and this last the knowledge of the\ grecks all three would have deserved the greater praise.\ as readily own as take for granted that art owes its defects to artists them-\ selves as well in painting and statuary as architecture proceeding not only from\ masters keeping their pupils ignorant of their principles experiments and secrets but also from obstructing their advances in the art for though it were weak-\ ness to think the ancients did not understand it yet the decay must as imagine be principally imputed to the rcason have given from whence arose another\ mischief to wit an indifference in pupils for further improvements especially\ accordingly none will at this time seek the old path of his predeces-\ in statuary.\ fors it is now overgrown and become so uncertain as hardly to be found eve-\ ry man runs blind-fold over the heath without knowing whether.\ we observe that the gree\'e8s have commonly made more naked figures than\ the romans which can ascribe to no other cause than choice of objects -\ greeable to their inclinations and desire to display their skill in the compositi-\ on and symetry of the parts of the human body in their statues they rather\ chose to represent deities than men and in their bass-reliefs rather bacchanals\ and sacrifices than histories the romans on the other hand desirous by\ their statues and bass-reliefs to transmit the memories of their emperors to\ posterity found themselves obliged that they might not go against history to\ dress their figures in the mode of the times.\ we shall now consider the necessary observations in painting statues and bass-\ relicfs it is certain that they must be very neat and white because such works\ in stone being both hazardous troublesome and costlv were never undertaken\ before the artists had chosen fine blocks of marhle for that purpose wherefore\ we ought to take notice of the stones and their kinds.\ light marble is various one fort entirely white another bluish third flesh-\ colour being thus either in nature or changed through time they are\ all good when free from spots or eyes and appear well against proper grounds.\ for this reason we see that the ancients represented the best and most remark-\ able histories either in copper or white marble as many remains on palaces temples honorary arches columns pyramids tombs can witnefs single\ white has also this advantage above the coloured paintings that it does not soon\ change and when it fades as marble itself is not free from it it is all of colour.\ the use of it is certainly attended with much less trouble and not less natural in\ colours moreover we may sooner find ten masters for this sort of painting than\ three for colours because it is but single part of the art and remains always\ the\ the same and without alteration whereas the case of colours is quite different.\ the grey paintings represent only wall or piece of stone work but the co-\ loured ones shew the life itsels seen as through window wherefore the grey\ can neither recreate nor serve for particular pictures of delight nor can be of fur-\ ther use than in the places where they are set for ornament of which they make\ but small part and were any thing else to be placed there it would be but of\ the nature of the stone and not please like coloured picture it is even in the\ the same case with field in summer and winter the north wind deadens and\ greys it and the summer revives and makes it look green again feeding the ve-\ ry soul with its variety of flowers.\ the white marble has particular colour and tenderness as may be perceived\ in the mixture of colours wherefore it is of great moment to suit it well to its\ ground.\ between grey stone it ought only to be tempered with white and black and\ softened with light or yellow oker but between reddisn or porphiry stone with\ little vermillion or indian red somewhat upon the flesn-colour and this in\ shade as well as in the second tint if you learn this colour from the life vour\ work will have the utmost agreeableness.\ chap vi of the attitudes of statues.\ desides the draperies of statues something is to be observed touching their\ sways and postures which is apoint of the greatest consequence where-\ fore we shall in the first place shew what statues are next whether they will admit\ of any other variety than what the gree\'e8s have assigned in the third placc whether those which since their times have been in use are reckoned as good and\ lastly whether it be not more adviseable to follow the antique and good ones than to seck after new and less good.\ amidst the infinity of motions incident to nature in general it is observed that\ everv man has one particular to himself and peculiar to his temper one bustling another slow and third between both and this distinction can not but be ob-\ vious even to man of small understanding since from thence and propen\'ac\ sity for company like ourselves proceed either our love or aversion for this or that\ person or their actions and if this be granted we may be assured that the an-\ cient masters especially the greeks who was so famous for wisdom nicely ob-\ served all those motions as well the internal as external and expressed\ them in their several works wherefore it may then perhaps be inferred that no-\ thing in this particular remains for the improvements of after ages but let me\ ask why we should not as well make use of our abilities and judgments in or-\ der to go forward lthink we may in other things especially but passing by\ what is already done we shall proceed to inquire what statue means and\ signifies.\ statue represents an idol in human shape an idol say with respect to its\ origin and use and as far as statuary is concerned formed after the best propor\ tion either in gold silver or other metal and dexterously worked by the hand\ and judgment of the artist the uses of these are to be set in temples courts palaces and other public places but especially to adorn architecture we find\ them as well in scripture as fables for instance in mordecai when royally ar-\ rayed he was led on horseback by haman through the city also in christ when\ exposed by pilate to public view.\ we likewise find matter for statues in profane even recent stories as for in-\ stance in the late king william and queen maty of blessed memory moulded\ from the life and set up in the temple of honour and such like none of\ these pieces shew either active passionate or violent motions but plain or grave and majestic suitable to the dignities of the persons they represent and which\ we ought to consider as gentlemen or ladies who standing at the doors or win-\ dows to see and be seen by the people are serious and without motion whence\ the proverb seems to arise ec he stands like stone figure or block.\'92 or like dumb and lifeless person.\ we shall therefore consider two sorts of statues the unactive and the moving-\ the unactive are such as stand singly in niches and on frontispieces and the mov\'ac\ ing or bustling are those which are seen in groups of two or three on pedestals triumphal arches and fountains.\ now it is certain that these two sorts of statues must needs have particular pur-\ poses and therefore particular places for the former are seen from single stand for which they are properly made and the latter are to be viewed round about\ from all sides but of this we shall say more in the next chapter.\ as to this latter fort of statues they receive not their appellations from the\ persons they represent but from the actions they performed or the misfortunes\ they underwent an hetein lies the main point since without them the persons\ singly of themselves would not be known as in the stories of seneca petus lao-\ coon pyramus and others and these occurrences or accidents must be but once and on one occasion attributed tothem suppose any ofthese persons were to berepre-\ sented by fingle statue as laocoon with serpent pyramus with sword .\ what difference would there be between one who once committed such an act or bore such calamity and one who in his life-time had gone through thou\'ac\ sand accidents as hercules theseus achilles hector and many others who are re-\ presented by one statue wherefore we may easily conceive that the ancients\ have in every respect so firmly fixed and orderly disposed their postures that\ there is no room left either for alteration or addition besides we see that no ad-\ ditions of the modern masters are like the antique either in quality or goodness as is evident in the works of quelin keyzer bernini and many others who\ made no distinction between statues and statues.\ ifi seem here to contradict myself because having in the preceeding chapter\ set forth those three great masters almost above antiquity now place them be-\ low it let it be observed that am speaking of statues not of bass-reliefs for\ herein they have neither excelled nor been equalled to antiquity in the beauty the ancients in their statues had in view thr\'e8e principal conditions and natures\ of men the gay the heavy and the moderate the gay are active full of fire and slender like the apollo the second are melancholy slow and listless like the\ antinous and the third sort is of composed temper between both as the\ mercurius radians which recieves its light from below all these were etched by\ perrier we also commonly observe that the active and airy are seldom long\ without motion now standing on one leg then on the other accordingly the\ ancients represented such person standing on one leg resting little or nothing on\ the other foot but being to exhibit an indolent voluptuous melancholy one like\ antinous we may plainly discover how heavily he stands on one leg and yet rests\ on the other foot his belly sticking out head hanging down and hips excessive-\ ly rising the contrarities of these two figures are worthy of remark one seems\ to fly and the other to be sinking into the earth as to the expression of the\ chird figure which is mean between the two forts aforesaid he as well tem-\ pered person is made standing firm on his legs looking thoughtfully down with-\ out any turn not too fiery or easy nor too much sunk one hip swelling little\ more than that of apollo and somewhat less than that of antinous and though rest-\ ing on one leg yet appearing more firm than the one and more airy than the\ other now as the ancients knew how to divide those three different bodies so very\ nicely according to their natures and action so we need not question but they\ handled all their other figures in the same manner speak in reference to their\ qualities as still-standing bacchus mars hercules saturn even the wo-\ men goddesses and nymphs not excepted all which proceed either in great-\ er or less degree from the the three standards before mentioned this truth is evi-\ whether in models or prints let us then not imagine that we are able to invent\ new actions for our statues or others than those which are already found much\ less that they should be better and more proper but rather employ our thoughts\ more advantageoussy on other things and in the mean time implicitly follow the\ ancients in study so noble and in which they took so much pains.\ the main point lies in the beautiful sway of statue well expressed according\ to the quality condition nature and intention of it but hereby mean not that we are obliged to imitate the actions and postures of the ancients without\ the least deviation contrarily every man has the liberty of excercising his inge-\ nuity propose their works only as patterns which have always followed and\ would have others do the same without fear of being therefore called copyists or\ their works copies such moderation think even very commendable since\ the fable of lcaius teaches us that high-flyers have often great falls or by avoid-\ ing scylla they get into charybdis.\ there still remains necessary remark touching the explanatory additaments\ of statues and to be brief shall shew their natures in three particular statues and chuse out of many the stories and figures of lucretia dido and thisbe among\ the women those of the men may on the same foot be easily apprehended.\ re-\ represent these three women with daggers in their hand to denote that they\ fell by those weapons.\ lucretia is grave and majestic.\ dido haughty and proud and thisbe very plain and city-like.\ exhibit lucretia thus because she was noble roman lady who being ravish-\ ed by sextus tarquinius in discontent stabbed herself with dagger now to\ make this known round shield or board with the ravisher\'92 head thereon is\ standing or lying at her feet and on her right side lies dog to point out her\ faithful love on the pedestal appears the whole fact.\ the second queen of great spirit has likewise dagger because on being\ deceived she in spite and rage killed herself the figure of aneas place near\ her and on the other side sparrow as the emblem of wanton love.\ but thisbe in honourable affection moved or rather deceived by pyramus\'92\ imaginary death stabbed herself for pure love and despair as being unwilling to\ survive her lover near her on one side stands the figure of pyramus and on the\ other two turtles underneath these two latter appears the fact itself as in the\ first.\ these think sufficient examples for further representations as having shewed\ the difference in three which are almost conformable to each other.\ chap vii of the placing of figures upon pedestals frontispieces in\ niches and other places.\ ytis evident that statuary has dependance on architecture and is regulated\ by it and as figures adorn and give life to landscape so statuary embel-\ sishes and makes architecture look grand good landscape painter know what\ objects are most proper for an ordonnance and what forms they must have whe-\ ther crooked strait standing sitting to the left or right in order to produce\ decorum as we have shewed in the chapter touching irregular objects and fkil-\ ful architect ought to be as well acquainted with the method of setting off his\ work with figures bass-reliefs and other ornaments according to rule that it may\ thereby become not only magnificient and elegant but we may plainly perceive it must be so and not otherwise he should also know why some figures ought\ to face and others look from each other why these must swell or rise outwardly those be upright or sitting .\ upon this account the statuary ought rightly to understand the architect\'92 in-\ tention ere he proceed to work as also what figures he is to make naked or\ cloathed be they of men women or children on what side they ought to rise or\ swell and how bent and from what side seen and whether they must stand\ high or low and so forth being apprised of these particulars he is then to exe-\ .\ cute his thoughts in finding according to those sways fine actions graceful mo-\ tions and elegant draperies from whence may arise general decorum thus\ much as to these two active sisters.\ in relation to the third to wit painting which embraces them both as\ needing their aid niust say that it makes the elegancies of architecture and\ statuary whether in history or landscape its chief study so judicious painter\ ought for adorning his architecture with figures bafs reliefs to be tho-\ roughly acquainted with them that he may naturally exprefs them with shade and\ colour even so much as thereby to correct the inevitable mis-shapes still to be ob-\ served in nature.\ it is unaccountable that among so many good architects statuaries and pain-\ ters so few have understood the right placing of statues they sometimes hit it but not upon certain principles wherefore we shall endeavour to clear the point in\ few words and three sketches hoping that no offence will be taken at my adapting\ the matter also to painting since it has so near corcern therein.\ as there is nothing in nature without imperfection so in the use of things we\ ought to proceed with judgment in order to chuse the best for the satisfaction of\ our own eyes as well as those of the knowing and lovers.\ in the placing of statues in architecture the same regard must be had wherever\ they stand or sit speak not of painting alone but what generally concerns both\ the arts statuary in the first place and afterwards painting see plates lxv.\ and lxvi.\ behold the sketch in plate lxv with attention and my orderly disposition of\ the statues in different places sufficiently to evidence in the regularity of my\ scheme to any one who has mind to try the contrary.\ here you are only to observe the out-lines of couples or pairs of figures and\ their postures against each other for single figure acts for itself but pair or\ couple of figures shews the result of both.\ have formerly asserted what constitutes beautiful action namely good\ turn of the members and motion of the head arms hands and feet.\ the first example chiefly concerns statuaries who by observing that position will shew that they understand it and are able to order and make large things as\ well as small.\ the second example respects painters though it be the same as the former in\ reference to the out-line but with respect to shade when we are confined to single and fixed light we ought to chuse proper and advantageous one that the\ out-line as our principal purpose may thereby maintain its force and produce\ the effect and decorum we desire as you see here with its opposites.\ we have formerly said that the out-line without the shade is of no effect and\ that beautiful action and out-line may lose their force and the gracefulnefs be\ spoiled by an improper light which mis-shape is very visible in sharp and broad\ lights and more disagreeable than in stirring figures.\ the third example concerns those who paint figures bafs reliefs and other or-\ naments either in white red yellow or other coloured marble or stone here as in\ observe not only the out-line as in the first example or the same shaded the second but likewise the colour of the stone as well in the shade as light say especially in the shade because therein appears the greatest variety either by\ another of our positions has been that all objects retain their natural beauty in\ the shade unless they receive reflexions from ocher things likewise that white is\ the most susceptible of it and by its cleanness easily receives whatever colour it\ meets with consider also the great difference between the closeness and solidity\ of marble and the thinness and transparency of linen in the third example vou\ will find that white marble not without reason produces yellow or russet shades wherefore you ought carefully to consult nature in order to imitate her with\ knowledge.\ but to return to the first example let us observe how two opposing figures ap-\ pear in their out-line first upon the frontispiece where these two figures swell\ outwardly the faces either regarding or turning from each other and the arms\ the same and the middlemost strait without swell and fronting and those on the\ outsides also with little or no turn as being seen only forward secondly the\ two figures on each side of the steps likewise swell outwardly yet more turning\ than the others because being also seen sideways they ought to be beautiful\ from three sides thirdly the foremost figure may have as much turn and action\ as you please and be good quite round fourthly the figures in the niches are\ fronting without the least turn or stir and the greatest swell is forwards it is\ also very probable for the men to stand below and the women above because the\ woman tapers upwards and thefore is more disappearing and uniting with the air which in architecture has fine effect for this reason they formerly oftentimes\ set small pyramids on the tops of houses instead of figures.\ the uppermost figures against the sky look best naked because of their airi-\ nefs those in niches must be massy and drest and those below on the balustrade\ half drest thus much as to thefirst fketch.\ the second example shews the method to be used when it happens that the\ shade causes visible deformity on the swelling part of figure as to help it by\ the disposition of an arm bit of drapery or hand mean in painting where\ the light remains always the same and to which statuaries are not tied especially\ in the open air because the light continually alters but in painting not for as\ things are painted they stand this remark is worth noth ing as well in stirring\ as still figures.\ in the third sketch exhibit \'e0a standing figure in nich and between them bass viol supposed to be of vellowish or russet wood which colour because the\ figure is of white marble gives strong reflexions on the side we see another\ figure between the greens and third lying on the ground surrounded with the\ air in all three have one and the same intention viz to shew the cause of the\ mixture of the shades otherwise the figures will sometimes seem to be made of\ two forts of stuff as the light parts white and the shades of some other colour.\ due observation of this enables us to answer for what we do.\ although\ although now by these pofitions about the stirring actions seem to contradict\ former ones namely that in painting or carving statues we ought to give them\ but little turn yet in fact do not speak there only touching single figure whereas here are many in company and those set upon pedestals fountains and\ the like places where they are seen from all sides which creates difference as\ well in their natures as circumstances.\ ifi am taxed with presumption for taking upon me to place figures and set\ naked ones and women above and men with those which are dressed below an-\ swer that my conduct is founded on architecture which intimates that the five\ orders are peculiar to five different conditions of men as polyphemus or the giants\ for the first order mars as robust or masculous for the second apollo for his\ slendernefs for the third diana or venus as womanisn for the fourth and lris\ or cupid for the fith this consideration will think as well embolden as\ justify me to conclude this chapter ishall touch on heads hands and feet because have found both here and in other parts painters as well as statuaries very imper-\ fect in them as if of less consideration than bodies.\ some statuaries do not sufficiently vary their faces making little difference be-\ tween youth and age giving also much into the modern way of affectation and\ exaggeration mean kind of fondness in artists for particular manner as to\ make the eye-lids of their figures too large which causes an heavy look and to\ cut the dimples on each side of the mouth and the hollows of the nose and neck too deep seemingly shewing the fatness of women whereas they ought rather to\ be somewhat more expressive in the muscles since according to the turn of the\ head those rise more or less especially in thin and aged people speak only\ of giving variety to the look and breasts for faces must not be always alike\ grave and lofty there must be wanton ones as well as modest large featured as\ well as tender suitable to the bodies the case is here the same with the neck and\ breasts some are growing others full grown.\ much is to be observed about the make of the hands and set of the feet es-\ pecially when naked and without sandals but the matter lies most in ordering the\ toes the three foremost ought to be the longest and close turning out more or\ less with the tread of the feet whereas some turn them in the great one lying\ strait with the foot and the rest against it which looks very uncomely see the\ examples in plate lxvii and the difference between them of which the two up-\ permost shew the unseemliness and the three others the elegance speak of and\ though many have casts of beautiful womens hands for constant use yet these\ as has been said of faces breasts can not upon all occasions serve for the\ difference of the sexes for women have thicker and more tapering fingers and\ smaller nails than men who according to theirbuik and age have more rising\ knuckles than women.\ chap viii of the usefulness of modelling.\ having in the second chapter touched upon modelling which is prac\'ac\ tice of great concern to curious artist shall here deliver my further\ thoughts about it.\ the making models whether in clay wax or other soft matter is both use-\ ful delightful and necessary for statuary as well as painter indeed for all\ who endeavor at any perfection in the art for by this practice in reference to the\ relief of things we are to represent whereby it seems alvvays to have life itself we obtain firmness and at the same time bold handling it disburthens our\ thoughts and makes such lastings impreffions on the mind that we need not be\ at loss about the lifc we must be sensible of the great advantage arising from\ it because we can model in the aforesaid bodies bais reliefs foliage and other\ ornaments from the antiquities on all sorts of objects as altars vases difhes candlesticks cisterns and then paint them with such colour as we please also gild or bronze them according to the use we would put them to by the\ same means we may have store of elegant sword hilts and helmets greek as well as\ roman to serve any occasion in short good modeller can help himself out of\ any difsiculties therefore let me advise you to fall bodily to work and make\ bass reliefs sphinxes tombs vafes or any thing else necessary in the art you\ may likewise get small wooden dishes and pots of divers kinds turned and prettily\ adorn them with wax imagery of satyrs faces playing children dancing nymphs tliese things may be used in any manner of painting whether the picce be\ sun-shine or moon or candle-lights if you would go further you can divert\ yourself with modelling medeals in wax and oblige friend with cast of -hem-\ many of the most famous masters have practised modelling as sufficiently ap-\ pears in their works the truth is we can make any thing we want even what\ no body else has and is no where to be purchased to paint after as from the\ lise itself.\ shall say little of the method for making models because it is very common and every man has his own way wherefore shall consine myself to flat bafs\ reliefs.\ having sketched my design on paper as large or small as would model it and neatly worked it up with lights and shades board painted with the\ same colour and tint as my design and with point trace it thereon and sill these\ out-lines with wax or clay more or less raised as occasion requires then work\ the stufffirst with singers afterwards with toothed tool and lastly with wet\ pencil in order to make it smooth and even which being done and the board\ placed in the same light as our pictures are tostand or hang in it serves for mo-\ del to paint after if now we are to introduce it in our pieces whether in land-\ scape frizes shallow niches it must be set either fronting or sloping in\ such light and at such height as the point of sight directs but if it be bass\ relief relief more raised the point of sight is placed in the middle of the piece and\ though the raised parts on the extremities will then of course happen to jump over\ the out-line even sometimes over other figures according to the lengths of the\ pieces as in frize and such like to prevent that inconvenience make use\ of more thanone point of sight.\ chap ix of the visual decorum of statue with its pedestal as\ well within as without doors as also the suiting of vases and busts.\ find that the grace of the posture and sway of fine statue arises only from\ contrast in its outlines from top to bottoni affecting not only the\ figure but also the pedestal with this difference notwithstanding between na-\ ked and cloathed figures that an ornamented pedestal gives the former greater\ elegance than plain one yet this latter fort likewise produces fine effect by\ observing that the swells or scrolls of mens pedestals ought to be at bottom and\ those of women on top the course of which causes contrast both in the forms and\ sexes sce plate lxviii.\ if now it be afked in the case of placing two naked figures together viz.\ man aud woman as diana and apollo venus and adonis whether the pe-\ destals ought then to be represented so unlike my opinion is that they must\ not as being contrary to rule and order if both figures be men the pedestals\ ought to swell at bottom if both women on top and if man and woman both ought to be plain if there be woman between two men the side pedes-\ tals must be plain and the middle one particular to itself and the contrary.\ plain pedestals though bearing drest figures vases or busts suit not between\ two columns or pilasters at least they ought to hollow in not swell out.\ the height of vase placed between two figures must not exceed three fourths\ of that of the figures inclusive of the pedestal that is up to the breasts and nohigher.\ bust with its pedestal should not rise above man\'92 height the pedestal not\ swelling out but the contrary as in the examples.\ where two vases and bust are placed in garden between two figures the\ outward pedestals ought to be of the same height with-the middlemost and plain the two others must hollow in or swell out according to the course of the vases and\ be third or half lower yet retain the same breadth with the others.\ vase twice as high as broad and running up straight ought to have square swelling pedestal the contrary will produce the same decorum.\ if bust stand between two vases they must be level with the shoulders of the\ figure the contrary is also good provided the pedestal be somewhat bigger and suited to the course of the vase.\ chap of the ornaments of the frontispiece of temples houses .\ tothing can properly be done in statuary or painting without due re-\ flexion speak not only of the manner and handling but also with re-\ ficct to the circumstances of things even good building may abate of its\ lustre by bad choice in the outside ornaments wherefore w\'e9 shall shew what\ ought to be done in this point by what follows.\ the ornament on the temple of\ jupiter should be an eagle grasping thunder.\ mars some warlike instruments as armour helmet shield sword arrows and standards.\ phaebus sun in the center of the zodiac with the twelve signs.\ pallas medusa\'92 shield and an helmet adorned with standing owl or lying\ spinx.\ diana dogs bow and arrows and above them moon.\ ceres plough with ears of corn and fickle.\ bacchus -two tygers thyrsis twined with vine leaves and bunches of\ grapes.\ mercury winged cap on caduceus.\ vulcan an anvil with hammer and pincers thereon.\ vesta -an oblation bowl out of which proceeds flame in the middle of cireling serpent.\ cybele -\'97 castle or key between two lions.\ the ornaments on the house of senator consul or magistrate should be the fasces and in the middle thunder.\ learned man or philosopher spinx with burning torch and also some\ books.\ general shield with griffin represented thereon likewise club and lions\ skin.\ merchant \'97 bale of goods pair of scales and yard measure.\ phyfician \'97the figure of asculapius and staff twined with serpent.\ painter monkey with pallet and pencils.\ shepherd crook with scrip and flute hanging to it.\ fisherman -- some nets ropes rushies and fishes.\ the ornament on an\ hospital should be charity or compassion with the founder\'92 or town\'92 armis.\ prison all sorts of frightful instruments as irons chains ropes .\ house of correction -- thefigure of education holding the bridle of tamed\ beast which goes before her.\ all the arts as painting arithmetic architecture may be expressed by\ figures.\ it is certain that the design of temples built in honour of the gods was to\ place their figures in them for worship either with prayers or sacrifices where-\ fore it is great fault in ignorants to place without in frontispieces or niches what we ought to seek within those buildings as may be seen in the temple of\ diana at ephesus apollo at dolphos jupiier at dodone and many others where the\ figures all stand without them.\ th art of painting\ book xi.\ of still life.\ emblem touching still life.\ judgment and prudence sit here at table by whom are seen\ some cupids taking out of large horn of plenty all sorts of things as sceptre crown necklaces books shepherd\'92 staff mufical\ instruments garlands flowers fruit serving for still life and\ presenting them to judgment who by the help of prudence lays them in heaps\ on the table disposing them orderly for representing ingenious ordonnances in that\ part of the art.\ chap of still life in general.\ having thus far treated of the power and dignity of the noble art of paint-\ ing together with the lustre and advantage accruing to those who tho-\ roughly consider and put it in execution we shall now for the sake of weak\ capacities proceed to still life or immoveable and inanimate things such as\ flowers fruits gold silver stone musical instruments dead fish and shew\ which\ which are the best and of most advantage these may in their turns serve for ma\'ac\ terials for natural composition wherewith to please all sorts of men the great\ as well as the little the learned as ignorant wherefore out of many we shall\ fix on the following olijects as the most beautiful elegant and agreeable.\ flowers.\ .\ fruit gold silver and other rich things.\ mufical instruments.\ these four forts artfully ordered and performed may serve for the ornament\ of halls and cabinets as well as the best paintings provided they have proper\ light and hang together but we must know in the first place what constitutes good still life piece since though it be naturally handled nothing but good\ choice can charm the senses and-bring fame to the master it is weakneis to\ think that faded flowers should please much less in picture or who would\ have piece of ordinary unripe or rotten fruit in his best room and among cabinet collection seeing the life itself is so disagreeable such rubbish did for-\ merly admire but as they only shew the deformities of nature have no ap-\ petite to view them any more but to return to the subject.\ my opinion is that the beauty and goodness of still life consists only in the\ most choice objects \'92say the most choice as among flowers the most rare\ and beautiful and the same in fruits and other things these will gain the maf-\ ter credit especially with the addition of some particular significations proper to\ them it is not probable that wealthy people should be delighted with old-\ fafhiioned plate and furniture when they can have every thing more beautiful and\ elegant and as improbable that judicious lovers of music should be pleased\ with the modern lyre dulcimer or bag-pipe as for cabages carrots and tur-\ nips as likewise cod-fisn salmon herrings smelts and such like which are\ poor and mean ornaments and not worthy of any apartment he who is pleased\ with them may seek them in the markets as little approve of horse furniture\ and hunting equipage though these latter with wild boars stags hares phea-\ sants partridges and other fowls depending on princes and noblemens fancies are more tollerable.\ having- thus in general touched on still life let the judicious determine\ which sort is best and most advantageous cither to the painter or purchaser.\ as for me think eloquence very charming to the ear but goodness alone\ makes beauty aimable what is fine flower apple gold cup or well tuned\ violin without good smell delicate taste proper use and agreeable sound goodness say ought to be perfectly apparent the smell taste hearing or sound\ can not be painted but may be in some measure expressed by occult fignifications either in bass-relief by fables hieroglyphics or emblematic figures or by ma\'ac\ ny other things if the will be not wanting.\ as to the nature and property of the plices for still life they are two-fold close and open the one representing it as if hanging against wall or wainscot and the other as lving on bench or table or on the ground.\ we also suppose that no objects used in still life ought to be represented less\ than the life.\ it is likewise improper and against the nature of still life to introduce in any\ of the before-mentioned choices coloured back-works or vistos either close or\ open that is landscape architecture or any kind of living cr\'e9atures which\ would spoil the very name of still life moreover it is difficult if not im-\ possible for such painter to hit every thing and granting he can yet ques-\ tion whether he would be pleased with the title of still life painter say then that the depth of the picture is only to be represented by an hanging curtain or\ bass relief of wood or stone of such colour and tint as best suits the general\ decorum th\'e9 one darkish and the other somewhat lighter with flowers dark grey back ground suits better than white yellow or red one with fruit white and grey marble but not yellow or red yet as fine bass relief requires\ more sxill than flower or fruit and such like you may instead thereof in-\ troduce niche with god or goddess\'92 bust therein proper to the subject as flora pomona bacchus apollo diana or others according to the intent\ of your design and as you would have it bear either particular or general\ meaning which each of those sigures will supply in abundance flowers are\ various and like fruits may be divided into three sorts to wit the spring summer and autumn and having different qualities are fit for many fine and\ uncommon designs in conjunction with bafs reliefs or busts as have said with\ this caution that with slowers suit no fruit but ears of corn as being airy and\ pliable but among fruits may be some flowers especially such as alude to\ rest and mirth as poppies and rofes and yet these agree best with grapes either in garlands or festoons.\ let us now for exercise and improvement in this point observe what the\ learned say the white lilly is sacred to juno turnsol to apolbo the rose to\ venus diana and somnus claim the poppies ceres the corn-flowers juno the\ pomegranates bacchus the fig-tree and vine ceres or lsis the peaches and\ ears of corn venus and apollo the apples ops or mother earth every thing\ she produces throughout the year of instruments the lyre is dedicated to\ apollo mercury and the muses the flute to pan and venus the trumpet to\ mars .\ chap ii designs for bass reliefs proper to still life.\ tith flowers fuit zephyrus and flora or venus and adonis in\ courtship.\ with fruits ceres and pomona or pomona and vertumnus with grapes bacchus and ariadne and merry bacchanals and if there be mulberries among\ them sleeping silenus with the nymph agle is most agreeable.\ with musical instruments apollo and the nine muses orpheus playing or arion\ on the dolphin with timbrel cornet and cymbal bacchanalian sacrifice feast or dancing.\ to the three seasons as spring summer and autumn in one piece we may\ apply venus ceres and bacchus sitting together according to their ranks ex-\ clude the winter as improper and disagreeable and admitting of no other than\ poor interpretations such as hunger penury which tnis season brings\ with it.\ that these bafs reliefs may have due decorum you must observe that in gar-\ lands they ought to be octangular in festoons round and in groups or\ bunches square and parallel with the frame especially when disposed hanging\ above below and on the sides but when in corners compartment suits better and this to be square above and semi-circular at bottom and both sides thus\ much as to close bafs reliefs in general as for the relief the slatter it is th\'e8\ better and without the least ground-shade in order to prevent all mastery and\ confusion.\ touching the other sort of still life either standing or lying in deep niches or on benches or tables we have before observed that it ought not to be repre-\ sented less than the life and therefore must come quite forward in the piece as\ appearing then in its full force and quality even much better with light com-\ ing from without than within front than side light.\ there are three sorts of grounds which elegantly set off fruits grapes espe-\ cially the blue and cherries blue plumbs and all fruits inclinable to be dark require one of free-stone but apples peaches and apricots appear better on dark grey ground there is third sort as pumpkins melons oranges straw-\ berries and others which best become white ground whether they be lying on\ bench or table or in deep niche.\ shall now describe some designs which hope will not be unacceptable to the\ artist the first contains the three blooming seafons.\ table or ordonnance-\ this piece exhibits compass-headed niche square within and its depth equal\ to its diamcter therein place beautiful vase either of chrystal copper or\ gold with flowers of which set the shortest stalk in the middle and the others\ spreading on the sides above in the middle on ring hang two or three\ bunches of the largest sort of grapes to the ring fasten small ribbon on\ which loosely hang ears of corn intermixed with corn-flowers taken up and tied\ in the upper corners of the piece and hanging down the fides below round the\ vase lies sine and palatable fruit of the largest and best fort as melons lemons fresh figs pomegranates walnuts as well as apples peaches china oranges .\ this is the substance of the piece.\ the disposition is thus the festoons in bunches of an hand\'92 length are\ parted with greens and tied which greens cover the stalks of corn and being in-\ termixed as is said with some blue flowers produce an agreeable mixture with-\ out mastery the jaums setting them off are grey stone and the ribbon dark\ violet the grapes of the largest sort tied to copper ring are in the middle white and thosc hanging on each side blue with green leaf or two this group\ is\ is well set off against the shade of the hollow of the niche without drawing the\ eye froi the principal my intention is to dispose the flowers into large mafs\ of beautiful and light ones the strongest and fullest to be in the middle consist-\ ing of white yellow and light red the highest next the grapes to be turnsol and on the sides others of less force and colour intermixed here and there with\ beautiful blue one and because the vase on account of the room which the\ fruits lying about it take up can not stand quite forward the flowers spreading on\ the sides must be in snade the fruits dispose contrary again as the biggest on\ the left side and the smallest and most tender such as peaches apricots and\ plumbs on the right they should be ltalian fruits especially the lemons at least\ two fists big as being the chief of the group and governing the rest if besides\ the seasons you would represent some other meanings add lyre violin or other\ musical instrument which may be set or hung against the light side of the aforesaid\ hollow and thus the piece is complete.\ and now curious still life paintersl view this example with attention and con-\ sider whether propose to you any difficulty above your abilities ye flower\ painters is it more troublesome and artful to imitate grape apple or peach than rose lilly or turnsol and ye who practice fruit only what difficulty has\ flower more than fruits pomegranate or melon inwardly or outwardly any of\ these may be set standing or lying before you as long as you please and so may\ an harp violin lyre or slute these can store you and are all in your power and\ vour eyes can determine the proportions measures and forms of all that stands\ still hangs or lies and the soft pencil skilfully handled brings them naturally\ and properly on the cloth why then do ye so often obstinately build on single\ fort beautiful slower will certainly please the eye but more in conjunction\ with some fine musical instruments your cloth may take in some of each and\ vet ye most times do it with single sort if it be flower-piece your cloth must\ however be filled as it also must when the subject is fruits and musical instru-\ ments when we say ja man is fine still life painter we are to suppose he\ paints every thing either standing still lying or hanging.\ second ordonnance being the reverse of the former.\ the chief object in this ordonnance is low or shallow basket of fruit taking\ up in breadth the major part of the opening this basket is silled with all forts\ of tender and palatable fruit instead of the grapes over it fasten to the ring\ bunch of slowers with elegant greens tied up as in the former and against the\ jaumbs of the niche some musical instruments as slute trumpet bassoons cor-\ nets hautboys on the right side of the basket lies porcelain disn of straw-\ berries and behind it somewhat deeper in the niche wide glass of mulberries the hanging festoons on each side of the bunch of slowers consist mostly of\ ears of corn and greens the main light takes the basket of fruit consisting\ mostly of lightisn white yellow and somewhat red ones and the shaded side of\ dark black or violet the bunch of flowers over it contrarily is made up of\ blue purple violet and little white and yellow the musical instruments the\ same.\ same the other things encompaffing these as the ears of corn and greens ex-\ plain themselves.\ this piece thus disposed and artfully executed is proper matching picture\ for the preceding.\ we shall subjoin third ordonnance of music piece implying harmony no\ less elegant than the former.\ .\ third ordonnance.\ in the middle of the hollow of the niche place on desk large book of\ music opening long-ways on one side whereof is pricked the cantus and on the\ other the bafs either in church or chamber music over it on the ring ifasten\ an ivory lyre adorned with gold and between its horns hangs crown of laurel with small olive or myrtle branch all the wind-instruments before-men-\ tioned together with the violin must be disposed on the sides and behind the\ book and forwards some implements pertaining thereto viz screw or two piece of colophony box of strings bassoon or hautboy-reed all encompassed\ by beautiful festoon of flowers intermixed with ears of corn.\ this piece fuits well between the two others.\ as for the shape of all the three they will be better and look more noble if\ longer than wide.\ there remains another sort of still life which with the preceding would yield\ great variety it consists of all sorts of rich things as gold silver crystal and\ other glasses pearls precious stones and mother of pearl such pieces are com\'ac\ monly called vanitases the famous kalf has left many rare exaiples of these\ things which deserve the highest commendation.\ now to shew that in this branch the artist has plentiful materials for bringing\ him from trade to an art or in better terms for enriching the productions of\ the hand with those of the head whereby he may be reputed an artful master shall sketch fourth ordonnance taking for the subject wisdom riches and ho-\ nour solomon only prayed for wisdom and with it obtained riches and honour.\ fourth ordonnance pl\'e2ce in the middle of the piece every thing that is costly viz gold silver pots tankards salvers cups of mother of pearl crystal candlesticks heaps of\ gold and silver coin full purses on the ring above hang small board with this motto in gold letters sapienria nutrix or instead of the writing put\ in golden sun on fky-colour ground on each side of it hang some books festoon-wise intermixed with laurels naval and moral crowns garlands of palm laurel myrtle oak and fastened to the upper corners of the piece proceeding\ from the ring and hanging down the sides about them might be twined small\ streamer with these words laboris merces sapientia nutrix or pr\'e6mia majora\ iaboribus.\ now to bring wifdom which fs the principal part of the piece into the mid\'ac\ dle we may in lieu of the sun and books hang above on the ring the golden\ ffeece and exhibit below \'e0 sphinx with some books and peach\'e8s.\ there are other sorts of still life as dead fisni cabbages carrots aamnips .\ which being too low and poor and bearing no particular lignifications think\ unworthy to range with those before-mentioned how well soever they be exe-\ cuted much less to adorn the cabinets of great and wise men but dead hares partridges pheasants and all sorts of hunting equipage may as have sald be\ praise-worthy.\ chap iii representations of still life applioable to particular\ persons.\ although have before said that the famous kaff excelled in still\ life yet he could give as little reason for what he did as others before and\ fince he only exhibited what occurred to his thoughts- as porcelain pot or\ diss gold cup mum-glass rummer of wine with lemon-peel hanging on it clock horn of mother of pearl gold\'92or silver footed silver dish of peaches or else\ cut china oranges or lemons carpet and other ufual things without any\ thought of doing something of importance which might carry some particulai\ meaning or be applicable to something neverthelefs to shew that this may be\ done as well in still life as in other representations fhall give the following\ sketches made applicable to particular persons.\ table or ordonnance adapted to triumphing warrier herein we exhibit some arms viz steel breast-piece an helmet elegantly\ wrought shield and sword with the hilt representing an eagle or lion\'92 head pike or spear bent bow and quiver of arrows also iome crowns of laurel palm and olive above on the frame may be fastened on two rings gold chain to\ which hangs an heart beset with precious stones coming down to the breastapiece and over it may be the motto of the hero to whom we apply the subject we\ exhibit further gold crown bracelets and rings an hat with feathers and dia-\ mond button and trumpet under these fies an embroidered coat on the table with sleeve hanging down from it on the wall or in small table may be\ seen in bafs relief apollo having killed the dragon python or perseus and andro-\ meda or man in lion\'92 sxin tearing open tiger\'92 mouth and near him club.\ comment on the aforesaid objects.\ the breaft-piece was anciently taken for mark of understanding and defence for as it guards the breast it preserves life.\ the helmet denotes an inclination for war and martial spirit.\ the shield also token of defence was so much regarded by the ancients that\ they made prefent of it to conquerors in consideration of their valour and con-\ duct virgil in his ninth book mentions aneas\'92 ordering fhield to be prought\ to him wherewith to reward the fidelity and valour of nijus the argives had\ eustom of marching young men who had by notable exploits merited the hongur\ with the shield of enhippus carried before them triumphantly through their towi\ and territories we also read that the palladium which the ancients believed\ fell from heaven was shield mysteriously representing the protection of the\ roman people and empire and according to numa pampilius\'92 explanation the\ shield implied success and prosperity whereby he endeavoured to buoy and com-\ fort the roman people on their being sorely visited in his eighth year with pesti-\ lence which threatened the destruction of all staly the shields were moreover de-\ dicated to those who had saved the town and common-wealth from any great and\ imminent danger and to perpetuate such benefaction and as spur to virtue they caused the story to be engraved or carved on their shields the shield and\ pike also signify war chiefly in retrieving the damages sustained by the enemy and in putting them to flight and destroying them yet weapons are of little\ advantage if not used with wisdom and understanding wherefore we generally\ see pallas represented with shield and pike the latter signifying force and quick-\ ness of apprehension.\ the pike or-spear also denotes the spreading of glorious name for which\ reason according to plutarch lysippus adorned the statue of alexander with it tho\ others represented him with thunder in his hand intending thereby to immor-\ talize the atchievements of that hero the pike or arrow also being thrown or\ shot at mark hieroglyphically signifies the spreading of glorious name yet according to the ancients the pike or spear not only implied royal grandeur and\ authority but was likewise the usual reward for those who had shewed their bra-\ very in conquering the-enemy as pliny says that sicinnius dentatus for his ad-\ mirable walour was presented with twelve pikes festus pompeius-thinks that ge-\ n\'e8rals received the pike or javelin in token of their being intrusted with the prin-\ cipal management of the war and empire and that therefore it was customary to\ tsell the prisoners publicly sub hasta or under the pike or spear.\ the sword in reference to war signifies fury cruelty fright persecution and\ threatening with death.\ the bent bow is likewise sign of war and ithe arrows signify the people or\ the enlargement of power also velocity and quick motions.\ the crown-of laurel was the token of conquerors and those who performed any\ glerious-act -as the-ancient remains sufficiently inform us and we learn from\ history that the roman generals and commanders used in their triumphs to\ present crown of laurel to jupiter capitolinus.\ the ancient romans also used to bestow palm on those who triumphed as general token of victory and the palm-tree though pressed by \'e0 heavy weight will yet grow against it wherefore in hot battles it is esteemed token of vic-\ tory which can only be got by firm resolution to refist and despise dangers and\ adversities.\ the olive is likewise mark of victory the ancients adorning their trophies\ and warlike monuments with its branches or decking the head of the conqueror\ with crown of its leaves.\ the gold chain was the roman reward for valour and virtue it not only re-\ compensing merit but serving for badge of honour glory and esteem the\ roman history informs us that the son of tarquinius priscus though but fourteen\ years of age charged the enemies in the open field and conquered them where-\ fore to imortalize his valour he was the first who was honoured with gold chain though according to others hersilius the first born of the ravished sabines at rome first received that honour we also read that ricinnius dentatus was sixty-three\ times rewarded with \'e0 gold chain and twenty-five times with other gold or gilt\ presents.\ the heart beset with- precious stones hanging down to the breast on gold\ chain signifies that wholesome advice and deliberation spring from the innermost\ of the heart wherefore those who triumphed were introduced with this gold\ chain about their necks in the utmost part whereof or the heart hanging down\ to the breast they imagined were contained herbs and balm which secured the\ triumphers from malice and envy asconius particularly remarks that the chil-\ dren of the nobles or free citizens wore those chains but the liberti or freed-anen for distinction\'92 sake had them only of silver and copper to which juvenal in his\ satyrs alludes saying the poor must be content with copper.\ the gold crown and bracelets which adorned both the shoulders and arms were likewise the rewards of great actions these gifts were preserved for poste-\ rity as spur for young people indefatigably to tread in the steps of their fore-fa-\ thers titus livius in his tenth book says that after the victory obtained over\ the samnites near aquilonia papirius on that occasion presented sp nautius his ne-\ phew spurius papirius four captains and troop of pikemen with bracelets and\ gold crowns giving the other captains foot-soldiers and horsemen bracelets\ and ornaments of silver which they called crnicula or little horns and decius the tribune received gold crown from aulas cornelius cossus for defending certain strong place belonging to the romans against the samnites and forcing\ them to raise the siege.\ the romans also esteemed the rings as badges of honour and nobility for ac-\ cording to titus livius in his third book treating of the second punic war on\ mago\'92 being dispatched by hannibal to notify to the carthagenians the bloody de-\ feat of the romans in the battle of canna he poured out before them an heap of\ gold rings taken as booty from the slain adding to extol the victory that\ among the romans none but the great and noble were allowed to wear them and\ towards\ towards the close of his ninth book he relates that on flavius\'92 being in pub\ lic asfembly chosen adilis or superintendant of the public buildings the no-\ bility were so distinguisned that several of them laid down their gold rings and\ other tokens ofhonour and esteem and the eloquent ccero in his fourth ora-\ tion against verres reproaches him for bestowing in public asfembly of the\ people the tokens of honour gold rings on mean and unworthy people with\ whom agrees asconius saying that the fasces civic crown and gold rings were\ by the people looked on as badges of liberty and nobility and always attended\ with honour and profitable incomes.\ the greeks reputed the hat or cap as token of noble extraction wherefore\ they represented the head of ubsses covered with hat or cap as being noble both\ by father and mother for this reason we commonly see on ancient coins and\ medals an hat or cap circumscribed libertas.\ the diamond is indisputably the hardest and for its sparkling the most beau-\ tiful and perfect of all precious stones and which is most surprising and remark-\ able it resists the consuming fire without losing any of its virtue or excellence.\ wherefore it is used as an hieroglyphic of immoveable firmness in prosperity\ and adversity accordingly the ancients also attributed to it supernatural qua-\ lity of freeing the heart from vain fear and despair and that it never left man\ either in his pressures or dangers when principally he ought to be master of\ himself.\ the plume of feathers also signifies honour and nobility and the trumpet esteem and an immortal name.\ the embroidered coat called tunica palmata was an under garment commonly\ worn by those who triumphed acording to titus livius in his tenth book and\ isidorus hispalensis in his originum lib says that those who had conquer-\ ed used to receive gown called toga palmata or toga picta from the victo-\ ries and palm branches worked in it and macrobius lib saturnal cap.\ affirms that tullus hostilius first introduced this garment among the romans.\ the twofirst bass-reliefs explain themselves and by the third we mean strength for the lion\'92 skin implies high understanding and resolution of mind and the club conduct and intrepidity.\ second ordonnance relating to judge.\ in this we reprefent pair of scales sword looking-glass septre topped\ with an eye board with triangle thereon inclosing the number and the\ image of truth an hazel wand and fasces scythe rod ax gold chain staff twined\ with ivy large folio book whereto is affixed the coat of arms of the common-\ wealth and on the wall fruitful palm-tree in bass-relief.\ explanation of these objects.\ the fcales commonly placed in the hand of justice signify that weighing all\ mens\ mens actions sne affigns\'92to every one what god has decreed him wherefore the\ heathens also represented astr\'e6a ascended to heaven and seated there between the\ lion and scales intimating thereby that judge ought resolutely to punish trans-\ greffions according to their merit without respecting persons.\ the sword likewise signifies justice and the severity of the law according to\ the apostle ruler is the minister of god and bears not the sword in vain to\ execute wrath on him that doth evil looking-glass in the hand of prudenoe denotes reforming of manners.\ the ancient agyprians by the hieroglyphic figure of the sceptre with an open\ ye fignified the absolute authority of equity and prudence which always watch-\ ing and penetrating mens actions justly reward each according to his deserts.\ platarch in his doctrine of the phythagoreans intimates that the triangle is the\ most perfect figure of justice some palce the number within it because we\ therein see the godly character of the almighty.\ the image of truth explains itself.\ the hazel wand fignifies ecclesiastical and the fasces secular dignity or re-\ ligion and policy.\ the fcythe is is'the hieroglyphic of chastisement as we read in the prophet\ zechariah that the scythe he saw in vision was going forth tocut off all thofe\ who stole or swore.\ the rod also implies punishment for the support of good discipline and laws\ according to equity and justice.\ the romans and some of the greeks took the ax hieroglyphically for heavy\ chastisement we see in the medals and coins of tenedos mentioned by pollux for the king of tenedos having published law that any person caught in adul-\ tery should be put\'92to death with the ax and in compliance therewith not spared\ his own son he commanded this story to be struck on the coins and medals in\ order to be thereby immortalized.\ the agyptians likewise applied the bulla or gold chain and heart to their\ judges intimating that making pure truth their only aim they ought to be\ impartial and give judgment without respect of persons.\ the staff twined with ivy signifies that justice ought to be protected- for by\ the staff is understood authority and by the ivy protection which should always\ flourish.\ the large folio book contains the statues and ordinances of the country.\ the fruit of the palm-tree represented in bass-relief being of equal\'92size with the\ jeaves the ancients would thereby signify justice and equity this tree also con\'ac\ sisting of lasting matter and not altering or decaying so soon as-others serves for\ pattern of the- maintenance of justice without impediment or alteration and as\ it never drops its leaves as others do and refists alla pressure and weight thereby\ is implied that judges ought not to be biassed but withstand those who endea-\ vour to draw them from their-duty by fair words gifts or intrigues.\ ordornance relating to lawyer.\ in this table we exhibit plaister figure of mercury winged at head and feet standing on square stone pedestal having in one hand his golden caduceus twined\ with serpents and in the other an olive branch by him is plaister sphinx.\ also sword and fhield lyre or harp burning lamp an ink-horn with pens\ and roll of paper sieve some of the principal law books and abible in small vase or pot may be set an iris or two above on ring hang three garlands one composed of laurel and ivy another of cedar and myrtle and the third of\ oak leaves on the wall or in small table we see in bass-relief the fable of\ minerva brought forth out of jupiter\'92 brain.\ explanation of the objects.\ mercury implies the impreffion of words upon the mind and the force of elo-\ quence wherefore the ancients believed he was the messenger and the interpre-\ ter of the gods.\ the square stone whereon he ftands fignifies the regard for and stability of the\ laws and rules whereby to direct our speeches for which reason mercury is stiled\ tetragonus or square that is firm and certain.\ his staff or caduceus intimates that obstinate tyrants must yield to the laws and\ huent charms of eloquence by the serpents twined about the golden rod the\ ancients mean that eloquence tempered with ingenuity and prudence can easily\ bring men\'92to reason some also would have the golden rod in the hand of mer-\ cury to\'92signify the excellence and eminence of honourable offices due to those who\ employ their eloquence the gift of heaven in their neighbours welfare and the\ common good.\ by the olive branch in mercury\'92 hand is understood peace for the ancients be-\ lieved it composed \'92the differences of contending parties.\ his wings at head and feet were affigned him to signify the readinefs and force\ of eloquence.\ the sphinx shews that nothing is so abstruse or occult that lawyer\'92 penetra-\ 'ting judgment can not clear.\ we compare jurisprudence to\'92the sword and thield for as warrior thereby\ defends himself and annoys his enemy so council gets his cause by dint of\ cstrong arguments and well grounded conclusions.\ the ancient romans signified by the lyre or harp \'e0 man of great learning\ and judgment for that instrument is composed of divers strings and sounds pro-\ ducing fine harmony like the lawyer when he reconciles the difference of things\ to r\'e9ason in order to make contesting parties agree by the harp or lyre we al-\ so understand that harmony arises from different and dissonant cords and that\ people of contrary sentiments meeting together may by good union settle and\ transmit to posterity an excellent form of government and as plato in his\ timaeus stiles the soul concert or sweet harmony so concord may be justly\ called\ called the soul of the state the gree\'e8s and romans say the lyre was partly in-\ vented by mercury and partly by others.\ the shape of the ancient lyre is this it was bent like two horns joined to-\ gether having swelling belly-and on top- handle it is said to have had but\ three strings and these could produce seven tunes making perfect harmony.\ the three strings were assigned in imitation of the three seasons of the year known\ to the aguptians viz summer winter and spring each consisting of four months and they attributed the cantus to the summer the bass to the winter and the tre-\ to the spring others say that this application respects man whose body con-\ sisting of four elements and the soul in reference to its acts ofthree thus makes\ wherefore the\ darkness flies the light of true knowledge and understanding.\ lamp is sometimes taken for the works done by its light for as the night through\ its stilness is very proper for study so the greck poets also gave the night name\ which signified the producing understanding wisdom and gladness as the mind\ is then apt for meditation accordingly the old proverb of the students is plas\ olei quam vini he spent more in oil than wine meaning more time in dili\'ac\ gent labour of the mind to attain sciences than in taking walks feasting or other\ diversions epicharmus used to say that he who would study great things must\ not for the sake of ease spare the nights.\ the agyptians understood by the ink-horn pens and roll of paper all things\ whereby arts and sciences might be represented.\ by the sieve the same people hieroglyphically meant the fruitfulness of in-\ struction in arts and sciences also the writers of sacred and mysterious things foras the sieve separates the good from the bad so their lawyers who were also\ stiled priests knew how through their prudence and wisdom to distinguisn be-\ tween things concerning life and death accordingly they made use of the word\ sieve for expressing what is true and known others sav that by that implement\ is signisied man of great knowledge and perfection who can discourse of things\ divine and human with equal penetration moreover as the sieve separates the\ slour from the bran so experience fits us for discerning between good or bad right or wrong wherefore virgil in the first book of his georgics rightly\ stiles it mystica vannus lacchi the mystic fan or sieve of lacchus some apply\ to this point the saying of the philosopher antisthenes that it were great folly not\ toknow how to distinguisn the corn from the chaff meaning the learned and be-\ neficial citizens from illiterate.\ next to the bible the chief authors for law are viz among the greeks solon lycurgus demosthenes and isocrates among the romans cato cicero hortenfius and caesar their leges and orationes also the corpus byzantinum and corpus\ juris or justinianeum compiled by theophilus and doretheus senators under the\ emperor justinian from feries of ancient law books among the spaniards di-\ dacus coverruvius francisco de salgado secretary to phillip ii and ferdinandes vas-\ quius among che french jacobus cujacius and marcus antonius muretus among\ the germans fritchius and carpzovius and among the duich hugo grotius groenewegan .\ the herb or flower lris is an emblem of eloquence according to haner who to.\ describe that of the tnojan embassadors represents them as having eaten the bloomr\ ing lris meaning their beingthoroughly szilled in pleasing eloquence for that.\ flower by its variety of colours is not unlike the heavenly tris or rainbow whor the ancients accounted the goddess of eloquence.\ the garland or laurel intermixed with ivy leaves signifiesthat lawyers are for\ their excellent labours and parts.to be had in perpetual remembrance for by the laurel the ancients understood natural force and fruitfulness of understanding and by the iyy which though at first creeping along the ground at last taps the\ highest trees and buildings the fkilkor experience which lawyers obtain by con-\ tinual labour and practice.\ it will not be disagreeable to that body of men that for imortalizing\ their names and memories we add the garland of cedar and myrtle to the laurel\ and ivy fince touchang great and eloquent men we may very well conclude\ with persius and horace cedro digna locuti they have spoken things worthy to\ be cut in cedar or to be everlasting for the cedar is among the trees the amblem.\ of eternity as never rotting or mouldering through age wherfore the ark of the\ covenant was also made of it the myrtle signifies mind enriched wich many-\ endowments.\ among tkeiarowns with which the romans used to adorn the heads of legifla-\ tors and pleaders that of oak-leayes was in great esteem ag implyang the con-\ servation of the town andicitizens several reasons are assigned for this soft of\ crouns some say than originally the arcadiaus were first-honoured with it fon\ the antiquity of their oracles others think it proceeded from that tree being sa-\ cred to jupiter the patron of the dodonaan oracle and protector of towns and\ that therefore it was very reasonable to crown those who had saved citizen either\ by arms or law with the leaves of that tree dedicated to the tutelar god of all\ towna others are of opinion that the oak was the first made of all trees and\ has been the first nourisher of mankind and material for the oracles we see tq\ this day acertain medal with this darick inscription eheiprtan representing\ an eagle treading on thunder and two oak branches bent garland-ways which\ was doubtless the coin of epirus alluding to the oak of chaonia and the dodoncan\ oracle.\ by minerua broceeding from jupiter\'92 brain we represent the nature and acti-\ vity of understanding and wisdom for gaining jurisprudence she likewise implies\ mature and wary deliberation wherefore some hold that jupiter knew metis or counsel and prudence and then brought forth minerva for wisdom and un-\ dersfanding are only attainable by mature deliberation-and advice.\ table or ordonnance relating to divine we exhiiht herein abible or scripture small altar buraing lamp breast-\ plate sword two arrows drum or timbrel table bell harp cistern and cen-\ ser fieve measure of corn basket of laread and \'e0 lump of leaven \'e0 salt-sellerwith\ salt salt white linen girdie bundle of flax waggon-wheel saphire ring olive\ branch sheet of paper whereon are three conjoined circles inclosed within fourth and under them an equilateral triangle and square in small picture is seen landscape exhibiting among other things rock palm cedar-tree and an hill\ sending forth abundance of water on the wall in bass-relief is an elephant rear-\ inghis trunk towards heaven as also stork and cock but above all we must\ not forget the fruitful mustard-seed sprig whereof we have set in pot or vase\ on the table with the other objects an explanation whereof follows.\ adamantius and others tells us that the powers of the universe must yeid to the\ dictates of religion further explanation of the bible is unecessary since it is\ sufficiently known to every body.\ the altar is accounted the hieroglyphic of piety of whichl have treated in\ book ix page compares the lamp to the body the habitation of the soul and its\ fhiining light to the faculty of understanding but in scripture we often find that by the lamp are meant the doctors and teachers of arts sciences and mysteries who should be set on the candlestick in order to expel darkness and light those in\ the house in another passage it is said that the light ought not to be hidden and if the light according to scholasticus in his climax come to be in dark-\ jnefs what will not the darkneis of nature or men ignorant of god be guilty of some again understand by thelight the gospel others st. joln tle baptist who is also\ alled burning lamp the prophets were also lamps but burning dim as speaking\ mysteriously but st. john as with finger has pointed out our- saviout eucherius\ observes that by the lamp is sometimes meant good works and therefore the gos-\ pel says ee let your light so shine before men that they may see your good\ works the light or fire sometimes likewise hieroglyphically signifies devo\'ac\ tion and piety if earthly things can in any ways unite us with the heavenly no-\ thing in nature has greater affinity with the mind and spirit than fire because it\ lights and clears every thing and makes us intimate with heaven.\ the philosopher antisthenes speaking of the breast-plate commonly said ie that virtue was constant defence because it could never be lost for the arms\ of wisdom and understanding are lasting to those who are rightly arrayed with\ them.\ in which sense st. paul exhorts his congregation ee to put on the ar-\ mour of faith for quenching the fiery darts of the wicked agreeable to horace -quipectus pr\'e6ceptis format amicis.\ the apostle st. paul fays ce that the word of god is quick and powerful and\ sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing afunder of\ soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow intimating that though the\ stone in the kidneys seem incurable yet the word of god can convert and cure the\ hard stone of our unbelief for by our saviour\'92 coming on earth we have learnt\ what the flesn and spirit incline to and his doctrine has like two-edged\ sword divided the spirit from the flesh that we might afterwards lead spiritual\ life\ life as being not in the flesh but in the spirit esteeming the corruption of the\ flesn great gain when through the spirit we obtain eternal life.\ encherias thinks that the words in psalm cxxvii as arrows are in the hand of\ mighty man so are the children of the youth allude to the appostles and their\ misfion into all countries because in their travels they pierced mens hearts with\ the doctrine of christ as with darting arrow and brought them from darkness to\ light for by the arrows in several places of scripture is understood god\'92 word\ penetrating the soul as with two-edged sword.\ we find in sacred writ that the almighty is to be praised with drums or tim-\ brels and gregory in the sixth book of his epistles to athanasius emblemati\'ac\ cally shews by the drum kind remembrance for says he ce as the materials of\ that instrument are long before prepared to fit it for sound so man should\ piously endeavour to thank his creator and loudly praise him for his benefits. the bells hanging according to moses\'92 command at the hem of the high-priest\'92\ garment emblematically signified the publishing of god\'92 will and his being\ heard by their tingling on entering into or coming forth of the holy of holies intimates that the ministry should always have the word and laws of god in their\ mouths for rebuking exhorting or comforting according to the weakness and\ transgressions of men.\ the harp formerly represented all kinds of arts and virtues and eusebius thinks\ it takes its name from greck word signifying as much as to instruct in excellent\ sciences and thus the songs of orpneus and proclus among the heathens and\ david among the jews have powerfully incited to good living.\ by water and fire or the cistern and censer the agyptian priests understood purgation from spots and filth even from the darknefs of ignorance by means of\ pure doctrine accordingly after funerals the ancients purified themselves with\ water and smoaking perfumes the latter hieroglyphically representing prayers\ and divine doctrine as hesychius bishop of jerusalem writes.\ the same people meant by the sieve the fruitfulnefs of instruction in arts and\ sciences others the end of all things as by often examining ourselves to learn\ quietness of life and by due reflexion on what is past present and to come to\ make prosperity and adversity equal.\ doctrine and instruction those people called sbo which being interpreted sig-\ nifies plenty or all that is necessary for life as if the study of sciences required\ good fortune aristotle says ecthe rich should study philosophy and zecha-\ riah noted man among the jews et lf you have slour you will learn the law the lawv implying\ if you have knowledge in the law you will want no flour knowledge and sciences and the slour every thing necessary for sustenance but\ ithink according to agyptian wisdom that this doctrine rather respects the soul\ than the body for it is believed that the basket of unleavened bread which\ aaron and his sons only were to offer hieroglyphically signified the tongue or\ word or eternal and heavenly eloquence for as bread supports the body so the\ word of god nourishes to eternal life and because bread by general consent implies doctrine and instruction to whom must we return our thanks but tohimn\ who by his doctrine has enlightened our understanding and is the fountain of\ plenty and perfection in this sense ithie bread \'e9alled the loavens or twbetenths of\ fine flour offered as in liviticus xxiii for \'92 meat offering signified che law and\ the gospel but according to our saviour when under temptation that ie man did not live by \'92bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the\ mouth of god.\ in baking the leaven has in seripture divers \'92significations among others it\ implies human scienc\'e9s now sciences are divided into human and divine the\ former subject to the diversity of words but the latter constant and everlasting for what is once truly perfect always remains so and the fire which once warms\ will always warm as long as it is fire eternal providence and government of all\ created beings are endiess and thus nature philosophy ethics and theology are\ very conformable to the deity but grammar rhetoric and dialeftita ar\'e9 called hu-\ man sciences wherefore says origines ee the leaven is not used in offerings for\ divines understand by it human sciences the matter and foree whereof fies onfy in\ words which nevertheless are aids because the purity of speech whichtgrammar\ teaches thews the beauty and excellence of eloquence obtained by rhetoric and\ the method of reasoning and opposition gained by dialectica is an help to many\ other scienc\'e8s philosophers say that the products of the earth are owing to falt divin\'e9s\ compare it to the gospel alledging leviticus chap ee with all thine offerings\ thou shalt offer salt or in all your doctrines you must be governed by those of\ the apostles who according to our saviour are the salt of the earth the frank-\ incense put on the twelve cakes according to the jezissit rite the seventy interpre-\ ters have rendered salt to signify the apostolical doctrine for as falt makes meat\ palatable so according to hesychius instruction ald exhortation cause in us smell and taste of divine wisdom whereby our good works \'e0s faith hope and\ charity produce fruit acceptable to god.\ the jewissi priests were commanded to set the people pattern of chastity piety\ and good behaviour and to be always ready to walk in god\'92 paths as appears by\ the white linen girdle signifying the most sacred and mysterious doctrine by which\ they ought to govern themselves and their congregations jerimiah\'92 girdle had\ the same meaning as gril largely shews as the girdle was white linen we are\ led to consider the first matter it was made of to wit flax.\ the seed of flax comes up as green as grass in fhort time after sowing and\ having blossomed and set its seed it is then pulled and rotted in water and after-\ wards laid to dry in the sun and then being beaten to softness it is combed\ and hatchelled and spun into thread after boiling in strong lye it is made into\ web of linen and whitened for dress to appear in before god the care ne-\ necessary about this herb which is an emblem of undefiled life ought continually\ to be had in view that laying afide things vain and unprofitable we may by\ means of science render ourselves irreproveable and through adverfity and temp-\ tations obtain the white garment of glory the quick and easy growth of flax shews how easily virtues and sciences are attainable if we set readily about them.\ hesychius understands by the flax the frail efforts of mortals and the thread of the\ almighty\'92 will always remaining with us wherefore it is the duty of the mini-\ stry\ stry by stheir constent labours to given out the pax swhereof ten prepare \'92 garment\ rf good works.\ many among the learned\'92emblematically fignify by the waggont wheel divi-\ hity because the whe\'ebfnever touching the ground but in one point so the soul\ lought to be elevated towards god thus divines are rightly compared to wheel fhat by forsaking earthly thoughts their conversation should always be in heaven.\ the sapphire was always in great esteem as emblematically representing sove-\ reignty and priesthood some say that this storie draws heavenly influences from\ jupiter and saturn and that those who wear it obtain all their desires as from\ jupiter dominlon and authority and from saturn the priesthood but according\ to the fathers this\'92ftone represents the throne spoken of by ezekiel to wit the s\'e9at\ \'92af god erernal good and almighty and eacherius understands by the make of\ the hedvens \'92the soci\'e9ty of the pious and elect wherefore says hesychius the-\ throne of sapphiresignifies\'92the tenth or empireal heaven for by the colour he un-\ derstands purity clearnefs and heavenly light always instructing the church in un-\ alt\'e9rable and pure doctrines.\ we learn from scribture that the olive-tree was originally th\'e9 emblem of\ -peace for no sooner did the waters abate but the dove which noah fent soon\ after returnetl with an ofive-leaf as token that the wrath of heaven being ap-\ peased god took compafsion on\'92the remains of human race and other creatures\ iin 'the ark and therefore caused the waters to r\'eatire into the bowels of the earth.\ the olive-branch is also in scripture the emblem of \'92 pious man as we see in\ the gospel that the light ought\'92to burn pure on the candlestiek whereby our\ saviour intimates that both preachers and hearers should sill their jamps with the\ coil of christian virtues the sam\'e9 tr\'e9e \'92for its continual verdure is also taken for\ ithe efblem of hope accordingly basilius wishied we might be like it because\ abounding with blossoms and fhining\'92greennefs it always affords hope of what is\ \'92to come or \'92the durable fruits of piety and mercy.\ the wisest agyptians and grecks did when mens understandings were fimple\ tand void of sophistry very properly calf the chain of certain sciences eneyclopa dia \'92as being by three circles so linked together that the center of the one is the be-\ ginning of the other and those inscribed within larger called theology for the\ inner circles signify human scienc\'e9s which getting root by means of custom rea-\ son and nature are perversely taken for infallible but the circle inscribing them denotes divine sciences we understand the same things emblematically of the\ dress and ofnaments of the high-priest\'92among the jezs for his girdle implied ir-\ reproveabl\'e9 manuers his priestly garb truth sound doctrine and discourses which\ with their explanations let men into the knowledge of things or philosophy and\ his glitt\'e9ring robe signified pure divinity having no other tendency but correc-\ ction of manners and leading to virtue and heaven scripture teaches that ee the\ spirit of wisdom enters not into the heart of the wicked \'92 accordingly moses de-\ nied the unclean and sinful entrance into the tabernacle thereby intimating that\ those who improve in virtue and the knowledge of god ought by the use of the five\ loaves according to grid or the five tart books of the law to prepare their hearts for\ the two fishies or the doctrine of the evangelists and apostles and therein to pre-\ serve.\ ferve next to the science for the improvement of manners divines should en-\ which the learned\ deavour at distinctness plainness and order in their speeches call dialectica whose province is to determine controversies and resolve doubts by\ reasoning justly for although like moses they practised moral duties and were\ received into the sanctuary yet they touched not on sacred things otherwise than\ by means of their speeches after this they enquired into natural philosophy or\ physics having for the subject the universe and all created beings this science\ cleared their doubts and scruples and prepared them for contemplating the glori-\ ous building of the heavens in order to thank their creator for the knowledge\ received their last study was theology which as we have said comprehends all\ sciences this gives divines such constant peace as neither the regularity of hu-\ man deportment purest eloquence or the most exact enquiries into nature could\ afford them but this unchangeable peace and firm alliance with god they ob-\ tain by submitting their knowledge inclinations and carnal affections to the rules\ prescribed by reason this mutual friendship which the pythagoreans esteemed the\ main point in philosophy leads us into the most secret part of the sanctuary in or-\ der to view the glory of god till at last arriving at the highest degree of know-\ ledge we courageously defeat ofiris or the enemy of our souls.\ though the aforesaid instruction consists of four parts yet solomon the wisest of\ men divides it into three sciences to wit ethics physics and metaphysics which\ he has handled in his proverbs ecclefiastes and song or canticum canticoaum teaching in the proverbs moral obligations in ecclefiastes the nature of things and in his song the contemplation of things supernatural this seems well to\ agree with the mention in scripture of the god of abraham lsaac and jacob for\ abraham\'92 obeying god in all things shews an example of moral duties lsaac\'92\ digging wells and searching the depths of the earth signifies physics or natural\ philosophy and jacob\'92 dream of the ladder and the ascent and descent of the\ angels thereon the contemplation of divine things both the hebrez greck and\ latin divines have largely handled this subject even the elements seem to in-\ culcate this doctrine for the earth water and air by their wonderful conjunction represent the different degrees of the sciences the earth and moisture implying\ the history of things as teacher of moral duties the waters disturbed by the\ winds shew the turmoils happening in human actions which ethics serve to allay the air admonisnes that at length raising the whole force of our thoughts up-\ wards we ought continually to contemplate the divine nature called by the grecks theologia which is the top and limit of our understanding we say nothing here\ of dialecticu because it is subservient to ethics physics and theology in order t of those three sciences.\ by the equilateral triangle we signify the aim and purpose of an holy and inno-\ cent life because to make it both edifying and happy three duties are necessary to wit to give our neighbour wholesome advice to judge justly and to do well wherefore pallas was by the heathens called tritonia as naving the care of impar-\ tial justice the agyptians and greeks who were chiefly famous for emblematic\ learning judicioussy understood by the triangle the assiduity of human understand-\ ing in searching into things heavenly earthly and subterranean others would\ signify\ fignify by it mathematics phyfics and metaphyfics with which the opinion of\ socrates well agrees.\ the square-implies constancy and immoveableness because however turned it alway shews four lines and as many angles these though mathematical obser-\ vations are very applicable to those who love piety and other christian virtues since\ they remain constantly with them and embalm their memories to posterity ari-\ stotle in his first book of moral duties and third book to theodat is of the same\ opinion believing that man by comparison may be called square or perfect and\ pious this quadrates with the latin proverb quadragonum in se perfectum criminis expers the square is perfect and not liable to censure ancient di-\ vines teach that noal\'92 ark which god commanded to be built square signified\ the excellent pastors of the church by whose instruction notwithstanding any\ snares or heresies men were led to eternal happiness for adamantius exhorts to\ build square libraries n\'f4t of stone or wood but of the books of the prophets apo-\ stles and teachers out of which may be abundantly

because they are thickest downwards and run tapering up-\ wards and with more pointed branches and these may be compared to worldlings who slighting the best things seek theit satisfaction only in the frail and momentary these men spare no labour or trouble in heaping riches will even purchase tem-\ poral honours at the hazard of their lives but stop at once when they are to be-\ stow an hour\'92 service on their creator or to fuccour distressed neighbour whereas the pious may be rightly compared to the palm-tree which by its tender\ stem despising earthly pleasures exalts its virtue on high that it may adhere to\ and obey the will of the creator wherefore it is said that the righteous shall grow\ and blossom as the palm-tree the cedar-tree as yielding excellent and useful fruit is the emblem of mercy\ and piety two virtues best becoming the pillars of the ehurch who are ee conti-\ nually to watch over the lost sheep of the house of lsrael \'92 and to practise works of\ mercy on

and\ piety for as soon as the new moon enlightens the earth he purifies himself in clear river and when fick takes grafs and other herbage with his trunk and\ slings it towards heaven as if-he thereby invoked\'92the divine affistance in his weak\ condition.\ scripture as remarkably speaking of the stork emblematically means purified\ understanding and mind exalted above earthly things for this bird always builds\ on the tops of the highest houses to save himself from the wiles of beasts and\ after hatching his young is at continual war with the snake which always creep-\ ing on the ground and into the- holes thereof is an emblem of viscious affec-\ tions wherefore in imitation of the ftork men should exait theirminds and seek\ dwelling-place in heaven where they will be freed from all the wiles of the\ flesn and the crafts of the devil.\ the ancients understood by the emblem of the cock the immortality and- divi\'ac\ nity of the foul and pythagoras commanded his followers ta feed and nurse the\ cock meaning that they should feed their souls with the knowledge of divine\ things wherefore socrates when dying full of hope of speedy-union of his im\'ac\ mortal soul-with- the-deity said he was bound in duty to offen cock to ascula-\ pius meaning the phyfician of the soul for knowing his dissolution was at hand he believed he should now be cured of all his infirmities plato\'92

ocher learned nien say that this seed implies\ the wonderful power of god which as small and contemptible feed lies hid in\ the reading of scripture and despised by many for its tartness but on chewing strengthens and oleanses the stomach corrects vapours and humidities disturbing\ the brain and refines the taste in order to our more exact search into the writings\ of wise men and divine mysteries for according to horace nemo ades ferus est ut non mitescere possit si modo cultur\'e6 patientem commodat aurem.\ or the breasts remaining wild we need not fear after good learning has

extir-\ pate by the same seed is also signified bright and vigilant soul and an high\ understanding for they who are seized with the lethargy have their heads after\ shaving rubbed with it for their recovery and thus our circumcised hearts are\ likewise with the mustard-seed cleansed from the lethargy of sin for conversion.\ pythagoras once tasting leaf of this plant afterwards much admired it and found\ that its spirits flew upwards as if alcending to heaven for the virtue going up\ the nose to the brain purges it and clears the understanding.\ democritus said that few grains of it boiled with other greens made them soft and tender let\ us in like manner so mix the emblematie mustard-seed with our divine-thoughts that when become tender they may send steam and sweet savour up to heaven where our souls united with god can no more be affected with hunger thirst\ or drowsiness but continually employed in praising the almighty.\ in this last ordonnance relating to divine we have crowded together great\ variety of objects only to shew how fruitful this subject is in materials for di-\ vinity comprising philosophy physics dialectica rhetoric logic and each of\ these affording plentiful matter the ingenious artist may by consulting good au-\ thors gain an inexhaustible treasure of things and then as he thinxs proper more easily leave out some than having too few represent them lame and defec-\ tive to the knowing.\ chap iv of the origin nature and quality of the roman tri-\ umphal crowns and other rewards of honour.\ we learn from history how noble the ancient romans were in gratifving\ the virtue valour and conduct of their citizens soldiers and commanders besides their ordinary pay with triumphal crowns jewels and other presents as an\ example to others to tread in the same steps for the good of their country and\ we judge this point very proper to be handled next to still life as it will conduce\ to make the emblematic sense of good piece more perfect.\ after commander had gained either great advantage or victory over the\ enemy in siege battle or sea-fight he according to custom made an exact in-\ quiry what persons had behaved with the greatest valour and resolution and then\ placing himself on stage raised for that purpose and returning thanks to the\ gods for the victory obtained he commended the army in general for their steady\ adherence and each company in particular which had shewed the greatest courage then naming them one after another he extolled their valour stiling them friends\ and lovers of their country and telling them how highly they obliged the com-\ monwealth by their loyalty and brave behaviour and thereupon in the name of\ the senate he distributed among them many rich presents consisting of crowns\ of gold and silver girdles gold chains bracelets rings for ears and fingers ar-\ mour shields pikes swords javelins standards sine horse furniture and other\ elegantly wrought warlike instruments which none durst use or wear but those\ who had purchased them in the manner aforesaid the roman story abounds\ with such occurrences but especially titus livius who relates that the consul pa-\ irius cursor bestowed gold bracelets among four hundred men and afterwards\ magnificently rewarded whole legion he tells us the same things of scipio\ when he waged war with spain and other countries and we read lucius antontus son of lucius fubius quadratus was twice dignified by the emperor of tiberius with\ gold ornaments for the neck and arms.\ but besides the native valour and military discipline for which the ancient ro-\ mans were particularly famous we learn from pliny and salinus that oftentimes single person by his virtue and valour obtained all the aforesaid ornaments as we\ see in marcus sergius who received almost oll those tokens of honour and even in\ the battles of thrasimenus and trebir and the bloody one at canna in all which\ the romans were defeated by hanibal he obtained civic crown it is related of\ this sergius that having in battle lost his right hand and fixed an iron one in its\ place he so managed with his left as one day to slay four armed men one after\ another and that in fights and skirmishies he had received twenty-three wounds\ in the fore-parts of his body and yet this man is inferior to lucius sicinnius den-\ tat\'e6s tatus overseer of the city of rome of whom pliny solinus valerius maximus and\ aulus gillius unanimoussy report that his great merit had gained him from the se-\ nate above three hundred and twenty honorary presents of all forts and that he\ nine times made his entrance in triumph with the generals whom by his valour\ and conduct he had assisted in their conquests and that he could shew great\ number of lances and pikes unironed which as so many tokens of honour fell to\ his share as also eighteen gold and eighty-three silver neck-ornaments twenty-\ five costly horse-furnitures an hundred and forty bracelets fourteen civic crowns eight castrenses three murals one obsidional and know not how many naval\ or rostral crowns he had received forty-five wounds and those in his fore-parts\ only disarmed the enemy thirty-four times and fought one hundred and twenty\ battles in word he was stiled the roman achilles.\ the crowns bestowed on men of particular merit had degrees of dignity and\ particular names suiting the nature of the victories as corana obsidionalis cixica triumphalis ovalis muralis navalis and castrensis.\ the corona obsidionalis or obsidional crown was the most excellent of all for\ when roman town or camp besieged and reduced to extremity was relieved by\ roman captain the commonwealth rewarded the action in the most noble man\'ac\ ner viz this crown though made of grass was accounted of more worth than\ if of gold and enriched with precious stones the grass was pulled up in the field\ of battle wherefore this crown is said to be sacred to mars which boccatius seems\ to affirm possibly because the grafs grows mostly in open places and fields of en-\ campment the great quintus fabius was in reward of his merit by the general.\ consent of the senate and roman people honoured with this crown when in the\ second punic war he delivered the city from the approaching ruin and extremity\ which hannibal had brought it to amilius scipio had the same gift in africa for\ rescuing the consul manlius and his forces out of the power of the enemy calpur-\ nius obtained the same honour in sicily as did also the incomparable lucius sicin-\ nius dentatus.\ the corona-civica or civic crown was given to him who hrd preserved roman\ citizen from imminent danger or released from captivity this crown was made\ of oak sprigs and leaves with the fruit hanging at it and by the general\'92 order who gave it to the person set at liberty put on the deliverer\'92 head but though person had saved king or other great ally of the romans from falling into the\ enemies hands yet he got not this crown which was only due to him who had freed\ roman citizen from death or slavery pliny says this crown was also presented\ to him who slew the first of the enemy besieging roman town it was next in\ dignity to the corona obsidionalis and worn on several occasions especially on the\ great festivals and solemnities and in the plays and other public sports those\ who were honoured withit sat next to the senate and at their entrance were re-\ ceived by them with all the marks of respect these persons with their fathers\ and grandfathers were entirely exempted from all charges and taxes as having\ begot sons so beneficial to the commonwealth they were also at liberty to accept\ or refuse public offices several romans obtained this honour especially the afore-\ said valiant lucius sicinnius dentatus who fourteen times gloried in it as capitolinus\ did\ did six the brave marcas sergius likewise received it from the senate and in word all those who in an extraordinary manner had benefited the city or country.\ the famous cicero was fo erowned by partieular decree of th\'e8 senate for having\ happily delivered the city from the imminent danger of the catiline conspiracy.\ thefe crowns though seemingly simple as being made of grafs and sprigs of trees were yet of greater account than thofe of gold and jewels they were of oak be-\ cause the acorn was the most ancient food and because that tree was sacred to ju-\ piter the tutelar god the victors in the capitoline games instituted by domitian as also stage-players muficians and poets were likewise crowned with oak-\ leaves.\ the corona triumphalis or triumphal crown was given to the general who hav\'ac\ ing overthrown the enemy in pitched battle had thereby either saved roman\ ally or annexed some dominion to the commonwealth wherefore he was also in\'ac\ troduced inta the city in triumph riding in gilt chariot drawn by four or accor-\ ding to some six white horses this crown was made of laurel faered to apodlo for\ its greennefs and red berries and signified that the victory is attended with much\ trouble danger and bloodfhed sextus relates that the soldiers used to follow the\ chariot of the conqueror also crouned with laurel to purify them on entering the\ city from the blood of the slain by the fuffiage of the fenate the victors in the\ wrestling games were honoured with the same crown and it was anciently given\ oo men eminent for heroic poetry and eloquence wherefore hefiod says ee the\ musea had crouned him with sceptre and erown of laurel roman priests\ and footh-sayers likewise crowned themselves with laurel even those who followed\ the army wore sprig of it on their helmet instead of feather because the tree\ was accounted and oakled by them foretelling one.\ the coronz ovalis given to genenal or other prime person who had beat the\ enemy with little refistance or having undertook the war without the exprefs com-\ mand of the senate had gined some considerable fortress town or place was made\ of myrtle-leaves tree facred to venus this crown denoted that the war was car-\ ried on without great bloodshed and therefore public rejoicings were made for it but without much triumpb when victory was gained over slaves or pirates\ and robbers the victors had the same sort of crowns because such enemies were\ judged unworthy of feeling the roman valour the principal generals who ob-\ tained this and the triumphal crowns aforesaid fhall mention among the\ triumphs.\ the coroua muralis or mural crown was the reward of soldier or officer who\ in asfaulting town of the enemy first advanced ladder and valiantly mounted\ the walls and made way for conquest this crown was of gold reprefenting\ the battlements of the town-wall they had conquered or else being like that\ which the poets afcribe to cybele the mother of the gods or mother earth round\ it were engraven lions the emblems of valour and generosity suetonius relates that common soldiers received it as well as captains and generals on public\ testimony from others that they first gained the top of the enemies walls manhus\ capitolinus was according to pliny first honoured with this crown and ipio gave\ it\ it to trebellius and sextus digitus on their jointly first mounting the enemies\ walls.\ the caroua navalis or naval crown was given to him who in sea-engagement first entered into an enemy\'92 ship and made himself master of it this crown\ was also of gold and its circie set round with ships prows marcus varro disdained\ not to receive it at the hands of pompey the great for subduing the sea-rovers.\ augustus presented it to marcus agrippa on his gaining the upper hand in the sea-\ sight off scily as he also did to sylla and several others the senate gave it to-\ gether with gold shield and other honourable gifts to the emperor claudius for\ having soon after he obtained the imperial dignity vanquished three hundred thou-\ fand barbarians in rebellion against the empire and sunk two thousand of the ene-\ mies ships.\ the same crown was the present of the ancient athenians to those who fitted out\ ships of war for the public service or first landed and intrenched on the enemies\ ground.\ the romans in process of time placed an hedge-hog on the circle of this crown because that creature\'92 defence lying in his sxin wherein he rolls himself up he\ was esteemed the emblem of sea-fight this crown is ascribed to diana or the\ moon as she inffuences the sea and its floods.\ the corona castrensis was given by the chief commander to him who in battle\ first entered the enemies camp this crown was gold circle to which were af-\ fixed palisades of the same metal they also had it who first destroyed the pali-\ sades of the enemy and th\'e8reby opened door for victory this crown was\ the reward of great number of romans in those times of valour.\ besides these degrees of honour the romans bestowed several privileges on those\ who excelled in warlike atchievements causing them in the public pleadings to\ fit in the sella cuyulis or the pretor\'92 ivory chair as we read of the great scipie and\ it often happened since all things centered in the voice and consent of the people that some of the soldiery were invested with greater power and privileges all\ generals who by conquest had enlarged the empire were allowed to set up their\ statues in the consular dress augustus to eternize the memories of all such gene\'ac\ rals as had augmented the state ordamed that next to the gods the first veneration\ should be paid to them and for that purpose built gallery in his palace wherein\ to set 'their statues with all their honorary titles notifying by proclamation that\ he did this for bimself and succeslors as an example to posterity to imitate the\ virtues and valour of such illustrious personages moreover it was laudable and\ constant custom of the senate to affign the children of fuch as fell in battle the\ liberal enjoyment of the pay of their deceafed parents and to the old and maimed\ soldiers as many lands in the provinces they conquered as would comfortably\ support them and their families for the remainder of their lives on this footing the city of seville in spain and the fruitful country round it were made roman\ colony by julius casar and corduba and several other places in divers parts of the\ world were applied to the same purpose in word roman services never missed\ reward and for this reason the commonwealth produced more brave men than\ any other nation whatsoever every one exerting himself to attain all the degrees\ of\ of honour by the strictest virtue but on the other hand the vicious and coward-\ ly were in proportion to their offences as severely punissied either by depriva-\ tion of their honourable offices and future hopes or else by being whipped with\ rods till the blood came or loaden with irons and madt slaves titus livius re-\ lates that troop of appius claudius cowardly deserting certain post which they\ were set to guard was rigoroussy punished by every tenth man\'92 being put to\ death according to lot without respect of persons julius frontinus writes that\ marcus antonius caused certain troop who had not dulv defended town-wall\ and fortification to undergo the same fate there were many other methods for\ punishing the disobedience of the roman soldiery which shall pafs by and con-\ clude with horace.\ adsit\ regula peccatis qua panas eroget \'e6quas.\ that is crimes do require the penalties of the laws and strictest justice greatest reverance draws.\ chap of the solemnities of the roman triumphs.\ two motives generally incite man to do great things either in times of\ peace or war to wit honour and immortal fame or riches and profit.\ generous souls always aspire at the former and reject the latter as below them.\ the roman governinent knew perfectly well how to make its advantage of these in-\ ducements in the encouragements given to its subjects and we shall begin with\ the triumphs by which they honoured and rouzed the valiour of their heros.\ the triumph was an entrance and welcome of general by decree of the se-\ nate after an happy expedition and the conclusion of war whereby in the\ most solemn and pompous manner they shewed him their great esteem on\ the day of entry the inhabitants of all the towns flocked to rome and the whole\ citv temples streets gates houses and windows were hung with all sorts of\ costly stuffs in gold silver and silk and beautifully decked with great variety of\ green branches and flowers in word nothing was wanting to shew either the\ power magnificence or joy of the romans on this occasion the senate clergy nobility and most eminent citizens and therefore the greatest part of rome richly\ dressed met the conqueror without the town gates he sat in an ivory chair called sedes curulis in gold chariot sparkling with precious stones and drawn\ cither by four or six white horses magnificiently equipped and was dressed in garment of purple and gold called toga palmata crowned with laurel and the staff\ of\ of command in his hand or else winged image of victory holding crown of\ laurel or palm branch.\ sometimes this figure was placed behind him holding\ in its right hand crown of laurel over his head as we see it both ways in the\ ancient bass reliefs and medals the prisoners of war dressed like slaves and\ with shorn heads and the king or general with the most eminent of the van-\ quishied were led in fettered couples before the chariot which the roman legions-\ followed in troops or companies on foot and horse-back in their order richly\ armed and with their pikes and lances twined with laurel as token of general\ joy but they who had most singulized themselves in valour marched on each\ side of the chariot with crowns of laurel on their heads and palm branches in\ their hands before the conqueror went likewise some carriages laden with the\ arms banners gold and silver vases jewels gold and silver coin taken as booty\ from the eneniy together with the gifts and presents he had received from the\ friends and allies of the romans next came some castles and towers of wood ele-\ gantly carved resembling the towns and fortresses gained of the enemy in their\ passage the army feigned some battles in so lively manner as thereby to affect\ the spectators with all sorts of paffions as forrow joy and fright the variety\ of those sights was so great and excessive as to spin out the cavalcade for three or\ four days and being arrived at the capital all the arms and booty called ma-\ nubiae taken from the enemy were hung up and deposited in the temple of ju-\ piter as an eternal memorial of the virtue of the conquerers here the senate re-\ turned them thanks for the service done to their country and commonly chusing\ the victor as coajutor in the government the joy concluded with magnificent\ entertainment but for forming better idea of these triumphs and the order\ therein observed ishall as far as my memory will permit give some examples\ of them out of the roman histories.\ plutarch describes the triumph voted to paulus amilias for his victory over the\ great perseus king of macedonia in this manner.\ first the people of rome and the neighbouring towns magnificiently dressed appeared at the doors and windows in the balconies garrets and on tops of\ houses in great multitudes as spectators of the solemnity all the temples in\ rome richly adorned were set open the houses and streets were wonderfully\ garnished with all sorts of costly hangings and filled with greens flowers choice\ perfumes and thousand other fine and delightful things and as the concourse\ of people was very great men with staves were appointed to make and preseve lane or passage through them for the march of the triumphers the first day\ was spent in the procession of the banners standards ensigns statutes colosses pictures and figures all placed on carriages elegantly painted and slowly driven.\ the second day was taken up with the passage of the bright armour of the van-\ quishied king and macedonians placed on neat chariots or carriages made for that\ purpose to these succeeded three thousand men partly carrying the gold and\ silver coin in three hundred and fifty large silver dishes and vases each weighing\ three talents and carried by four men the remainder of these men bore\ fountains and stately vases of filver artfully wrought on the third day appeared\ the first company preceded by great number of pipers drums hautboys and\ trumpets trumpets making warlike mufic as if preparing for an onset these were\ followed by hundred and twenty cows decked with gilt horns and sacred linen\ coverings and all sorts of green garlands wreathed with flowers led for victims by beautiful voung men richly dressed and succeeded by company of children carrying gold and silver dissies for the use of the sacrifice after these came the\ bearers of the gold vases with gold coin in numberseventy-two followed by several\ great officers of the retinue of antigonus and seleucus late kings of mucedonia and\ even of perseus himself carry ing the excessive large gold vessel weigh ing ten talents and enriched with all sorts of precious stones and diamonds which was made\ by amilius\'92 express order next to these appeared the body-chariot of the con-\ quered king and therein his coat of arms diadem or royal head-band crown\ and ceptre then followed the children of the unhappy prince attended by great numnber of his courtiers as stewards secretaries and other such domestics weeping and lamenting their slavery in such manner as considering the vicitude\ of human affairs to raise compassion in the spectators especially the sight of the\ three innocent children two sons and daughter who by reason of their tender\ age were insensible of their unhappy condition after these appeared the father\ dressed in black according to the custom of his country and walking full of\ terror and concern on this occasion next to him came his friends favourites and confidents who fixing their eyes onhim and bitterly weeping moved many\ of the romans themselves with tears in their eyes to pity both their and the king\'92\ forrowful condition to these fucceeded the gold crowns which the ancient free\ cities had presented to the conquerer as gratulation for his victory and then\ came amilius himself sitting on gold triumphal chariot dressed in purple\ garment richly wrought with gold with larurel branch in his hand and crown of the same on his head he was followed by the army horse and foot orderly marshalled under their proper ensigns having garlands of laurel and palm\ branches in their hands and singing hymns in praise of the victor and victory.\ thus paulus amilius made his triumphal entrance into the famous city of romt where he offered the booty in the temple of jupiter capitolinus and returned the\ god thanks for his victory and triumph.\ all other triumphs were managed much in the same manner with abatement\ of some circumstances according to the pleasure of the general who was honoured\ with them.\ and though we find the solemnities regulated by laws precisely directing in\ what manner at what time and through what gates and streets the cavalcade\ was to pafs yet as for the plays shews and other less appertenances they were\ lessened or augmented at the will of the victor with liberty to chuse the chariot.\ history tells us that the chariot was commonly drawn by four white horses but\ we also find bulls used for the same purpose pompy the great having subdued\ africa made his entry on chariot drawn by elephants suctonius relates that\ julus caesar triumphed in one with forty elephants the emperor gordianus\ triumphed in the same manner caius marius having subjected afiica and extend-\ ed the roman jurisdiction into agypt was drawn by the same kind of beasts sci-\ po agricanus triumphed with-elephants for the same reafon the emperor augustas\ on\ on his victorious return from the east and ending the war with anthony was by\ the confent of the senate and people of rome drawn by four elephants the em-\ peror vespasian had the same honour on finishing several great wars in the east the elephants denoting the conquest of countries where those creatures breed.\ flavius in his histories tells us that the emperor aurelian who was king of the\ goths made his entrance on chariot drawn by stags but marcus antonius made\ use of tame lions intimating that in the civil wars he would make the most va-\ liant submit to his commands which cicero in his orations called philippicae objects him saying that his triumphal chariot with lions implied an arbitrary\ man aiming at monarchy.\ the roman generals when they triumphed had also custom of carrying one\ or more young children in their chariots as we gather from cicero\'92 speech before\ murena some used to be attended with great number of strange wild beasts as lions bears tigers rhinoceroses panthers dromedaries and such like as\ josephus in his histories of the vespasians mentions others had vocal and instru-\ mental music and other diversions among these triumphs those of pompy the\ great casar the two scipio\'92 brothers and several emperors had something\ singular as blondus in his treatise intitled rome triumphant largely discourses.\ the triumphing conquerors were likewise allowed to set up their statues in temples\ and public places and to erect columns and costly structures of marble called\ arcus triumphales whereon were carved in bass relief their battles and victories\ for eternal monuments to posterity remains whereof we see to this day at rome\ and elsewhere herein the romans imitated the ancient greeks who for memo-\ rial of great actions set up trophies made in the following manner.\ in the place of victory they fixed the highest tree to be found in the neigh-\ bourhood and then chopping of the branches they in honour to the victor hung on the remaining limbs the arms of the vanquished calling that tree tro-\ phaeum from the greek word tropi which signifies overthrow slight and giving\ way because the enemies were in that place put to flight the romans afterwards\ made use of them for the same purpose for sallustius in his memoirs relates that\ pompey having conquered the spaniards planted his trophies on the tops of the\ highest pyrenees and this custom afterwards grew into such esteem that they\ were made of stone but according to scripture the usuage was very ancient\ among other nations for it appears in chap of sam that saul having\ vanquished agag king of the amalelites and being come to mount carmel set up\ an arcus triumphalis or place in word the honour of triumphing was ac-\ counted by the romans as token of the highest esteem and therefore to obtain\ it their generals spared for no toils or dangers in warlike atchievements add to\ this the riches commonly arising from such glory by the presents made them\ by the allies and the booty of the enemy.\ in my opinion historians have described the matter so circumstantially on\ purpose to put princes and governors in mind of rewarding the deserts of their\ generals soldiers and men of merit and that the uuskilful cowardly and unfit\ for command iight not be ranged with those who willingly sacrificed their for-\ tunes capacities and bodily labours to the benefit of their country accordingly\ to\ to paulus orofiris three hundred and twenty persons have been honoured with the\ roman triumph of whom the emperor probut in whose feign the fabric of the\ roman monarchy began to decay was the last.\ let us here subjoin grecian triump antiochus surnamed epiphanes or the il-\ lustrious king of sria having heard of the aforesaid glorious triumph of paalus\ amilius was so puffed up with ambition that he resolved to make fort of one\ furpassing it in magnificence to which end he caused proclamation to be made\ throughout his kingdom that at certain time he would at daphnes hold grand\ and uncommon tournament which curiofity drew out of greece and the neigh-\ bouring countries great concourse of people and the cavalcade was in the\ following manner.\ first marched five thousand grecian young men armed roman like followed\ by as many mysians finely habited after their fafhion next appeared three\ thousand thracians and five thousand galatians followed by vast number of other\ nations called for their silver shields argyraspides after these came two hun-\ dred and fifty ranks of sword-players called by the romans gladiators and then\ thousand knights with chaplets of gold about their heads and their horses\ costly equipped with gold embroidered housings and gold and silver bridles.\ these were followed by thousand other knights called companions afsociated\ with some of the king\'92 friends and confidents then appeared thousand\ noblemen on foot and after them thousand other knights called the king\'92\ troops next came one thousand five hundred knights in gold armour over\ which they had coats of armour richly embroidered with gold and silver and art-\ fully adorned with all sorts of animals to these succeeded an hundred chariots each drawn by fix horses followed by forty others each with four after these\ appeared chariot with elephants followed by thirty-six of the same kind of\ creatures and those by eight hundred boys having garlands aud crowns orna-\ mented with gold in their hands next came thousand fat oxen with eight\ hundred indian elephants teeth after these were carried an infinite number of\ idols and figures of deceased persons who had been famous for arts and sciences dressed in gold and silver stuffs adorned with precious stones with their names dignities and actions written on the pedestals then came slaves bearing idols representing night and morning mid-day and evening and an infinite number\ of gold and silver vessels of great value next appeared six hundred of the king\'92\ pages dressed in gold stuffs followed by two hundred ladies carrying gold boxes silled with all manner of rich perfumes and ordoriferious balm and these by forty\ sedans of massy silver carrying as many ladies and those by eighty gold sedans\ with ladies dressed in gold silver and jewels the streets abounded with all sorts\ of rich oils balms and perfumes this cavalcade lasted thirty days successively attended with plays tournaments and shews during which time every person after perfuming himself was allowed to fit at the royal tables one thousand five\ hundred in number and to feast at the king\'92 expence to proceed to the\ romans.\ another solemnity obtained among them cafled ovatio which was inferior\ to the triumph in fome of its requisites for instance if the victor was not of\ consular or proconsular dignity or had met with little resistence from the enemy or gained the victory without great blood-shed or had overcome people of fmal\ worth or as we faid speaking of the corona ovalis when the war was under-\ taken without the express command of the senate in such cases the victorg\ were solemnly welcomed with the ovatio in the following manner.\ the general entered the city on horse-back or as anciently on foot crowned\ with myrtle tree facred to venus because the victory was gained not in martial manner but in manner becoming that goddess and women as aulus\ gellius says and the troops in their possession appeared not in arms and instead\ of druins trumpets and other warlike instruments their music was flutes and\ other soft founds the general entered with the booty in an orderly manner followed by his army and the senate solemnly received him without the city-gates\ highly commending his actions histories tells us that several great generals\ sued for and accepted this honour the first was posthumius libertus on his having\ subdued the sabines and next marcus marcellus after the conquest of svracuse sue-\ tonius telates that augustus after the battle of philippi and on finilhing the war\ in sicily obtained that honour and pliny says that several generals denied by\ the senate the honour of the great triumph were decreed the ovatio which was\ so called from the general\'92 offering fheep in latin ovis when he came to the\ is derived from the shouts of the people who used to cry oel or else ove whatever the truth is this solemn entrance was always called by the romans ovatio.\ other triumphs of these people ishall for brevity omit speaking of he who\ wants further information may read appianus alexandrinus and ammiannus marcellinus the former describing the triumph of scipio africanus and the latter that of the\ emperor constantius.\ chap vi of the manner of the four principal and public\ grecian games and to whose honour instituted.\ hhe antiquity and manners of the grecian games being somewhat unknown\ to many curious artists ithink it will be acceptable to give fhort descrip-\ tion as well as can of the four principal games so highly and so often extolled\ by the greek and roman writers.\ the first and principal were called the obympic games held near the city of\ obmpia in the province of elis and instituted in honour of jupiter olympius by\ the idan hercules and his four brothers p\'9coneus idas jasius and epimedes meet-\ ing together from mount lda in candia and being five brethren they were stiled\ the\ ldaan dactyls these games being celebrated every five years with great solem-\ nity the ancients therefore reckoned their time by obympiads thereby under-\ standing period of five years they consisted of five sorts of exercifes viz.\ running wrestling boxing throwing the coit and leaping the place of exer-\ cise was fenced in with pales and no spectator was suffered to come\ within it.\ some pretend these games were instituted by jupiter after he had destroyed the\ giants who attempted to storm heaven and that apollo had got the preference in\ out-running mercury that mars bore away the prize in wrestling boxing .\ others prove that each of the aforesaid bretheren invented his game and ex-\ ercise and that being five in number they were from the five fingers named\ dactyls dactylos in greek signifying finger.\ the greeks called these five exercises pentathlon and the lattins quinquertium.\ two of them had dependence on the legs viz running and leaping two on the\ arms as coits and boxing and the wrestling respected both arms and legs the\ victor in all the five exercises was by the greeks called pancratiastes word com-\ pounded of pan and kratos signifying bestowing whole force of the body.\ prize was adjudged to him who gained his point most dextrouslsy accordingly they struck with fists and elbows kicked bit scratched and sprained the\ fingers hands and other parts of the body they even endeavoured to thrust out\ each others eyes with their thumbs in short no artifice was omitted for gaining\ the victory.\ we shall briefly relate in what manner the aforesaid five excercises were\ performed.\ the circus wherein they run on foot was originally stadium or six hundred\ geomitrical feet in length but in the fourth olympiad they doubled it this\ race was at first on foot and in alight dress but afterwards on horse-back and in\ armour men called runners on foot were also admitted armed srom top to\ toe this excercise being judged very proper for the bodies of warriors the\ first victor herein was demaratus of herea and the hymns sung in their honour sufficiently testify their running in armour but the first who got the prize in run-\ ning without armour was chorabus of elis after long contest with him about\ it arrachion of phigalia obtained the prize in the second and third excercifes and\ polycrates of messene man of noble extraction got much honour and glory in\ the fourth wherein he was victor.\ the wrestling was undertaken after the body had been thoroughly anointed\ in order to prevent gripe and then daubed with fine dust to dry the sweat.\ thus prepared the wrestlers entered the lists and began with seizing the hands then the arms and body under the short ribs thus endeavouring by va-\ rious methods of strength and dexterity in kicking pufhing and othet tricks to\ fling one another on their backs for fall on the belly went for nothing be\'ac\ fore they entered the ring they caused their parts to be soundly rubbed to make\ them more supple and agile.\ boxing\ boxing and fighting with flings were the most dangerous exercifes the for-\ mer was anciently performed with ox-leather thongs tied about the hands by\ but\ which with wonderful activity they dealt each other with very hard blows.\ the slings consisted of small leather straps armed at the ends with little leaden balls the blow whereof when it happened on the head laid the adversary dead.\ the coit was flat round heavy piece of stone or lead to try the force of\ armsand hands and to see who could sling highest and furthest an excercise still\ in use in many places to this day but with this difference that the ancients with\ leg lifted up threw the coit at mark set up on small pyramid and resembling\ pine-apple.\ the fifth excercise was lefs perilous as consisting only of divers manners of\ leaping.\ the ancient garlands or crowns given as prize to the victor on these occasions were made of olive leaves but they varied according to the times for they\ were afterwards composed of couch grass willow laurel myrtle oak palm\ and wild parsley leaves as plutarch in the life of cato uticensis relates but when\ made of olive leaves they chose select kind called calistephancs beauti-\ ful crown having hanging branches like the myrtle very proper for twisting\ garlands the leaves of such garland differed much from others in that being\ white without the green when twisted was inward whereas the others were\ white within and appeared green without hercules and his bretheren first\ brought this plant into greece from the northern countries as pausanias in his\ olympus tells us.\ the phythian games were instituted long before the lsthmian yet after the olym-\ pic and celebrated in honour of apollo for his victory over the frightful serpent\ python some think they were so called from pythos the place of celebra-\ tion or else from the greek word pythestai to consult because they there con-\ sulted the oracle in order to know the events of things to come the exercifes\ in these games only differed in the olympic in this that the phythian were performed\ under the sound of all sorts of vocal and instrumental music these games from\ time to time had several alterations in form and solemnity after the institution of\ the pancratium or quinquertiam and it is related that in the first \'e0 pythiades wherein the most illustrious heroes and gods of the ancients entered the lists for\ the sake of the prize castor prevailed in the horse-race pollux in boxing callais\ in running on foot zethees in running in compleat armour peleus in throwing.\ the coit telamon in wrestling and hercules in the pancratium or all the games.\ in each of these games and exercifes the victors were crowned with laurel which in particular was consecrated to them because the ancients believed by\ what they have feigned of peneus\'92 daughter with whom apollo was so much en-\ amoured and who was metamorphosed into that tree that the god took singu-\ lar delight in it but others will have the institution of the phythian games to\ be long before apollo\'92 amour with the beautiful daphne and before the laurel\ pythiades signifies certain number of years in the pythian games.\ bore\ bore that distinction both the triumphal and victors crowns and garlands were\ made of palm or oak-leaves as ovia in his first book of metamorphofis teftifies.\ plutarch and pausanias relate that theseus on his return from creia adorned the\ victors in the games instituted in honour of apollo with garlands of palm of praise and renown for the laurel was not known till after the phythin\ games were settled and when known it gave rise to the aforesaid fable of daphne and both the tree and leaves being found of so extraordinary make and nature illustrious victors and men of learning were commonly crowned with it some\ again say that apollo affected the leaves and blossoms of the apple-tree before he\ chose the laurel and therefore the victors in running wrestling ought to be\ crowned with that as the poet archias in his mytholog lib cap relates but lucianus afferts that though in the phythian games the garlands of laurel be-\ gan to prevail yet they were intermixed with sine yellow apples some writers\ even affirm that the laurel of delphos bore such large berries or fruit as almoft\ to gain\'92the name of apples but the true reason of this difference proceeded\ from the several alterations made both in the prizes and times of holding those\ games for originally they were celebrated every ninth year from the number of\ nymphs feigned by the ancients to come from mount parnassus to offer to apcllo\ on his having overcome the delphic monster python and afterwards every\ fifth.\ the nemaan games were kept in wood of that name situate between phliuns\ and cleona two cities of achia in honour and memory of archemorus otherwise\ called opheltes son of lycurgus on account of his being killed by serpent in this\ wood which accident some relate thus oedepus having through mistake mar-\ ried his own mother the widow of laus king of thebes begat on her two fons eteocles and polynice to whom he resigned the royal dignity on condition they\ governed by turns but eteocles as the eldest having obtained the first year\'92 admi\'ac\ fistration refused to admit his brother as partner to govern the second year who thereupon in discontent soliciting the aid of adrastus king of argos whose\ daughter called argia he married the king in conjunction with his other son-in-\ law zydeus raised great army in order to wage war with the thebans and bring\ them to reafon the issue of-this war was the death of the two \'92others in duel and their bodies according to custom being laid on large pile of wood\ to be burnt the flames happened to divide and seperate as if they bore witness\ of their immortal hatred of the two bretheren in their life-times which ceased not\ with their deaths now in the army which adrastus sent to polynices\'92 assistance\ were seven commanders who being arrived in the island lemnos pertaining to\ thracia and seized with an extreme thirst met hypsipyle carying in her arms\ the child opheltes son of lycurgus priest of jupiter and euridice whom being\ native of that country they intreated to shew them where to get some water.\ whereupon she in haste vet fearful of laying the child on the ground as for-\ bidden by the oracle before he could walk set him naked on the grafs by bed\ of wild parsley near fountain where serpent lying perdue suddenly wound it-\ self about the childs neck and throttled him while she was gone to draw water.\ the commanders being apprised of this accident killed the serpent and to solace\ the\ the father instituted in honour of his son so suddenly lost the aforesaid games to\ beheld every third year wherefore originally only soldiers and their descendants\ were admitted to them though in procefs oftime they were free for every person.\ theagnes in his memoirs of agina book chap relates that hypsipyle fled from\ lemnes to nemda on account of combination among the women to kill the men only out of jealousy because by the instigation of venus highly ineensed against\ them they had to do with other women accordingly they all put their de-\ sign in practice except hypsipyle who endeavoured to save her father\'92 life by\ hiding him in baker\'92 trough this happened soon after the departure of the\ argonaats and their arrival in this island but being discovered they flung him\ with the trough into the sea and condemned hypsipyle to die for not agreeing to\ their general resolution she hearing this made her escape but in her flight was taken by pirates and sold for slave to lycurgus whose wife euridice de-\ firing fhe might be put to death for the misfortune of her child she hid herself in\ remote and solitary place where being discovered by the sooth-sayer amphiaraus to the two sons of euridice thoas and eunoenus who made diligent search after\ her she was through their intercession and the commanders testimony of her\ innocence pardoned and re-admitted into favour others will have it that her-\ cules instituted these games on having killed in the wood nemaa terrible lion who devoured all before him and laid the country waste some say they were set\ up in honour and memory of archemorus but that hercules after having slain the\ nemaan lion with whose skin he covered his head and body broughth them un-\ der \'e0 regulation and dedicated them to jupiter appointing their solemnization\ to be every three years on the day of the month called by the corinthians panemos and by the athenians boedromibs answering to our month of august and\ the rather as theseus had in that month happily vanquished the amazons but\ oth\'e8rs are of opinion that it was done in memory of opheltes who by his own death\ presaged the fate of the lacedemonians at war with the thebans yet some think\ that 'this was another opheltes son of euphetas and geusa who being laid on the\ ground by his nurse while she went to shiew some commanders fountain was\ killed by serpent.\ the nemaan games were therefore instituted in memory and consolation of\ lycurgus etridice and opheltes and the judges who determined the prizes were\ dressed in black and mourning garments for opheltes was afterwards called ar-\ chemorus because amphiaraus had at his birth presaged him an early and untime-\ ly death archo signifying in greek begining and moros death as if they said\ ee dying shortly after his birth in which sense speaks the poet ee naseentes morimur finisque ab origine pendet '\ that is ee we begin dying from our births and our beginnings and ends have\ an inseparable union.\ the excercises in these games were the same as in others but the victors\ were crowned with green parsley mostly used in funerals to perpetuate the me-\ end\ mory of archemorus whether the greek selinon with us common parsley\ the\ the petroselinon or stone parsley be the same let the botanists determine originally\ the victors were crowned with garlands of olives but after the defeat of the\ medes they began to be presented with one of wild parsley in memory of those\ who were slain in that bloody battle and afrer this regulation the said herb in-\ stead of crouning the head on occasions of joyful meetings served only in times\ of sorrow and mourning for according to the greek saying this herb is very\ earthy as spreading long time over the ground and often bearing to be dug up\ in order to get \'e0 deeeper root the seed or it also on sowing is longer than others\ in coming up wherefore it was necessary that the mortal greek ophelies after-\ wards as we have said called art hemorus should be crowned with earthly honour.\ for of the four principal games which we handle in this chapter two according\ to the poet archias are sacred to mortals and the others to deities the mortals\ are archemorus and meliceria whois also called palamon and the gods are jupi-\ ter and apollo the wild parsley is not without reason appropriated to these\ ganies because some think it sprung from the blood of the child killed by the\ serpent yet this contradicts these who say that hypsipyle laid the child on this\ plant which therefore was alreedy known at that time we shall now proceed\ to the isthmian games.\ this solemnity was performed at night in the isthmus of corinth parting morea\ from the continent of greece and had rather the face of facrifice and its mysteries\ than of festival it was instituted by sisyphas son of aolus on his finding there-\ on the ground the dead body of his kinsman melcerta.\ plutarch writes that theseus after having killed the bull of minos and performed.\ other great exploits errected pillar in the lsthnius of peloponnesus where in imi-\ tation of hercules who consecrated the olympic games to jupiter he instituted\ the isthmian in honour of neptune.\ yet according to pausanias and others these games were not set up for that\ reason but in remembrance of melicerta\'92 dead body found there unburied touching which there goes this story learchus and meliceria were the sons of\ alhamas and ino athamas made raging mad by tifiphone at juno\'92 command attempted to kill his wife instead of wild beast tearing the young learches out\ of her arms beat out his brains against the stones ino affrighted hereat either\ through sorrow or the insluence of tisiphone\'92 poisoned serpents betook herself\ with the other child melicerta to the mountains geranes situated between megara\ and corinth but she sinally also yeilding to rage cast herself with the child\ from the rock moluris into the sea where she was metamorphosed into sea\ nymph and called leucotha and he into sea god under the name of palamon\ the dead body of melicerta being afterwards brought on shore by dolphin sisiphas king of crinth who was bis uncle commanded him to be buried in the\ isthmus and circus to be there erected for the celebration of the aforesaid\ games.\ but the poet aachias says that on ino\'92 slinging herself with meliceria into the\ sea dolphin landed their bodies on the \'92chaenuntian shore where amphimuchus\ and lonacinus took them up and brougnt them to sispphus king of corinth and\ then-\ then they were deified she by the name of lezrothea which in greek signifies the\ white goddess and he by that of palaemon.\ leucotha called by the latins matuta is day-break and palamon or portunus the vehemence of storms and billows for pallein in greek signifies to toss move and pusn violently against each other whence comes the name of palamon he\ was the son of matuta or morning because the winds commonly begin to arise\ with day-break.\ others tell us that melicerta\'92 dead body being cast on the shore of the isthmus and lying unburied it caused great plague and that on consulting the oracle touching the cause of the infection answer was made that melicerta ought to have\ \'b0 magnificent funeral and solemn races and games should be appointed to his ho\'ac\ nour and memory the corinthians obeyed and the body was accordingly taken\ up by amphimacus and donacinus and in an honourable manner buried in the place\ aforesaid and the games and funeral rites being instituted the plague ceased but afterwards it broke out afresn on their omiffion of the solemnity wnerefore in\ this their utmost distress the people re-consulting the oracle were told they must\ for ever celebrate the games they had begun in memory of meliceria and distri-\ bute the rewards to the victors but musaeus describing these games says that\ the custom was to perform every five years two forts of games and races in the\ isthmus one in honour of neptune near his temple and the other in memory of\ melicerta.\ the prize in the isthmian games was originally crown of parsl\'e9y elegantly\ wreathed but afterwards garland of pine-leaves on account of their neigh-\ bourhood and agreement with the seas besides these crowns the victors were\ usually presented on their return with palm-branch as pausanias says more-\ over the conquerors at such times were so much honoured as to be met by their\ fellow-citizens and brought some mil\'e9s upon their shoulders they made not\ their entrance through the common gates like other people but triumphantly\ over stately bridge or passage made over the walls for that purpose and their\ names were cut on pillars set up in the public places of the town to perpetuate\ their memories.\ we shall to conclude this chapter subjoin fhort description of some particu-\ lar garlands or crowns sacred to the heathenisn deities.\ the phaonicians as euscbius testifies honoured and worshipped the herbs and\ plants the grec\'e8s in imitation of them rendered almost the same duties not\ only to trees but also to herbs and flowers these maintained that the charities or\ three graces were the very crowners of pandora pherecydes says that saturn was\ crowned before any others yet according to diodorus jupiter claims this honour\ for his conquest over the giants but not to pretermit the agyptian monuments isis first crowned herself with green sprigs and ears of corn of which according\ to the agyptian writer leon she was the inventor.\ the oak and its fruit as apollodorus writes were sacred to the goddess rhea otherwise called the earth that mortals who proceed from it might wear the\ badges of their universal mother the same tree was also peculiar to jupiter the\ tutelar god.\ the pine and its fruit were consecrated to the goddess cbele whom the an-\ cients believed to be the mother of all things because she carefully containing the\ seed originally given her does by the warmth of the sun yearly bring forth new\ shoots the pine-apple in its shape also resembles rising flame and keeps its\ seed in small and separate cells which by the earth\'92 heat in time springs up and\ grows we likewise see certain medal with the head of gbele on one side and\ small garland of pine-twigs on the other and inscribed emtpnaian .\ those of smyrna the arcadians believing pan to be the god of the universe de-\ dicated the pine-apple to him also.\ saturn jupiter apollo and asculapius were crowned with laurel saturn as the\ god of triumphs jupiter for his victory over the giants apollo for the love of\ daphne metamorphosed into that tree though before the palm was sacred to\ him on his killing the delphic dragon but asculapius wears it for no other rea-\ son than that it is useful for several remedies.\ the ancient romans on their nona capretinae or festivals kept monthly in honour\ of juno crowned that goddess with fig-leaves as memorial of the city of rome\ reduced to the utmoss extremity by the gauls who demanded of the senate seve-\ ral noble virgins as hostages regaining its fre\'ebdom by the contrivance of the vir-\ gin philoris who shewing the romans how to slide down from the walls by the\ branches of fig-tree growing thercon and sacred to juno gave them an oppor-\ tunity of falling on the enemy when drunk and asleep which sne had cunningly\ inticed them to and by great slaughter to obtain compleat victory over them.\ the pomegranate was consecrated to juno by the people of mycena the white\ lilly is alfo sacred to her and therefore called flos junonius or according to some flos regalis not so much out of respect to the queen or goddess but because that\ slower almost surpasses all others in height.\ minerva who is said to be virgin rightfully laid claim to the olive-tree which\ affects purity and chastity as well as she.\ find no trees particularly sacred to mars but it is notorious that the herb\ commonly called dog\'92 grass is appropriated to him.\ they who are conversant with poets know that the myrtle-tree signifies delight\ and mind richly endowed the ancients say that tree surpasses all others in ten-\ der and beautiful leaves and their continual greenness and smell which recom-\ mends it to venus the most beautiful most tender and most perfect of the god-\ desses in- old times men on festival days used to put into each others hands\ branches of this tree as tokens of joy and that they should join in chorus and\ horace says that in lent-time when the earth by her variety of flowers seems to\ rejoice we ought to adorn our heads with wreaths of myrtle the apple-tree sig-\ nifying love is also sacred to venus and the ears of corn to ceres.\ the ivy dedicated to bacchus was in great esteem among the agyptians for being\ always green and not shedding\ its leaves till after harvest they mostly used it in\ garlands and the kind bearing\ black-berries was especially consecrated to bacchus who by that people is called ofiris and from whence this green also borrows its\ nanie for they called it cenofiris the plant of ofiris and dionysius which is\ likewise the name of bacchus having carried his victories into india built there\ nsa nysa large town and planted it round with ivy to perpetuate his memory this\ plant is facred to bacchus either because he as well as phaebus is always represented\ youthful or that the tongue and spirits of father liber are tied up as the ivy\ catches hold of any thing that it comes at for though horace says ee that the\ drunkard is in his cups free from all care even the greatest poverty \'92\'92 yet it is as\ true that the liquor captivates the senses taking away all power of judging the\ same plant is likewife an emblem of age not only for its growing mostly\ near old trees buildings and ruins but also as wine which is old and worked off is highly esteemed wherefore pindarus as well as horace mostly extols it the\ vine was also sacred to bacchus accordingly he is often represented crowned with\ the twigs thereof though after his conquest of india he likewise wore laurel for\ he as well as saturn is accounted the god of triumphs the vine was also pecu-\ liar to rhea and the crown of its twigs which adorns the head of hecate implies\ only the subtilties and snares which father faunus by the operations of wine lead-\ in men to extravagance laid for his daughter.\ he cypress is sacred to pluto god of hell and of the sprigs and leaves of it the\ ancients made garlands it is reckoned mournful tree and proper for places of\ burial because when once cut it fhoots no more its branches set in the ground\ near tombs or carved on them signify that the deceased endeavoured by prayers to be reconciled to the infernal gods wherefore horace says ee men are attended\ to hell by no other tree than the unhappy and hateful cypress pluto\'92 crown is\ also composed of the herb adianthum otherwise called capilli veneris some have\ crowned him with narcissus flowers and their leaves flower proper for deceased\ persons on account of the unhappy end of the youth who was transformed into it wherefore phurnutus says that the hellisn furies alecto tisiphone and megara hed\ garlands of the same flower about their heads as servants and executioners of the\ commands of pluto the pine-tree has much agreement with the cypress it being\ also the emblem of death for when once cut like the cypress it never shoots\ out again wherefore and for its bitterness and sharpness the pine-apple both\ in ancient and modern acceptation signifies death.\ the double-coloured poplar was sacred to hercules because naturalists by this\ hero and the two colours of that tree imply the two different times which su-\ perintend and govern all things for one of the colours being white signifies the\ day and the other which is dark the night some have also ranked the poplar\ in the number of unhappy trees for in the isse of rhodes the funeral games in\ honcur of tlepolemus were celebrated and the performers of them crowned.\ with it.\ the peach-tree was sacred to lsis and to harpocrates the plane-tree to the\ genii and garland of flowers to ariadne the bacchanals in celebrating tke\ vine-fcast of bacchus were coifed with greens.\ if the curious reader desires further information in this point he may consult\ the histories of claudius saturninus wherein he will find the origin causes qualities and every thing else relating thereto in such manner as to observe that there are\ no beautiful flowers green branches leaves roots but what are peculiar to\ the head of some person or other.\ chap vii of the military dresses and arms of several nations particularly of the greeks and romans.\ he distinction of nations can not be well represented without due regard to\ their warlike accoutrements dresses and manners.\ it is certain that many\ painters have been herein very deficient as appears by their works who on better\ consideration and greater experience have afterwards corrected their errors but\ mean not by exposing the mistakes of other men to palliate my own have\ had my faults as well and perhaps greater than they am sensible that even\ in my very best time was not free from some great blunders which to this day\ am concerned for and which though might conceal nevertheless lay open in\ the course of this work and since am speaking of mistakes shall here ob-\ serve some as necessary to this chapter.\ testa in print of the dragging of hector\'92 body represents achilles though greek with roman head-piece which he posfibly did to keep the light together\ and to preserve the face he also exhibits both those heroes naked and achilles\ without arms the sword in his hand makes him look more like gladiator than\ general and the scabbard by his side has no tie or girdle about his body how\ can he use the sword when with one hand he holds the reins of the horfes these things are very improper and unnatural but perhaps his inducement was that he might shew the beautiful body of the hero with greater advantage in\ the last place the town walls appear so low as to be easily reached over.\ poussin likewise in the print of the death of germanicus has intermixed greek\ with roman helmets let it not be thought that we are unjust to the merits op\ such great masters by so nice an examen of their performances fince my purpofe\ herein is only by shewing other mens faults to correct our own but am as wil-\ ling to shew mine as they occur to my memory witness my anens receiving the\ aris of venus where have also made roman helmet and my father in his re-\ presentation of seneca introduces one of nero\'92 captains standing by him with greek head-piece now art allows not such liberties either in military furniture\ or any thing else each nation has its particular dress manners and customs.\ how ean we exhibit an agyptian prospect without shewing some tokens of that\ country as palm-trees pyramids and people dressed in the agyprian mode let me recommend care to every person and that they do not build too\ much on other mens works it is better to be nice than negligent let us un-\ derstand thing never fo well we may yet err through hafte or careleffness.\ thinking it presumptuous to enumerate all the particulars of the military or-\ der of the ancients as being largely handled by several authors we shall therefore according to our small ability and for the service of curious artists only touch\ brieffy\ briefly on some of the principal matters relating to their arms believing the re-\ sidue will follow in the course of their practice shall begin with the greeks.\ the greek foot were divided into two forts pikemen or heavy-armed and\ archers or light-armed the pikemen used buckler fort of boots pike\ twenty or twenty-four feet in length and sword the stoutest had for defence macedonian round shield of four feet diameter the archers bore bucklers of\ wicker bows short pikes and flings they wore long hair and beards and hel-\ mets or head-pieces somewhat projecting over the face handsomely wrought with\ imagery or foliage set off with plumes and other elegant ornaments their military\ dresses always excelled in variety and elegance their coats of armour reached\ down to the knees cut out on the shoulders and below into straps which were\ often adorned with lions-heads some instead of straps had twisted fringes the\ generals and nobility wore buskins of young lions or tigers-skins or else neat\ fandals but the inferior sort had plain sandals with strings their swords hung by\ by their left side by sinall hook on the girdle and on their right side was dagger.\ in the roman military order the young men between seventeen and twenty-five\ years of age were appointed for velites or swift footmen or light-armed the\ hastati for darters or pikemen such as were in their prime for principes and the\ aged for triarii.\ the velites wore small buckler of foot and half long an head-piece sword and lance three feet long and thumb thick armed with sharp trian-\ gular pointed steel or head of foot in length some carried slings others bows-\ the hastati and principes wore fhort coat of armour that they might be the\ fitter for march and the management of all forts of arms they had long breeches reaching half-way the legs and close at the knees and helmet and large oval\ buckler two feet and an half in the transverse and four or five feet in the conjugate\ diameter they were girt with swords on both sides that on the left much longer\ than the other which like dagger was but span long their other weapors\ were two darts or wooden staves one thia like an arrow and three cubits long breadth of the hand with pointed iron head as long as the staff and let half-\ way into the wood and beset with hooks this iron next the wood was finger\ and an half in thiknefs.\ the triarii bore the same arms as the principes except that instead of the darts they used pikes formerly carried by the hastati and from whence they took their\ name who left them for the darts the richest armed themselves with com-\ modious body-coats instead of breast-pieces the romans generally wore short\ hair with shaved chins but the hair growing on each side of their cheeks yet we must observe that scipio was the only person among them who had long\ hair the roman helmets clofing with the forehead were made either of dou-\ ble leather iron or brass and crested on top like the greeks but less sumptuous except those of the generals and other commanders which were plumed some\ also had winged helmets and on the crest snake or dragon or an eagle\'92 head.\ we\ we find likewise that the ancient romans in their marches carried saw basket spade an axe bridle fickle and provision for three days the\ herculani of the old troops and the joviniani or according to vegetius jovi-\ ani were two select roman legions consisting of six thousand men each and\ serving in selavonia to whom the emperor diocletianus who caused himself to be\ stiled jupiter and maximinianus hercules after they had gained him the imperial\ dignity gave that name in preference to all other legions for their valour these besides their large swords and oblong shields had darts the insides whereof were\ run with lead and called manorbarbuli which for their heaviness forwards swords they so galled the enemy and their horses as to gain the emperors several\ great battles.\ the roman horse wore an helmet and breast-piece like the foot had cross-\ shield by the horse\'92 side long sword on their right side javelin intheir hands and in their quivers three or more arrows broad-ironed yet sharp pointed and\ not inferior to the javelins the ensigns both of foot and horse wore lions sxins\ over their military dresses and the trumpets the same save that the two fore-\ paws of the skins were by these latter tied under their chins serving them also\ for cloaks these skins were not merely fleaed with the hair on but also sitted for\ service and underneath either fringed or elegantly cut out.\ the numidians and cretians under roman command and aiding them on horse-\ back as need required were armed with bows and arrows and also with slings wherewith they dexterously flung stones pliny writes that even the scorpio machine of war with which anciently they used to throw large stones and timbers was the invention of th\'e9 crerians.\ the ligurians who for long time valiantly kept the romans at bay were well\ disciplined soldies armed with breast-piece an helmet fhield and in close dress they were also very expert in throwing the javelin.\ the scythians barbarous people and horsemen wore crested helmets pointed\ on top they carried bows daggers and battle-axes.\ the scythian women called amazons oftentimes appeared in combat as\ vincentius says in antique silver helmets and breast-pieces because their country\ abounded with that metal but according to the ancient memoirs their military\ dresses were only adorned with serpents skins wrought in silver they had the\ left breast bare but the right which was scared that they might with greater\ ease use the bow and cast the dart covered like the rest of their bodies their\ garment buttoned below reached not quite to their knees their defence was target or large round shied cut holow at one of the extremities into the form of two\ conjoined crescents having part in the middle for covering and guarding the\ arm and hand one of these cuts served for managing the lance and the other to\ look through they likewise carried axes and hammers.\ the goths together with the great attila descended from the scythians were\ armed with bows arrows long and strong spears or lances shields and helmets.\ the horsemen full armoured and carrying strong lances hammers and clubs would leap on their horses without the help of the stirrup or other advantage es-\ pecially\ pecially on smooth ice or on snowy ground where they generally fought their\ greatest battles sometimes as need required and in the heat of battle they\ would in full gallop throw themselves on another horse turning and winding\ with incredible swiftness even catching up lance from the ground an\ evidence what great warriors these people-formerly were.\ the persians and spartans were very much alike in dress except in their head\ ornaments the former wore turbans and the latter caps like night-cap yet\ pointed on top and curling forwards or else iron head-pieces like the romans but plain and without crest they had long hair and their beards almost hid\ theirears on the other hand the persians shaved both head and face their\ vestment girt about the middle reached below the knees they wore also long\ open breeches and wide stockings and shoes they used scaled arms round\ shields greaves or shin armour scimitars hung on the right thigh crofs the body\ aud the dagger on the same side but at the girdle at their back was the\ quiver.\ darius the last king of persia was commonly arrayed in rich purple mantle\ intermixed with white stripes fastened on each shoulder with precious stones and\ before with gold chain or hook his coat of armour wrought with gold was\ embroidered on the breast with three golden eagles having spread wings and\ tails and bills turning towards each other and between the wings and tails were\ seen the following letters nikhtikstaton signifying always con-\ queror at his golden girdle girt loosely and womanisn hung scimitar the\ scabbard whereof was beset with precious stones.\ the dacians wore gowns hanging down to the heels and open on the sides and\ over them coat of mail which reached to the middle their helmets sat close\ about the head and ran up to apoint their arms were bows and arrows dag-\ ger and javelins and their horses wholly guarded except the eyes with scaled\ coverings.\ the parthians medes and assprians were guarded like the persians save that the\ parthians wore long coats of mail covering both man and horse and the assprians\ brass head-pieces.\ the phrygians and armedians used helmets short spears javelins and daggers wearing wide stockings and shoes like the persians.\ the carthaginians were as elegant and magnificent in arms as the persiuns.\ the macedonians and their neighbours differed little in their dress and arms from\ the greeks and the romans and trojans the same.\ the lacedemonians first began to carry shield sword and axe.\ the people of caria were the first who served for pay carried shields bore\ armour and had plumes or feathers on their helmets.\ the thracians wore head-pieces of fox skins coats of armour party-coloured\ dresses and stockings of skins their weapons were darts round shields and\ daggers.\ the athiopean horse wers guarded with an helmet coat of armour reaching\ half way the thighs powdered with iron eyes and proof against cuts and pushes.\ their arms were round shield lance scimitar and clubs plated with iron.\ those who had no helmets wore long and hairy or woolly red caps like the ma-\ malukes in agypt the foot to strike terror in their enemies wore fkins of lions tigers leopards and other wild beasts anil had for weapons large bows pikes arrows and slings the emperor himself wore costly silver diadem about his\ head and carried in his hand silver crucifix he was dressed in gold stuff full\ pleated over silk shirt with large ducal sleeves and from his middle hung loose garment of silk and gold stuff his body guards covering their heads\ and shoulders with beasts skins carried sword dagger and javelin.\ the indians were cloathed in wood and had bows of reeds and arrows yard\ and half long tipped with iron.\ the arabians wore girt coats and used crooked but handy bows.\ the lybians were dressed in leather and had burnt javelins.\ the agyctians bore shield and broad sword.\ the inhabitants of the baleares now majorca minorca had slings.\ the atolians lances and javelins.\ the scoitzers from ancient times were good soldiers as appears by their contests\ with julius casar used large and long shields for defence their arms were\ strong spears pikes and clubs.\ the gauls carried large shields and long swords.\ the people of the territory of abruzzo anciently called samnites were good\ horse-men and darters.\ the inhabitants of marchia anconitana anciently stiled by the romans ager\ picenus or country of wood-peckers were likewise good soldiers and bore shield pike an helmet and sword.\ thus think to have made some provision for further enquiry that artists\ may not be at loss he who wants more information can read virgil ammianas mar-\ cellinus vegetius polvbius and herodotus hallicarnassus which last in the life of\ xerxes lays down all the particulars relating to each people and all sorts of bar-\ barians vitrueius also has written treatise of the roman military exercife.\ homer in his lliad speaking offights wherein some had gold brafs and steel ar-\ mour says ee he pussied him in the belly but pierced not his armour'\ and in\ another passage ee he dealt him such blowon his steel-breast as to make it strike\ sire and resound now ifit be afked what sort of armour this must have been of massy gold and other metal and whether it could be possible for any person\ to move bend and turn in such armour as shewed the muscles and limbs sat\ close to the body answer they could not and that the notion of their having\ been thus is wrong think those are also out of the way who suppose they are so\ represented for the sake of decorum and that this is reason enough without con-\ sidering whether it be posfible or not since other reasons may be assigned which\ can give better satisfaction without forcing nature for my part believe that\ the arms and their use were anciently as now and the coats of armour were like\ our buff coats made of leather they may possibly have been so contrived as to\ shew\ shew the muscling but granting it they must be much sitter for use than if of\ steel or solid gold wherefore can not but think they were made of leather and of all sorts of colours wrought or embroidered with silver or gold even\ covered over with gold like our gilt leather and set off with scales foilage and\ other such ornaments remember to have read in my youth in certain\ ancient latin treatise yet extant dedicated to the emperors theodosius and valenti-\ nian and entitled eethe great number of the roman forces \'92\'92 that the roman ar-\ mours breast-pieces or military coats as there called were lined with wool and covered with the skins of wolves lions and other wild beasts of libva ne-\ vertheless to support the opinion of the poets add that they had gold brass and\ steel breast and belly-pieces fastened with small hooks and buckles on the shoulders\ and sides to ward off blows but they were plain without muscling and not put on\ but in times of preparation for battle wherefore they are much to blame who\ introduce such accoutrements on every occasion as for instance scipio in his tent\ with the young bride and sitting in full armour or alexander with roxana rinal-\ do courting armida and other such occurrences.\ chap viii of the origin of the several ensigns and shields and\ their devices for distinction of nations and particular persons.\ ttbeing in painting absolutely necessary first to distinguish the nations and\ next the personages among them of high and lesser degree by tokens either\ devised by themselves or appropriated by others think proper to handle this\ point largely in order to shew the greatness of the roman power and the many\ foreign troops entertained in their service say both painters and statuaries es-\ pecially the latter ought to be acquainted with these things that in representing\ either particular nation or hero they may on their shields exhibit the proper\ badges of dictinction whereby to be presently known by persons conversant in an-\ tiquities this knowledge is as necessary for history painters since histories fre-\ quently make mention of congrefs of several nations and their heroes in one\ place without describing their arms and banners point which cost me\ much trouble to gain but proved of greater advantage in the uses made\ thereof and which introduce here as having some relation to the preceding\ chapter.\ on consulting histories find the ancients instead of banners made use of bundle of arrows or boughs and greens tied together which they called mani-\ pulus or an handful and the ensign bearers manipularii titus livius the\ nice roman historian and antiquary tells us that romulus having by accident ap-\ peased tumult with few people from that time represented it in the ensigns and\ arms by wisp of hay causing this token as an happy one to be born be-\ fore him in the ensuing wars the romans afterwards painted on their ensigns\ and\ anc standards simall red flames in token of suecess az in the battle with the sa-\ bines near eretum where the arms of the former appeared by night as if on fire without being damaged thus the standards and ensigns of the legions by the\ sight whereof the soldiers knew the wills of their generals were from.time to time\ augmented they had also at different times divers other tokens as open right\ hands the image of their emperors insilver or gold or gilt and sometimes there\ hung under them small pendant having the general or peoples motto qr they likewise bore in their banners the representation of\ wolves minotaurs wild boars horses bulls and dragons till at last they fix-\ ed on the eagle for the chief field standard the romans used the wolf minotaur wild boar horse bull and dragon for the following reasons the wolf partly\ as he was sacred to mars the god of war and partly because his penetratron is\ so gre\'e2t that he can see as well by night as by day whereby they meant that prudent general ought always to be on his guard so as not to be surprised by\ the stratagems of the enemy by the minotaur says vegetius they signified that\ as this beast kept himself in the most hidden part of the labyrinth so the designs\ of general ought to be kept secret the wild boar because no peace or cessa-\ tion of arms was made without it vide our gth book page treating\ of the offerings the horse as being of great account among the romans and the\ proper sign of war th\'e9 bull because the ancient romans pretended that the\ word italia was derived from stala which now -- days signifies calf or bull the\ dragon they commonly painted on the baniiers of the foot and each century had\ one whence the bearer of it aceording to vegetias was called dragonarius am\'ac\ mianus mercellinus tells us the manner of carrying it ee they tied says he to\ the tops of their gilt pikes which were gold fringed and beset with- peapls- and\ precious ftones dragons made of woven stuff and hollow within which on\ being advanced in the air opened their frightful mouths and made grumbling\ noise as if full of wrath and fury bending and moving their tails-with the wind.\ of which claudianus speaks ee et cessante vento multi taucere dracones the\ dragons were all sileat when the wind abated this enfign according to ammi\'ac\ anus aforesaid was of reddishi purple the eagle surpaffing all other birds in\ courage and boldness is not improperly called the roman eagle for to what cor-\ ner of the known world has he not extended the roman dominion- what resisting\ nation has not felt the effect of their deliberations and the valour wherewith\ they put them in execution and yet know from history that the eagle was in\ use long before among the persians for crus the founder of that monarchy bore\ according to- xenophon golden eagle with- spread wings on long pike as if he\ would sly over the universe which custom his sucessors retained as royal token by\ consent of the soothsayers all nations anciently ascribed- to this bird the honour of\ belie ving he prognosticated good luck and happy success in any undertakings in\ which sense justinus tells us that hiero when young who was of mean birth on his\ mother\'92 side making his first campaign an eagle flew down and sat on his shield which was judged as presage of his becoming in time an excellent general\'92and king as afterwards came to pass the poets even say that-this bird implies prosperity\ assigned\ assigned to any person by divine providence this opinioh bwes its rise to the\ relation of anacreon the first writer of antiquities that jupiter intending to de-\ stroy the giants who threatened t\'e9 storm heaven the powers of which he offered\ to was by the aecidental flight of an eagle asfured of an happy and fuccefsful\ victory which afterwards obtaining he always bore golden eagle in his arms and\ banners as \'e0 perpetual memorial thereef from jupiter the getians asfumed that\ bird and from them the candiots aneas the trojan introduced him among the latines\ and from them the romans in process of time cam\'e9 to use him for their arms though\ lipsius is of opinion they assumed him after the example of the perfians the\ juscans beaten by the romans in their last conflict near the city of eretum on the\ borders of the sabines presented tarquinius priscas king of the romans their\ king\'92 regalia to wit gold crown purple garment and mantie of various\ colours also an ivory chair and an ivory sceptre with an eagle on top which he\ and his fuccessors always bore after the banishment of the kings the senate\ took the eagle from their sceptres and set them on their pikes exalting him\ above all their other arms whether the wolf minotaur horse wild boar .\ marius when child happening to find an eagle\'92 nest with seven young pre-\ sage of his two consulats often placed the said number in his arms and in his\ second consulat asfigned the eagle to the roman legions using him only in battles\ in order to spirit the soldiers and asfure them of victory the other military\ tokens were set on the tents but marius took them down and from that time\ no legion was without two eagles but josephus in his fourth book gives\ each legion one eagle and by the number of eagles they counted their legions as hirtius says that pompey\'92 army conssisted of thirteen eagles dion also affigns\ each legion an eagle this eagle stood with extended wings on pilum or staff which according to vegetius was sive feet and half in length armed with sharp\ triangular iron of nine ounces the bearers of it they called aquilifere thefe\ eagles were but small and of silver and many had the thunder in their talons.\ the romans first used silver eagles as did also brutus because silver is the\ brightest metal and most like the day and therefore most properest for military\ token but afterwards they made them of gold as more stately and surpassing\ the silver the romnns first used silver tokens as being originally frugal and\ saving but at length they yielded to none even not to the persians in luxury\ pomp and shew julius caesar so highly prized the batavians in ronian pay that he made them\ his body-guards intrusting them likewise in the sharpest engagements with the\ carriage of the first and chief standards of the roman eagles.\ the herculeans of the old troops mentioned in the preceding chapter bare\ on their ensign blue eagle with spread wings in silver field cornered with\ gold.\ the young herculeans carried in th eir standards golden eagle sitting on stem of tree in blue field bordered with gold.\ the new jovinians had in their enfigns golden eagle with diadem or royal\ fillet about the head this \'e9agle was either black or brown in gold field and\ the wings werelset off with red and blue and had small gold-shield on his breast-\ but\ but those of the old troops carried purple eagle adorned with red and gold in\ blue field.\ the legions called quartodecimani stationed in thracia for the defence of these\ countries bare pale blue eagle sitting on globe of bright and deep\ blue in silver field bordered and centered with gold.\ the divitenses legion of the gauls carried an eagle of faint scarlet and golden bull in silver field.\ the banner of the first company of life guards of the emperor theodosius com-\ manded by colonel of the foot had the figure of an half man with extended\ arms holding in the right hand rope and in the left an hat thereby inti-\ mating that the stubborn and rebellious should be chastised and the obedient\ made free.\ in the second banner was golden bull on the jut of red hill with moor\ or black down to the middle holding piece of thick rope in the right hand and cap or hat in the left shewing that they might make prisoners and slaves and set men at liberty.\ the thracians carried the idol mars in their standards.\ the people of smyrna the image of fortune and the corinthians neptune or the horse pegafus.\ the regiment called the old argivi of the east commanded by the general\ of the foot had two leaping horses of gold in blue field.\ the regiment of foot called the second of theodosus first established in his\ reign carried in its ensigns golden horse in red field bordered with\ gold.\ another foot legion set up in the emperor constaus\'92 time whence it was called\ constantia had also golden horse in sky blue field and above him in the\ middle red globe against which he was rearing and throwing himself out\ with all his might.\ the athenians cephalenians thessalians and syracusans also carried an horse.\ the gauls and saxons had lion and the latter sometines an horse.\ the cimbrians bare bull whose figure cast they likewise carried on lance at\ the head of their armies.\ the armenians carried ram or crowned lion.\ the cissians had also lion.\ the asiatics large whale guided by child sitting astride on his\ back and the goihs she-bear.\ the banner of the salii had two half wolves rearing up against each other and\ fixing their eyes on rose which was over their heads in gold field bordered with\ purple it is no wonder these people blazoned the wolf seeing they claimed mars\ as their protector.\ the regiment of foot cahled jovianum which had the fifth post of honour\ among the romans bare in the emperor diocletianus\'92 time red hog sitting up-\ right on its hinder parts in blue field bordered with gold and for this reason the\ the poets have feigned that jupiter when achild and lying in the wood was nursed\ by sow and this regiment having the name of jupiter it therefore carried the\ hog in its standards in memory of that occurrence.\ the foot regiment of guards established by the emperor honorius bare two\ demi-red hogs rearing against each other in silver shield and gold field.\ the trojans likewise carried an hog in gold field.\ phrygians had also an hog.\ the regiment called tertiodecimani had leaping blue dog in silver field\ centered with gold and bordered with dark blue.\ from the time of constantine the great down to those of theodosius honorius and several successive emperors the romans had foot regiment called menapii whose device was leaping red dog in silver field centred with small gold\ shield and under it another dog lying on his back and flinging up his legs this.\ bodv was in high esteem for the honour it gained in vanquifhing the thracians.\ the cynopolitans bare anubis in the fhape of dog.\ the cortonenses devised silver dragon in red field on the sides were two\ rings that on the left of avery deep red and the other of silver.\ the lacedemonians had the greek letter or dragon.\ the indians bare the image of hercules but their horse according to suidas carried dragons.\ the nervii being the body-bowmen\ of the emperors had for device two\ demi-caducei or wands twined with serpents in purple field bordered with gold\ and red in the centre of the shield was gold ring on sinall gold column round which the afore said serpents winding their upper parts making semi-cir-\ cle and their heads regarding each other.\ the saguntiuns had for device two red ferpents and as ammianus says of purple crossing each other like the greek letter in fky-blue field bordered with\ red.\ the company of bienians serving under the general of the foot in sclavonia bare in their banners deep blue serpent with bent tail towards the ground with man\'92 head looking backwards in blue silver-like sield bordered with\ gold.\ the marcomani had gold demi-serpent in silver field and between the\ fiead and the under part was gold half moon.\ the curians bare gold serpent coiled up in grey field bordered with silver\ and blue checkers.\ the legion of foot called the sixth parthian serving in the east had for de-\ vice yellow caduceus or mercury\'92 wand in blue hield edged with purple and\ silver.\ the legion of the angrivarii carried red staff topped with round ball out of\ which issued two serpents bending to the middle of the shield as if kissing each-\ other in pale blue field with double edging of purple and gold.\ among the ancient legions was regiment called valentiani establishied by the\ emperor valens on his waging war with the thracians these carried in their stan-\ dards\ dards small red column and two half-moons of the-same colour over two gol-\ den hares jumping against each other in silver field.\ the libyans had three hares.\ the ensign of the roman legion called augusta was an exact red cat set off\ with gold in silver field and turning her head side-ways as if going backwards.\ the apini had blue cat walking upright in crimson field set off with\ gold.\ the ancient alani bugundiones and suevi also carried cat thereby intima-\ ting that they could bear the yoke of servitude with as little stomach as the cat\ cared to be locked up.\ the agyptians carried crocodile or else cat.\ not long before the decay of the roman monarchy they had legion in pay called cornuti whose device was red falcon in gold field set off with blue and\ red.\ the inhabitants of peloponnesas bare tortoise.\ the baotians sphinx.\ the loerenses locust and\ the aslyrians in memory of semirami dove.\ the arcadians who set up for tbe most ancient people in the world and to\ be co-aval with the moon therefore carried the moon in their ensigns and\ sometimes the god pan who is the emblem of the whole earth.\ the parthians had broad sword or scimitar in the hand of winged arm.\ the greeks commonly had two crowns.\ the medes three crowns.\ the macedonians hercules\'92 club between two horns.\ the cappadocians cup.\ the soythians thunder andt\ the phanicians sun and moon.\ the ensign of the foot called braccati juniores an illustrious title among the\ ancient romans was of dark blue colour having star with eight points in\ the upper part and in the middle circle embellished with gold.\ the tr\'e6zenenses bare trident.\ the imperial standard of the emperor theodosius had crofs in which sign he\ put all his confidence.\ constantine in the battie with maxentius had for his banner long staff\ having on top crofs-piece both plated with gold and above crown beset\ with precious stones on which were engraved the two first letters of the name of\ christ in greek to wit \'e0 in the middle of an name he likewise bore on\ his helmet to the aforesaid crofs-piece hung pendant embroidered with gold\ and pearls under the aforefaid name and the standard of the cross he obtained\ glorious victory over the tyrant maxentins.\ lucianus writes that the pentagon is the emblem of an happy enterprize and\ good success proceeding from the following consideration antiochus the first sirnamed soier saviour waging war with the galatians and perceiving by\ the daily increase of new dangers and difficulties that the issue would not be so\ prosperous\ prosperous as he could wissi dreamed or so pretended in order to spirit his sol-\ diers that he had conversation with alexander the great who advised him to take\ for his emblem the common word of falutation in greek treia or wifhi you\ health and prosperity and to give it to his commanders and soldiers for the ge-\ neral watch-word and have it carried on their arms shields and banners as be-\ ing to ferve him for token of victory whereupon he described to them the\ fffape of this emblem which was three triangles drawn through each other with\ five lines constituting quintangular figure and on each angle one of the said\ letters antiochus having done this obtained flgnal victory over the galatians.\ there are still extant several coins and medals of antiochus bearing the said pen\'ac\ tagon or quintangular figure.\ the argonauts or thofe of argos had the letter ain their ensign as being their\ mitial letter yet they bare likewise afox or rat.\ the jews had the letter the token of salvation.\ the painted and engraved shields in-reference to which many of the learned\ would derive the latin word stutum shield from sculptura because it was cus-\ tomary to engrave or reprefent glorious actions and histories upon them were\ anciently certain sign of the valour of those who carried them and lest the sol-\ diers in the heat of battle fhould mistake their comrades each legion according\ to vegetius had particular marks on their fhields and on the infide of which was\ written cach soldier\'92 name and what company he belonged to.\ the shields or targets were of different makes at the place where they guarded\ the hand as those of the first armenian order had two indentures cut out down the\ fides as we have said in the for\'e9going chapter touching the shields of the ama-\ zons these shields were of fky-blue colour with silver field those of the\ second armenian order were quite round of purple colour with sky-blue field bordered with gold.\ the vesontians bare shields with four small ones at the angles making square two whereof were of silver and the others of sky-blue double bordered.\ the fhield of the menapii had silver field with gold dog in full speed as if\ running to the outside.\ the mantineans bare in their arms and shiields the trident as sign according\ pindarus of their being citizens of that town.\ the romans after adrian\'92-time carried in their crescen-tlike shields in silver\ fleld two gold demi-horses curvetting against against each other and called\ mauriferoces or stout and fearleis whereby some alude to italy.\ the spartans bare dragon.\ the gree\'e8s the god neptune.\ the trojans minerva.\ the lacedemonians carried the greek letter for their signification and\ the messenians formerly an excellent and valiant people an for the same\ reason.\ the athenians often bare an owl in their arms.\ the\ the jecos affirm they were the first who made distinction between people of\ high and low degree by particular tokens accordingly those who were of emi-\ nent or noble families wore in their shoes waxing moon.\ the assprians egyptians persians and greeksfor that reason used the same token whence it is probable the turks in process of time took it for their standard.\ the romans likewise in token of nobility wore waxing moon on their shoes which therefore they called lunulati calceei.\ the athenians expressed the antiquity of their descent by grafshopper as\ thucydides relates in the beginning of his history stiling them porticigal\'e6 from\ their custom of wearing gold grasshoppers in their head-ornaments and their ge-\ nerals the same on their helmets for distinction between the foreign and native\ ancient writers assure us that most heroes bare some device or other on their\ shields some of which shall here set down without regard to dignity or pri-\ ority of time wherein they lived.\ ofiris sirnamed janus bare in his ensign sceptre topped with an eye and\ sometimes with the addition of an eagle the sun or such like object and lsis\ carried moon.\ hercules called by some the great ofiris bare lion with battle-ax in his\ paws or else the seven headed serpent hydra.\ mars had wolf and on his helmet magpye.\

emblem touching flowers.\ youthfal flora sits here attired in blue tellow and red attended by foar\ children representing the four seasons each dressed in garment or\ drapery of the coulour peculiar to him and dancing with flowers and\ fruits which they present to her.\ chap of flowers in general.\ xxx\ the spring being the most delightful seafon of the year it is no\ wonder that flowers have particular charm above other ob-\ jects and this not only in nature but also in painting which\ though ever so indifferent lovers often prefer before fine piece of\ hiftory or landscape.\ it is remarkable that amidst the various choices in the art of painting none is\ more feminine or proper for women than this and the reason is plain itis\ also to be noted that of those choices one is as- perfect as the other with respect to\ art were it ever so singular and though this choice is but small part of the whole yet\ yet it is attended with as many excellencies for as bunch of grapes carries its per-\ fection so the least grain does the fame but though both the parts as well as the\ whole fall under the fame rules and one master understand his branch as well as the\ ocher yet he who has from his youth applied himself to this or that single choice let\ has progrefs therein be what it will can perform nothing else that is good we have\ many instances of excellent mafters who departed from the general to particular\ choices with applause but of none who have done the contrary without discredit reckon discredit as bad an exchange as copper for gold or water for wine of the for-\ mer fort are innumerable italian and french as well as looo duich masters but of the\ latter few among whom vereist alone claims the laurel to the wonder of those who\ knew him when he painted flowers for if ever painter excelled in that branch he\ was the person neither mario da fiori father segers or de heem came up to such\ pitch and yet through bad exchange he at last fell from an agreeable spring\ sons first in confirmation of my asfertion that he who can perform the most difficult\ things may easily even without trouble attain those of less consideration but\ not the contrary without disadvantage and discredit secondly because my de-\ sign is to treat of flowers as an effectual admonition to those who would bestow\ their time with advantage on that single choice.\ flower painting is certainly commendable study but as there are double and single slowers so there are two forts of flower painters the one singular and simple\ and the other rich and ingenious of which latter sort we have but few and\ of the former abundance three things are especially necessary in good flower-\ piece first choice and beautiful flowers secondly good disposition and harmo-\ ny and lastly neat and soft penciling first the flowers must not be poor or\ lying or standing they always keep their proper quality and shape that\ the round seem not by too extravagant spread to be triangular square or ob-\ long whereby to mistake one flower for another that the most noble and beau-\ tiful have the predominancy and that by their placing they produce an agree-\ able mixture of coulours delighting and satisfying the eye consisting in so\ ordering the strong and striped with the faint ones as to exhibit lovely rain-\ bow lastly that each flower be well expressed according to its nature and\ quality as one thin another thick this soft and limber that set and stiff one\ shining another dull and glossless.\ we are in the next place to suppose that it is impossible to be master\ without firm and exact draught and thorough acquaintance with perspective to-\ gether with good knowledge of the colours and their bodies and which will\ stand best and lastly due enquiry into the nature of slowers that they may\ be handled accordingly.\ he who would follow this study in good earnest ought to be master of flow-\ er garden which he should carefully cultivate that he may in the seasons be\ furnished with sine and choice flowers for though modelling be great affist-\ ance in winter practice when \'92the life is not to be had yet no perfection at -- he who is afirm and nimble draughtsman and good\ tainable without the life.\ manager of water colours has double advantage and may in time get treafure\ of beautiful modelled flowers bearing good prices and great esteem among the\ curious after the flowers the green leafing of them is of great importance through its various qualities and difference in texture and colour causing flow-\ er piece to look natural and more decorous.\ chap ii of painting flowers in halls apartments galleries but principally on cielings for ornament.\ is the business of good flower painter principally to aim at what is praise-\ worthy what great things what glorious occasions is there for master\'92\ famel but this lies not always in the representations of garlands of slowers pots glafs-bottles butterflies flying beetles cobwebs or drops of water any more than in neat penciling and bright colours with which we think to\ set the world in gaze such trifles are too low and the repetition too irksome for the taste of noble fouls what opportunities do not daily happen in palaces gardens galleries and apartments for shewing our skill and ingenuity suppose\ to yourself lofty room built with white marble and set out with fine pictures\ and bass-reliefs for the common recreation of young gentlemen and ladies this room may be embellished above and on each side of the niches with fine\ and large festoons of flowers between the pilasters and over the bass-reliefs\ much green yet somewhat lefs in case any landscapes be there and on the\ white marble may be all sorts of beautiful coloured flowers on red marble con-\ trarily white and yellow ones according to the rules of art and in large\ parts now light then again dark leafing as the matter and ground require.\ but of the several grounds and colours of flowers suitable to them we shall here-\ after treat particularly on the cieling there may be thin branches of airy foil-\ age also intermixed with slowers here festoon-ways there in groups sastened\ with ribbons or rings and having in some places loose sprigs and leaves project-\ ing from the ground and returning their proper shades thereon which though\ the life is not to be had may by some such made things be performed that\ they may seem more naturaly to hang off such flowers and leaves ought to\ be strongly and boldly handled but yet so as to seem fastened to the work well\ considering the colour and lightnefs or darkness of the ground and chusing for it\ flowers of such colours that some may look as if sticking to it and others\ coming off now if many festoons be to hang in such place or room they\ must needs have like length breadth and fullness and be placed equally\ high or low what difference is it to us whether the proprietor desire to have\ slowers or fruits or mixture of botht for the festoons may be filled with\ peaches peaches apricots mulberries plumbs hanging on their twigs over the\ representation of bacchanal some bunches of white and blue grapes intermix-\ ed with pine-apples look becoming on the alcove may hang loosely over it\ papavers of all sorts of colours interspersed with poppies tied here and there\ with ribbons as most proper for that place.\ why should not such sorts of ornament be agreeable when naturally dis-\ posed and painted especially if well lighted and the ground shades duly expres-\ sed on the ground the company before-mentioned may possibly raise mirth\ enough among themselves but so pleasant sight must needs be great\ addition to it let us therefore take hold of every opportunity that offers and\ in the mean time exercise our talents in the attainment of great handling let\ us exchange our small cloaths for whole walls our pots and bottles for vases and mudling for beautiful manner let us enquire what flowers are painter-\ like and which the principal conjoining their sense application and colour\ together with their proper grounds.\ chap iii that flower-painter should understand perspective also the mistake of representing things improperly.\ te have already asferted that good flower painter must needs under-\ stand perspective and yet which is to be lamented few know any\ thing of it possibly supposing they have no occasion for it and that therefore\ this branch is so much easier than history or any thing else which can not sub-\ sist without perspective as indisputably requiring more by-works viz archi-\ tecture landscape or other object causing ground shades which never hrppen in\ their work\'92 and should they at any time be non-plus\'92 they can get help from those\ who are acquainted with perspective if therefore they have but point of sight they think that sufficient and yet not for the sake of the flowers but solely for the\ corner of marble table or slab whereon they set flower glass as if the light-\ ing or shading of the flowers were matter of indifference this from -side that\ fronting one from below another from above whence their pieces have usually\ many points of sight sometimes as many as there are flowers but it can not be\ otherwise since they often paint after models placing slower on the left side which stood before on the right and the contrary or else below or above which\ they imagine no-body will discover because they can not see it themselves.\ another ridiculous custom of some flower painters in my opinion is that in\ painting any glossy bodies such as flower glasses gold silver or copper vases after the life they fail not to shew therein the panes of the windows and after-\ wards to hang the pictures in halls and galleries which have none here let\ me take notice of an extraordinary nice and finished piece of that nature paint-\ ed by certain known gentlewoman wherein not only some stalks of the slow-\ ers\ ers appeared naturally through the glafs but afso her own picture in her posture\ of painting with such an air as evidently shewed it was she who sat in it nor\ did she forget to represent also the windows and panes sky and clouds we need\ not question whether she endeavoured by the depth of her penetration to sur-\ pass her master in that piece of work this case is -kin to that of certain\ young artist who painting looking glass fronting brought into it all that ap-\ peared behind him people could not be persuaded it was looking-glafs though\ painted dark and dull and it had frame about it and his protestations that\ every thing was taken from the life stood him in little stead wherefore to salve\ the matter as he thought he painted himself in the looking-glass sitting at his\ easel and to make it more perfect underwrit ee this is looking glass and\ that is-me.\ ch ap iv of flowers on all sorts of grounds.\ hat white is set off by black and the contrary needs no demonstration and on the other hand white on white and black on black causes sticking together of which particular notice ought to be taken that slowers\ may have their due force and effect so ordering them that some seem to stick\ to the ground and others to come off from it the most proper grounds for\ flowers are these.\ the colour of blue tomb-stone-\ dark-olive or green serpentine.\ light-grey freestone.\ white marble but of second tint.\ this observation would rather spoil good ordonnance than have the desired\ effect if we did not maturely weigh what uses we would put thefe grounds to as also where the flowers most properly ought to have the greatest strength and\ where the greatest weakness in order that the principal mean the fixed stone\ and wood work may not thereby be overpowered say strengh with respect to\ force and beauty but mean not by weakness that the colour light or shade\ should be weakened or sullied however shall in the sequel explain what mean\ by that word.\ any colour suits on white but the darkest most beautifully warm colours\ are preferable to the broken ones and the most weak ought to be on the extre-\ mities but sew white ones and those with caution what now say concerns\ the disposition which shall more plainly handle in treating of festoons and\ groaps of flowers.\ the black grounds though quite different from the preceding with respect\ to great force can give little reffexion and therefore do not admit of light or\ weak slowers but neverthelefs fall under the same rules and observations as flow-\ ers on white ground because the greens by their union have relation to the\ ground and colour.\ red and yellow suit not but with dark grounds.\ all flowers and greens look well on grey ground.\ all weak flowers as violet light purple blue apple-blossom and white agree with warm ground.\ flowers have particular decorum on gold or silver ground and still\ greater on copper or bronze by reason of their darkish lustre since the colour of\ gold is too strong and that of silver too pale.\ chap of the disposition of flowers and their colours in\ festoons and groups.\ yyaving hitherto treated of flowers in general we shall now prooed to\ their disposition in groups and festoons.\ shall compose each group of particular emblematic colours as-yellow red purple violet blue and white which consider as follows.\ the first group yellow having for its principal flower turnsol african or\ marigold anemone which stile upper power or eternity.\ the second red as peonies papavers roses signifying power or might the third purple flowers roles papavers tulips implying nobility.\ the fourth violet as fritillaria or fritillary signifying inconstancy.\ the fifth blue as iris convolvolus or bind-weed implying constancy.\ the sixth white as the lilly or white rose signifying purity.\ it must be observed that though in these groups the capital flowers be of particular colour yet they will admit of other small ones about them of vari-\ ous eolours suiting therewith as with the yellow purple violet and blue.\ red light-yellow apple-blossom dark blue and white-\ purple white yellow and light blue.\ violet fose-colour orange light red and afh-blue.\ blue purple orange light yellow and white.\ two capital colours as deep yellow vermilion or blue must never be placed\ or upon one another.\ by\ white suits any where except on deep yellow or deep red.\ dark green agrees with all light flowers and pale green with dark flowers.\ under these groups there should always be either motto or verse.\ as for festoons they may be handled in the same manner yet with less con-\ finement if the emblematic colour have but the middle place that is sufficient the other parts may be filled up with such colours as we please provided they\ have somewhat less brightness than the principal for instance let the mid-\ die\ die flowers be large and high coloured as africans or marigolds yellow and\ red on the right side may be purple as rofest anemones and on the left blue as iris flos principius hyacinths the purple side mixed with little white and\ less yellow the blue side with yellow and red and the yellow in the middle with violet dark blue little purple and white.\ in second festoon white may possess the middle place as white roses lillies\ and others on the right side may be yellow and on the left pale red the yel-\ low may be diversified with purple violet and dark blue the red with pale yel-\ low white violet and dark blue and the white in the middle with rose colour violet purple and beauriful red.\ in the middle of athird festoon may be red as papavers anemones on\ the right side striped flowers of purple and yellow violet and pale yellow di-\ versisied with dark blue and beautiful red but on the other side all plain\ flowers.\ the white may be intermixed with slowers of any colour except light yellow.\ the intermixture consists of small flowers but the single coloured whether in\ the middle or largest as also those on the sides require their particular small di-\ versifying flowers the single coloured with speckled or striped and the\ -contrary.\ if either group or festoon full or close flowers should always be placed in the\ most relieved part the open ones are mostly set on the sides in order to create\ shade for instance let the middle part of festoon have the largest finest and\ fullest slowers such as red and white roses papavers between the middle\ and the extremities lesser sort as tulips anemones narcissuses or daffodils gilli-flowers malva rosea further towards the extremities the more long\ and smaller ones as astragalus ranunculus or crow-foot convolvolus flos\ principis borage barbatum nigri violets .\ on the relief of the festoon between the largest and middle fort may be mixture of the smallest flowers if the middle flower be yellow those further off\ ought to be purple or red and such as are towards the corners white and blue the longer the weaker that the strongest colour may keep the middle but if\ white have the middle place the other parts must not eclipse it with yellow and\ red.\ complete festoon must have an orderly disposition not only with respect to\ the flowers themselves whether large or small but also in the placing of double\ and single ones as first white roses and centifoliae next single roses and lastly\ wild blossoms.\ as for the colours there are single and half coloured flowers the single co-\ loured are peonies rofes and the others striped or speckled with two or\ more colours as anemones with white and red striped roses tulips which\ ought to be so regularly ordered as to raise in the eye balancing mixture and\ to unite the strong and weak that the one do not project too much and the other\ too little and that at distance and at one view the festoon may have its due\ sway yet if here or there it be either too weak or too strong you must recol-\ lect\ wherefore observe that yellow and red are strong\ lect how it may be thelped.\ colours and contrarily blue and violet weak if too much yellow and red\ come together place somewhat blue or violet between and if too much blue or\ violet some yellow or red.\ to begin festoon well you ought first to mark out its course as you will have\ it either thick or thin next lay on the green with such leafing as you think\ proper but somewhat large and with due light and shade according to its light being dry lay in the flowers flat first the principal each in its place with single colour red blue or yellow of such atint as will best admit of painting\ upon it the light and shade after the life\'92 or models the flowers between with\ their leafing are put in over the green on finishing the grounds whether plain\ or in bass relief or other ornament ought to be neatly finished with the first green to save you the trouble afterwards of paring away something here and there.\ chap vi continuntion of the ordering and placing the flowers..\ ry-wo observations ef consequence in festoon group or garland still\ r\'e9main to wit the ordering the flowers and their places of hanging.\ jt is easy to conceive that many small things coming together produce at distance only confused mafs and little affect the senses as having nothing in\ them to make any impression or is worth remark and though each flower have\ it is particular name shape and colour yet they are only considered in general under the name of flowers because of their being placed either too high or too\ distant such festoons or groups look well on paper and in hand or on tea-tables toilets and the like either in painting or needle-work on the other hand large\ flowers may be seen distinctly at distance in their qualities shapes and beauties.\ then each flower gets name this is rose that papaver in word festoons groups or garlands placed high or to be viewed at some distance ought to be disposed in great maffes and separate with few speckled or striped\ flowers either large or small as having no effect-but when seen near where-\ fore it is necessary to take in their steads others of single colours in order to set\ off the work with more force and distinction and to give the eye satisfaction.\ for this reason when\'92seen in hand they ought to unite and out of hand to\ look more seperate and distinct but shall explain this by some examples chusing two groups one agreeably uniting so as to be viewed near and the other\ the contrary.\ in the middle of the former is white rose and behind it centifolia behind\ which is purple and behind that peony now these four colours differ but\ half tint from each other composing together an half ball gradually rounding.\ the latter contrarily though having also white flower in the middle has be\'ac\ hind it purple one and behind that dark violet colour darker than that of\ the peony and these will create greater force than the former as starting\ more suddenly from each other and differing whole tint as the others did but\ an half-one whence it is evident that the more distinct the tints are the more\ lively and strong they will appear.\ for further satisfaction ishall subjoin five other examples of festoons as full\ again as those in the preceding chapter since they sometimes happen to be of\ different sizes and therefore requiring more flowers divide them thus.\ th\'e9 first.\ in the middle yellow next white then purple or violet and lastly yellow.\ the other side the same.\ the second.\ in the middle white next yellow further blue and the last yellowisn white.\ the other side the same.\ the third.\ in the middle red next blue then yellow and lastly violet the other side\ the fame.\ the fourth.\ then blue and lastly light red.\ in the middle purple next pale\ other side the same.\ the fisth.\ in the middle violet next orange and other yellow then blue red and violet.\ the same on the other side.\ the three last ought to be intermixed with white and the two first with variety\ of colours as it best suits in order to- unite the parts with each other.\ three sorts of flowers are proper for intermixture vizi yellow red and blue all in their greatest beauty.\ if the work consist mostly of red and yellow it'ought to be intermixed with\ blue and if of blue you must take yellow but if of all three you are to use\ white so distributing it as to refresh the eye now for proof of all that has be\'ebn faid shall shew here two methods of\ great use to flower painter though they may seem trifling.\ painting all sorts of flowers on cards or pasteboard as rude as you please even\ but single spot for each and five or six of each colour or as many as there are\ tints tints red blue purple yellow violet let these be capital flowers.\ make smaller ones for intermixture of red blue yellow and white as beautiful\ as possible cut all these afunder and lay each colour orderly by itself in little\ box then paint up green festoon or group on pasteboard and thereon place\ such flowers as you please shifting and changing them according to your design.\ and thus you will perceive the truth of what has been before spoken.\ the other method is this take \'e0 parcel of slowers of all sorts made of paper\ or filk and with wired stalks as they are sold by the tire-women now if you\ would make group festoon or basket of flowers or any such thing order and\ shift those flowers by and upon one another as.- they suit best and thus you may\ exercise yourself in winter time when you can not have the life because those\ flowers never wither green festoons may also be furnished after the same man-\ ner and flowers hung on them according to your desire.\ of engraving.\ since neither caesar ripa nor any other author gives us the figure of the art\ of engraving with its signification shall here make it preliminary and in the sequel shew what respect is- due to this art by its reflexions\ and even relating properties with that of painting.\ chap .\ his beautiful virgin sitting at table has before her copper-plate\ lying on sand-bag and near it stands little monkey placing lighted lamp before her she is attended by prudence\ and dili-\ gence and practice is setting the tools on

etchers and engravers as marc antony audran edelinck vander meulen and\ several other ltalian and french as well as duich and german masters in the off-\ scape europe asia and africa appear standing in surprise at the sound of the\ trumpet.\ chap ii of the art of engraving in general.\ that may treat of this art in methodical manner think proper to ob-\ serve flrst wherein its excellence consists secondly its performance and lastly the qualifications of an etcher and engraver.\ the art of engraving is questionless noble and praise-worthy because it re-\ spects painting as painting does nature for as the latter has nature for its mo-\ del or object which it faithfully imitates with the pencil so engraving likewise\ copies painting either with the needle or graver in such manner as only to stand\ in need of colours- which when required may be added to it painting con-\ sists in neat and good outline proportion light and snade and these are also\ the foundations of engraving painting distinguisnes between common light and\ sunshine engraving does or can do the sanie in fine whatever the one per-\ forms with the pencil the other can express with the needle or graver and as\ neatly whether sluffs of all kinds wool silk sattin linen glass water gold wood stone .\ its performances are to the sight what fame is to the ear painting has but\ one original but engraving hundreds fame can tell the many wonders of paint-\ ing in its absence but engraving makes itself every where present slying over\ the universe as well as the sounding trumpet of fame it keeps an eternal re-\ gister of every thing that is praise-worthy and as the intire welfare even happi-\ ness or unhappiness of good painter depends on the certainty or uncertainty of\ the engraver as ishall shewin my remarks on prints after paintings or designs\ so the latter ought to disengage himself from prejudice and inclination to this or\ that particular manner and exert his sxill in an exact imitation of what he is to\ engrave or etch after any manner or any master be it flat or rising dark or light without addition or diminution except with the licence of the painter or designer.\ his work must be like clear looking-glass which exhibits all objects true and\ without falsity as to the manual operation fine handling is great step to\ grace and in order to it the knowledge of three things is absolutely necessary to wit the art of drawing perspective and the doctrine of light and shade these as principals compose the theory of the whole work he ought also to be\ very diligent in hatching with the pen or red chalk in order thereby to get firm\ handling and it behoves him as well as the painter to draw after the naked life\ and dressed laymen he should likewise be furnished with prints both engraved\ and etched of the most famous masters.\ ch ap iii of the general elegance requisite in good print and\ of the difference between book and other prints.\ grace of well-etched or engraved print confists first in bright light.\ dark shade by which understand that the faint hatching on the\ lighted parts be kept almost imperceptible and the shady touches contrarily\ strong and dark secondly that the naked or carnations be hatched fine and\ somewhat dull and the draperies courser and rougher accordingto their qualities yet all without any outline either on the light or shaded side even so that the ex-\ tremities be only formed by the tint of the grounds against which they come.\ but to give the work the greatest perfection and shew the judgment of the\ master the tints of the colours should also appear as much as possible yet as print does not so intirely consist of fine ordonnance beautiful figures elegant\ by-works and neat cut or etched strokes as in good general harmony so this\ harmony ought to be principally studied.\ the engraver will be commendable sometimes to express in his work the co\'ac\ lours if the matter require it such as the white and black in the day and night good and bad angels or spirits these two observations are absolutely neces-\ sary in book-print the others before-mentioned are only requisite in such as\ represent complete picture for there is great difference between book and\ other prints the former express the matter which is represented even were it\ designed in white marble bafs relief nay in snow or sand and the latter con-\ sider only the master who painted it and his art together with that of the engraver\ and his capacity for this reason book-prints stand in need of explanation but\ other prints not for the colour is in the one what the writing is in the other.\ chap of the difference of engraving and etching.\ according to the general opinion and not without reason etching\ is accounted more loose and designer-like than engraving because\ there is no difference between etching and drawing as to the handling but the difference between drawing and engraving is very great the\ management of the needle is the same with that of chalk or the pen the plate lies flat and firm like the paper to draw upon but wefind the contrary\ in engraving wherein the graver is held almost parallel with the plate and the\ latter is moveable on qushion or sand-bag and as to force there is also less\ occasion forit in etching than engraving.\ now to prove that etching must needs be more designer-like than engraving let us only make our remarks on both in the course of their bufinefs each having\ design before him and then we shall find the reason to be that in the one both\ the drawing and plate are fixed before the artist and he only moves his hand whereas the other can not go forward without stirring the plate being continually\ turning and both the hand and arm employed in directing the graver by which\ means engravers are often hindered from perceiving the difference between their\ work and the pattern before part nay the whole be finished wherefore in\ my opinion etching is superior to engraving in exactnefs and speed say speed because three or more plates may be etched before one can be engraved etching\ is also most designer-like because of its near affinity with drawing as we daily\ experiment for where one painter or designer engraves for his pleasure an hun-\ dred take to etching and make good progrefs therein because of the slow ad-\ vances in engraving compared to etching whether in figures or buildings but\ especially landscape and since painters or designers care not to have their de-\ signs censured and corrected by others they chule rather to etch them themselves\ than to set about engraving an art not to be mastered without much expence of\ time in getting knowledge how to handle the tool whereby it would become\ rather labour than diversion.\ many engravers etch for pleasure because of its easiness but seldom any etcher\ handles the graver unless in case of necessity tothis perhapsit may be objected that as each painter or designer has particular choice wherein he labours most as one in the ordonnance another in nicety of draught and third in the neat\ finishing of some particular things therefore the title of designer-like in etching is not absolutely due to painters or designers to which answer that undoubt-\ edly the word must not be understnod to relate to modern designers because it\ was in use before etching was brougt to its present perfection as appears by\ caracci titian antonio tempesta who excelled in design andused the needle\ with noother view than to give the world the designs which they counted capital\ and most praise-worthy for the encouragement and consideration of the less\ knowing.\ knowing whereby we plainly perceive that their intention was only to put\ forth their own performances in such manner as safely to be relied on accord-\ ingly we scarce see any more in them than an out-line but this is so firm\ and correct that however slightly the other parts may be scratched these works thus of their own hands are more valued than those of the best and most famous\ engravers or etchers.\ we have example in the print of the woman by the well etched by caraea\ bimself how much it differs from that done by le potre and another by bissop.\ what vast difference is there between perrier\'92 and bissiop\'92 works as\ to the designer-likeness and looseness of-handling and in landscapes between\ titian\'92 and perelle\'92 could if need required produce more proofs of the an-\ tiquity of the word designer-like but shall wave them and acquaint the read-\ er how oddly took to etching and how strangely drudged before could\ gain my point.\ having in mny youth an inclination for etching but no knowledge of what\ was good or bad as seeing no other examples than the old and poorly en-\ graved prints of raphael michael angelo paul veronese tintoret which yet\ were excellent for their fine out-line and few etched ones my slender at-\ tempts may be easily guessed at indeed can not but still think of it\ with wonder for began not with copper or steel but piece of pew-\ ter and nail about finger\'92 length which with great pains ground to\ point after my own way first tried only singie strokes and then cross-\ hatching which looked strange enough and instead of rolling-press rubbed the backsides of my proofs with the nail.. this however did not\ abate my curiosity which daily encreased though my work appeared so\ black as to be scarce intelligible my father seeing this could not forbear\ laughing and for humour sake gave two or three of my proofs to bartho-\ let and he again to natalis the famous engraver who bestowed on me some\ little instruction and small copper-plate to try on but what drudgery\ had undergone before scratched this beautiful plate bosse\'92 book of etch-\ ing happening to be publisned about that time left off plaguing myself and cheerfully set about splitting of wood providing needles boiling grounds cleaning plates buying aqua-fortis wax when before knew of no\ better ground than thick and foul oil out of the smushi-pot boiled to blackneis which gave me no little trouble to get off the plate again after it\ was bit and which therefore was obliged to put into the fire till it was\ soft as lead things so far succeding to my wishi happened to see some\ prints of vovet from france which spurred my curiosity and should cer-\ tainly have made early and good progress had not my father leen fearful might six my thoughts on this study to the neglect of painting wherefore\ he dissuaded me from it saying it was too soon to enter on so difficult pastime and instructing me in other things as delightful as advantageous.\ marrying some years after went to holland were re-asumed this noble\ art with great pleasure and which do not repent of though some think\ it the cause of my misfortune the truth of this god knows yet had saved\ faved candle and ufed more day-light for it perhaps my old age might\ have proved more comfortable to me but alasl those two noble sisters painting and etching are now vanished with my sight.\ let the reader judge whether he ever heard of stranger way of etch-\ however mention it here to shew that diligent man getting\ ing.\ better instruction may in time gain his point it is certain that few young\ men would have had patience enough to drudge as did without instruction but that an industrious tyro after leaving his master may possibiy improve\ through diligence and study is very natural even so as to excel him in\ neatness smoothnefs and expedition as well in etching as engraving mean\ in the use of the graver and needle but not in knowledge by knowledge\ understand keeping the likeness of beautiful face hands and feet accord-\ ing to what we say in the second chapter that the knowledge consists in correct out-line proportion light and shade and perspective for we com-\ monly see the greatest faults committed in the aforesaid parts for want of know-\ ledge and not inuring themselve to draw by hand large things after small and\ the contrary but accustoming themselves to squaring practice not difficult\ to swineherd\'92 boy if he understood the division of squares and management\ of chalk but they may yet be eroneous in tracing their object on the plate though drawn upon squares for missing the out-line in the least either inward-\ ly or outwardly it presently becomes too little or too big but the tyro can not see this for want of due knowledge and though he may be sensible that here\ or there he has little missed the out-line yet he passes it over as matter\ of no great moment and if he propose to help it in etching or engraving he\ may possibly forget it before he come so far in the work he commonly thinks\ no further than what is already on the plate whence we may easily conclude that he who knows what constitutes beauty can be as little sensible that small\ difference in face arm or hand is of any great consequence another diffi-\ culty no less than the former is that though the tyro have the out-line cor-\ rectly drawn on the plate yet he may run over it when he comes to shade or\ hatch and as this fr\'e9quently happens shall here give the reason of it.\ in either engraving or etching anything the off-work whcther buildings landscape or even grounds ought always to be begun first that by reserving\ the principal things for the last the hand may be prepared to handle them\ with more boldness now the tyro being to engrave or etch ground be-\ hind his figure be it naked or dressed he will not only especially in engraving end his hatching against the out-line but sometimes exceed it whereby the\ parts whetiier arm leg or hand must needs loose their truc proportion and\ quality gatthus the almost imperceptible and tender rising muscles folds the work goes on and when they come to sce the mistake they scrape burn-\ isn and rub to bring it right again which grant is well enough in case of\ need but alas hoy seldom is it practised ff it be something of no great\ consequence it remains as it was without further inspection this know not\ by hearsay but experience wherefore they who have an inclination for en-\ graving should apply to painter for instruction in beautiful proportion and\ in drawing every thing by hand whether prints drawings paintings plaister-\ figures even the life itself for painters first teach the theory or knowledge of\ proportion and then the practice of colouring whereas many engravers begin\ with the practice or handling as for the scraping burnishing and rubbing out before-mentioned it is point which ought to be well understood because it affects not either the too\ great darkness or hardness of the hatching but the out-line as shall shew by\ the example of the faces in plate lxix.\ in the face the hatched ground runs over the out-line of the cheek where-\ by it appears more sunk in as in that of and thus the out-line is lost now\ this face being to be finished and the cheek brought right again so much must\ be scraped off within the line as to give the chcek the former swell and if the\ face be fourth part less the difference will be so much the greater especially\ in portrait and greater still if it be in profile as face shiews wherein we see\ how little soever be taken off with the ground from the tip of the nose mouth and chin it will produce another aspect whence it it is evident what vast\ alteration this must cause in the likeness.\ in this art as well as painting it is constant rule to be begin with the\ painters for when the principal figures are finished the whole piece is reckoned\ into the work here somewhat more strength there more faintness but\ what we now speak of to wit scraping concerns engraving only whereas in\ etching nothing is done but stopping unless things are already bit.\ if it be afked whether what is stopped up can be repaired -before\ it is bit as in when the hatching which takes away the swell from the\ cheeks is stopped up with stop-ground whether then the former roundness can-\ not be fetched out with fine needle on the same ground that all may bite to-\ gether answer that this will make bad work but if something be wanting it must be touched up with the graver however shall shew another method make burnissier pretty hot and rub it gently and speedily over the part you\ would have out and then it will close up the hatching so that you need neither\ stop up nor bite now etch thereon what is necessary and thus all may be bit\ at once these observations especially that of not carelessly spoiling the out-line\ as in the examples and are very needful.\ let any person now consider how little fine ordonnance of famous maf-\ ter when put out of hand in such condition can be like the original and\ vet this is too often the case however assert that without the former know-\ ledge it is impossible to become good master for he who makes blunder-\ ing design and perceives not the mistakes to be apparent and convincing can-\ not possibly mend them even great masters sometimes blunder as we see in\ audran\'92 battles of alexander after le brun what poor hands and fingers he has\ made in some places as thin as pencil-sticks especially those which are wide\ open as the captive porus and in darius can not too much wonder that\ in\ in so glorious work audran did not correct such mistakes since he was one of\ the best engravers ever known this indeed is but small matter with respect\ to so great work nevertheless it makes the same imperfect and becomes charge upon le brun but this work had less justice done it here in holland in\ the copies of schoonebeek who seems to have used his utmost endeavours to.\ spoil it for there is neither design nor keeping observed all the postures which in the originals are fine and beautiful he has turned into grimace every\ thing is lame and crippled.\ chap remarks on hatching.\ he course of hatching yields great pleasure to the eye because it makes\ every thing appear in its nature and quality whether wood silk steel water silver wood stone sand each of which in engraving and etching require particular exprefsion yet in etching it is more expeditious especially\ if you can somewhat handle the graver the french artist audran excelled herein.\ the st. bruno of bartholet engraved by natalis is admirable for the naturalnefs which by particular hatchings and the utmost neatness appears therein.\ now when great artist has shewn his utmost sxill in plate and all things\ are worked accordiag to rule yet we find it almost impossible to make people sen-\ sible what true art is and wherein the knowledge of good print lies most\ men now -- days being taken with sine strokes without regard to ill order or bad\ design sad reflexion for those who know better again an engraver or etcher is not so happy as painter or designer for\ these last compose what they please or at least what they can and the engravers\ must follow them be they ever so indifferent yet this were no great matter if\ they might but etch and engrave with as much freedom as painters use with\ their pencils or crayons this would spirit them to produce finer things as other\ ingenious men have formerly done who had their liberty and did not tie them-\ selves up to any person as many now -- days are obliged to do how seldom\ have they an opportunity to work after fine picture or finished drawing this\ has often induced me to think that many good master understands more than\ his works shew happy are they whose circumstances will permit them to exe-\ cute even but single plate according to their skill and pleasure but alas the times will not allow it in these our free and noted countries moreover we\ see many artists sigh and groan under the difficulties laid on them by some pain-\ ters and designers in sometimes sending them such rude drawings that the\ round can hardly be distinguished from tne square the sharp from the blunt or\ wood from stone even such as they themselves could not sunderstand swere\ they to receive them from others if the engraver happens to hit the design the\ master claims honour but on failure the engraver is sure to bear the scandal for this reason it were to be wishied that engravers would before they begin plate after such drawing or sketch consult the painter or designer for reso-\ lution of all their doubts and that they might proceed with certainty.\ also think it not only useful but necessary that the designer be particular in\ his expression of all the materials for instance that the basement-story of building shew to be of rough stones the columns and pilasters with the imagery\ and ornaments of marble that the engraver may exhibit the former rough\ by broken strokes and what is sinooth and polished by neat and more curious\ ones with the graver etching the by-works somewhat coarser again the wood\'ac\ work with long and broken strokes humouring the grain the trees according to\ the course of the boughs and sway of the leafing the grounds serpentine and\ also broken these observations ought to be heeded in general as well as in\ the particulars together with the diminution of the off-scape yet not in the man-\ ner of some by wide strokes but by closing and making them fine on this\ footing there would be lafs complaint of the designers and these not think\ themselves injured on seeing their designs so ill followed things thus worked\ according to rule would certainly prove fine and the more in work of conse-\ quence and bearing price though to one who understands his business this\ management is no more trouble than the contrary.\ have seen drawings of goltzius wherein he had plainly expressed all the par-\ ticular objects the tender or smooth bodies were well washed also neatly scum-\ bled with red or black chalk what was rough or coarse he had handled boldly\ with the pen or black chalk by which means the one appeared darker and the\ other lighter in the shade as if it were picture but it is no wonder that we\ see not such things done now -- days for goltzius used to make his own pat-\ terns and as good painter considers what ought to be ftone wood flesh white or black before he colours so goltzius did the same when he was to engrave\ any thing he would express every thing in his patterns though he was ever so\ certain of his art in order to do his whole worst after slight sketch and that no-\ thing might escape him on belief that we ought not to trust to our memories\ in matter of consequence wherefore shall illustrate this point by an example\ in plate lxx wherein introduce several different bodies for besides the icor-\ rectness of draught have alfo expressed their different colours the wall is rough stone the child tenderly shaded the vessel of bright copper the vase white polished marble the pedestal or foot of free-stone the\ wooden pale whereon hangs cloth veiny and the sky and off-scape as it goes off the fainter and finer by this method of expression have still\ another advantage which is that if liy accident should leave my plate half\ done another hand by this means may understand my meaning and finifh it.\ hereby even painter may direct another who else would rather chuse to\ have the works he might leave behind him unfinisned rubbed out than that\ another who did not rightly know his mind should finish them.\ chap vi curious remarks touching stipping.\ any imagine they can represent the roundness against the main lights by stipping but they will find themselves mistaken since it causes great\ fungriness and therefore the method can not be good hatching looks better and has more affinity with the shades stipping is sometimes useful in case of\ need when we care not to cross-hatch on the light and also when the shades\ are hatched too wide in order to express the restexions somewhat the plainer in-\ stead of crossing them over again especially again the light though it is better\ to go over them again with asine single stroke and if you find this will not do then you may with finer needle continue the same hatching somewhat far-\ ther but better method would be to lay it at once as far as it ought to be and then somewhat to stop up the ends or extremities he who neglects this is\ obliged to make shift with stipping yet that must not be too close the best\ way is first with fine needle to continue the hatching little further and\ hatching as was old visscher\'92 way in his boors after ostade whereby he prettily\ expressed the colour of face and fetched out the main light touches stip-\ ping is very helpful and also expeditious to one who has not got the firmness of\ hatching for the points thus lengthened answer the same purpose and then you\ can proceed with certainty especially if vou use the same needle with which the\ hatching is continued in the light round the relief the shades again ought\ to be softened with the same necdle that made them then the stipping of the\ large needle in the shade will not be too visible yet would you work the last\ stipping in the light with smaller needle you may but because the shade ends\ more suddenly than the relief in the light should use no others for the stip-\ ping is nice point to him who will be curious the stips ought also to be\ equal say equally distant and not to come between the extremities of the\ strokes if it be afked whether any thing hatched too wide can be darkened\ with stipping instead of third stroke my opinion is that it may and that\ any slight thing can be performed in this manner but the work is more tedious.\ things so touched up look very neat for by strong strokes fainter ones more\ faint and points we can very commodioussy darken an object more or less at\ pleasure boulanger has in my opinion over-stipped his prints which makes\ them look rather like miniature than any thing else wherefore can not much\ com-\ commend stipping and why because of the inequality and hungriness of the\ points or stips occasioned by touching one harder than another whereby in\ biting one penetrates the copper more than another be the dot ever so small add to this the impossibility of making the stips perfectly round they will\ always be more or lefs longifh as may be easily proved by magnisying\ glass.\ have seen in engraved prints of goltzius the faint tint upon the relief cross-\ hatched as well as in the shade but this is only proper for engraving espe\'ac\ cially in high finishing because in etching the cross hatching expresses com-\ ing shade and then it may be very well effected by stipping as broad-lighted\ objects want not so much darkness in the light.\ now if any thing should happen to be amiss and you would beat it out and\ mend it take proof and fasten it neatly behind your plate and then beat out\ what you would have away this may be done even to an hair and if you care\ not to strike on the paper you may mark the place with sharp point on the\ copper so as to see it which will do as well though the spoiling proof is\ but \'e0 trisse yet the proof when once dry is no more fit for this use where-\ fore the work must be done as soon as the proof comes from the prefs for being wetted again it will always be uncertain and unlike the plate in order\ to find these little places or misbit spots with still greater ease method which\ many engravers make secret of take fine thread or string and put it cross-\ wise about the plate tying it on the edges so that the center of the crofs\ come exactly upon the misbit spot or place then laying the plate backside up-\ wards on smooth and hard stone beat the place gently with pointed ham-\ mer and then with some stuff taken from the oil-stone rub it out thus you\ may find all the places how small soever even to an hair on the backside of the\ plate.\ dd\ chap vii of etching bass-reliefs.\ we have asserted that each object requires almost particular handling so think bafs reliefs call for it for many who can etch well after fine\ picture or drawing are at loss when they come to imitate and represent bass-\ relief they lay the strokes therein as in other objects though in my opinion the difference be very great especially if we would not handle them in the man-\ ner of perrier and pietro santi but according to rule though the former under-\ stood it the best of the two since his works better preserve the stoniness and de-\ sign and yet he has added some things of his own but the other has done it to\ such\ such excess as thereby to render his works obscure his folds indeed are fine yet superfluous and improper for stone and more like gold silver or bronze ap-\ pearing better in print than in stone in my opinion santi understood not the\ naked proportion muscling or motion wherefore can not by any means al-\ low him the preference the truth is they are good for drawing but were\ they to be compared with the life we should discover great difference in the\ next place it is absurd to imagine that so many bass reliefs as are found at\ rome and in other places both under cover and exposed in and upon the tri-\ umphal arches frizes niches pediments pedestals ancient walls tombs co-\ lumns and vases from whence these two artists made their collections should all\ stand in so precise \'e0 light right and left as they represent them in certainly some of them must have been lighted from above from below fronting even\ from all sides and can not think they drew them by candle-light but rather\ shaded them as they thought fit.\ was once afked whether since the bafs reliefs stand in many different places moulds or models have not sometimes been taken from them by one or other from which they shadowed their drawings disposing these models as usual in\ we\ the left or right light as they thought proper which is not improbable.\ might likewise light some from above others from below from side fronting\ and from behind in order to use them on any occasion which would be great\ help to those who know little or nothing of modelling.\ we have said that we think the bass-reliefs of perrier better in design than\ those of pietro santi but much inferior in finishing though the works of the\ latter for the reason before assigned have no affinity with the stoniness and\ yet some think that were the figures three or four feet high they would have\ another look for then the parts would appear more grand and those of perrier on the other hand too slim and dull which do not disown nevertheless it\ must be agreed that this observation is good in order to shew the difference\ between carving in stone and chasing in gold or silver but it is likewise true that had perrier finished his drawings as well as santi they would have been\ much finer and more useful for it is easier to leave out superfluities than\ make additions it is not improbable that santi\'92 intention by his method of\ management was that he might be of greater service to painters statuaries and\ chasers than perrier.\ we have affirmed that pietro santi has possibly added much of his own now it is also not unlikely that perrier drew his objects from greater distance than\ santi whereby he could not see all the minute parts and can not but at the\ same time think that santi designed most of his bass reliefs after undamaged\ within-door work in halls chambers and other inclosed places whereas perrier\ possibly took his from without-door work fuch as pediments frontispieces frizes.\ and the like half eaten up by the weather we might still subjoin that\ perrier worked only to shew the world that such excellent things were at rome and at the same time to display his light and firm manner of drawing whereas\ santi had not only view to profit but also to be generally useful to curious ar-\ tists and others how true this is let the virtuoso determine.\ as\ as to the right handling of bafs reliefs think it absolutely necessary that\ every thing be etched equally coarse or sine with one and the same needle with-\ out any difference with respect to stuffs as being the best method for represent-\ ing the stone-work well unless it were but grey one with fore-ground and\ off-scape when the strokes ought to diminish or grow faint according to\ perspective.\ there is likewise little observation made about the lights of bass-reliefs for oftentimes things painted sharp and in sun-shine are exhibited in the plate\ with common light through the roundness of the shades and somerimes we see\ the contrary but these are liberties tihich neither etchers nor engravers ought\ to take he whose province it is to imitate let him exactly follow the beaten\ path in relation to etching bass reliefs sharp light or sun-shine is very im-\ proper and renders them disagreeable but as for embellishments in sun-shine the matter is of less moment.\ chap viii of engraving and the management of the strokes.\ tis to be wondered that among the many arts and manual operations en-\ igraving is so little and etching so much treated of the reason whereof is\ past my apprehension many painters and lovers for the encouragement of\ those who would make it their business or to shew their skill have ear-\ nestly strove to say something of it but no engraver has to my knowledge undertaken the tafk possibly as not thinking themselves sufficient for it or\ else because they would keep it as secret from each other but the most pro-\ bable reason as think is the late appearance of this art which is evident since the romans till their latter times knew nothing of.\ it is certain that engraving as well as painting is founded as much on\ theory as practice and that both depend on established and positive rules which if orderly followed will make man master why then are they not made\ public for the information of the curious in what they want to know must\ not he who intends to go to certain town or village be first told where it\ lies and then the ways to it chusing the nearest as beft it is not strange that more engravers have applied to painting than painters\ to engraving because the latter have so many excellent books for their encou-\ ragement publisned by judicious masters whereas engravers have not one\ touching their practice but as every thing has its time so we must hope for\ it in this.\ nam mora dat vires teneras mora concoquit uvas et validas segetes quod fuit herba facit.\ or perfecting time brings on the tender grape and gives the herby corn it\'92 ripening shape.\ in the mean time fhall boldly enter the lists and according to my small\ ability impart what know of it but the practice or handling shall not touch\ upon as not having the greatest skill therein what however mention of it as unavoidably necessary to what purpose to say submit to those of better\ knowledge hoping my endeavours will not be taxed with presumption since my\ only aim is thereby to rouze noble genius\'92 and by my small spark to kindle\ greater fire according to the latin proverb parva sape scintilla magnum excita-\ we have before-mentioned first on what basis engraving is founded se-\ condly good engraver\'92 qualifications lastly what constitutes an agreeable\ print wherefore we shall now discuss the management of the strokes in objects according to their natures and courses with respect to perspective and as well in\ etching as engraving together with some examples for illustrating the point and\ preventing and correcting mistakes.\ in plate lxxi is wheel marked having eight spokes or points as\ also staff set upright in the ground crossed by the horizon this wheel shews that each spoke ought to have particular course according to its turn and that\ the strokes muff be governed by the extremity of each spoke as may be here\ seen the foremost runs circular the third almost straight compare\ also the foremost spoke one with the hinder one five how much they differ in\ force for one approaches and five retires which can not be otherwise according\ to perspective again the strokes drawn with ruler and running off towards\ the point of sight grow gradually finer and fainter now though the short\ or cross-hatching ought by established rule to be more visible and strong than\ the long yet few are observed to make any distinction therein.\ we have said before that each object whether flesh stone grounds re-\ quires particular stroke and among others that wood especially must be thick-\ stroked along the grain and consequently cross-hatched with finer stroke but\ now we shew the contrary for the cross ones are stronger than those running\ with the grain which here can not be otherwise if some say that contradict my-\ self in making the crofs-strokes thus against the grain ishall for their satisfac\'ac\ tion shew my reason for it observe then that any thing turned has no other\ grain than what the chisel makes and as the turner works against the grain and\ the wood retains more or less marks of the tool it must be expressed accordingly\ in engraving but second question may be whether it would not do as well if both the hatchings were equally fine or coarse answer it would as to the\ book xiii\ engraving.\ shade but not with respect to the stuff for it would be more proper to stonc copper wax and such-like nevertheless these observations are generally little\ heeded though also founded on certain rules of this art.\ as for the staff it shews that the strokes beginning round from below grow\ straiter as they approach the horizon and above the horizon the same but in reversed manner.\ now let us consider the other example in plate lxxi wherein the retiring\ parapets shew the diminution or faintneis of the strokes not only in such but in\ any other objects according to their distance in going off the one in greater the ocher in less degrec hertby we may plainly discover the perverse notion\ of some men namely that diminution implies growing scanty or wider see with single stroke from one end to the other now although the off-strokes\ scem neater than the near yet they are not so in fact but as the place dimi-\ nisties so the strokes close and thin in such manner that they become neither\ closer nor more fcanty the diminution of the figures and the three vases bears\ the same construction neverthelefs am sensible that many even old masters do otherwise in handling their retiring objects figures trees off-scape and sky more coarsly behind than forwards have even observed that they close-hatch\ the nearest and darkest sky and work wider and wider towards the horizon but\ this more in etching than engraving possibly to save the trouble of using two or\ more needles or of stopping up which is properly the point this example aims\ at for do not afk here whether it creates more troubl\'e9 but shew what may\ possibly be thought of less moment than in fact it is for instance place the\ three figures no ten or twelve steps apart and at the same distance\ on the parapet three vases also numbered whereby may be plainly per-\ ceived how much the one differs from the other but although in these figures\ the meaning is sufficiently to be understood to wit that the finer they are the\ more fine and close the strokes become yet have added the vases to them for\ the sake of those who may be curious enough to count the strokes when they\ will find not stroke more or less in the one than the other which in the figures\ would be tedious work observe in the next place the ground-shade of each fi-\ gure against the parapet each growing faint according to its distance and with\ what certainty the accurate tints of the figures may be perceived thereon even to\ know how much they diminisn and grow finer and at the same time how much\ the light differs but let it not be thought sufficient that the shades diminish or\ grow faint and the white remains all over the light since we know that the\ plan or ground can not shew its level otherwise than by means of light forwards going off darker and darker for instance were white figure or white stone stand-\ ing forwards and you would place such another further in where the ground is\ darker you must govern vourself by the ground where the first object stands as\ being subject to the same rule if things be well finished if the plan or ground\ be finished the figures ought to be so likewise are they airily handled and\ broad-lighted the ground must be the same and though the ground in its co-\ lour be more or less dark yet that is not regarded in this case because we are\ speaking only of the diminution of the tints consisting of white and black.\ suppose\ dloitized by google\ suppose the floor were of white marble and the figures the same or in white\ draperies the foremost would be broad lighted and the more distant less and\ less white were it even in sun-shine nay if the light came from behind or from\ aside the most distant would only keep an utmost heightening and still less were\ the colours expressed in it as they who understand perspective well know nor\ can it be otherwise as may be seen in the first example in the child\'92 hand hold-\ ing the end of the hindmost spoke which plainlv appears to have little or no\ whiteness and as for the stuffs of the objects as linen cloth and such like some\ may rather think them possible to be so worked than the naked because having\ already engraved forwards as neat and fine as may be we can therefore further\ in not express any thing finer or neater but say that as things having the\ utmost neatness do not become neater by distance nor alter in the eye but dis-\ appear so when the objects are very remote neither silk linen or woollen is to\ be distinguished so far as it concerns the hatching but the coarse parts always\ keep their forms and this observation respects not only the three stuffs but\ also figures stones grounds trees here some perhaps may say how can\ the strokes possibly unite the light when they as they retire ought to be closer\ and closer especially when the air which on the horizon is clear and bright\ and free from clouds unless they widen more and more towards the horizon were they never so faint to which answer as experience will prove that when\ the strokes thus thin and grow faint in their going off they certainly disappear\ and die away nay become at last invisible and unite enough with the light even were it sun-shine though they be ever so close and such length think\ the graver can go when skilfully managed in etching the needle can do the\ same by stopping up.\ however question not but my proposition will be taxed with impossibility\ and puzzling novelty especially by such as are not thorough engravers who may\ blame me for thus disclosing the grounds of this noble art and so plainly shewing\ truth but my answer in the first place is that find myself obliged in duty to\ do so since all my wishies tend towards its arriving at the greatest perfection se-\ condlv because what lay down is prescribed by certain rules of the mathematics though sew are senlible that the art of engraving in general flows therefrom and\ that different objects require different handlings but rather believe that good\ method of drawing will easily lead to engraving notion true enough in etch-\ ing though even therein the point lies most in the biting and stopping up.\ as\ to engraving vou must certainly be conversant with the handling and force\ of\ the graver two points not to be attained without great experience though\ the beginning it is better for an etcher to have no handling at all becaute he\ may then gradually the better bring the graver to the needle and in an uniformity\ of strokes adapt the one to the other and make them harmonious whereas some relying too much on the graver use it here and there in their slovenly works with-\ out any difference and that with incredible carelessness sometimes cutting fore-\ ground stone or stem of tree neat and smooth which ought to be rough and\ knobby when at the same time they are working face or marble figure with\ the\ the needle this must be owing either to their carelessness or desier of ease or\ their ignorance since such doings are against reason and common instruction.\ could mention many such disorderly prints among others there is one of the\ raising of lazarus done by berry wherein the figure of lazarus with so much of\ the linen as comes about his body is etched and the rest of the linen lying on\ the ground neatly engraved whereby one part looks like linen and the other\ like silk the one is here and there stipped and the other is not but perhaps\ the plate was not well bit it also sometimes happens that we are obliged to\ rub out things which makes good my affertion for if the fault lie in the plate the master ought as much as possible to help it by his knowledge and judgment.\ could he handle the graver why did he not shew it and make things agree and\ if he was not master of the graver why did he not better follow the strokes of\ the needle \'92 had he insteed of cross-hatching made the strokes somewhat finer and\ triple hatched them and used some stipping then it would have been passable.\ there is another print with an ornament round it representing sacrifice of\ flora or the spring which is also wretchedly etched and engraved for the fore-\ most figures as charity piety and time and every thing else on the fore-ground\ are neatly finished and mostly engraved but the figures on the second ground so\ slight and poorly etched as not to have any agreement with the others the\ strokes even look as if they were dabbed on and drawn with shaking hand in-\ stead of growing fainter every where which would make the work neat and in-\ tire this artist might have known that he could not make the graver and the\ needle agree.\ am sensible some will determine that many things such as water silver gold and such like smooth and shining bodies can be more conveniently express-\ ed with the graver then the needle but in my opinion fkilful hand can\ give every thing its naturalness.\ it is very strange to me in the old prints that the masters have in nothing re-\ prepsented the natural qualities but etched every thing after one manner whether\ nudities draperies air grounds or stone except water and yet not this with thin\ and thick strokes but only crofs parallels and those very unlike oftentimes close and then wide as if they were scratched again they have not expressed any\ colour and always made the water dark and brown now to create difference\ in shining bodies my thoughts are that you first lay the strokes strong and pa\'ac\ rallel and of reasonable width from each other and then close them by putting\ thinner between mean in water black marble polished steel and such like for\ by this method we produce certain stir shewing the smoothness and glitter.\ if it be afked why in etching the strokes which are close and thick sometimes\ fly up though the plate be in good condition and the ground neither burnt nor\ too hard answer that have found by experience that when the water is too\ strong and at first bites too sharp we must then take our chance because the\ plate being cold can not grow warm so soon as the ground which therefore is for-\ cibly lifted from the plate and presently rises and the sooner if the strokes be\ close and thick which happens not so easily in the tender parts wh\'eare by the\ thinness and width of the strokes the water has not so much power to get under\ them.\ them to prevent this the water must be somewhat weakened and the ground\ and plate gradually made warm in order to make them unite with each other especially in cold weather for in the warm months of june july and august it is\ not necessary because we then use harder grounds.\ now to kuow whether the ground be in good condition make scratch or\ two with large needle in spare place of the plate and if the ground come out\ of the strokes like dust it is then too hard but if in curls it is in good temper especially if you can blow them off if they can not be wiped off with soft fea-\ ther but stick to the ground it is then too soft this is nice point it fome-\ times happened to me that here and there they remained in the strokes.\ some etchers also frequently give themselves needless trouble when they put\ out the out-lines which are made too strong on the light side with stop-ground which youknow always flows more or less overthem especially if the place be hot but consider what trouble they must afterwards have when the out line is gone for they are obliged to renew with the graver all the strokes running against it.\ wherefore the best way is to trace the drawing neatly on the plate and mark\ at first softly with small point the dark touches as those of the eyes nose and\ mouth on the snaded side yet not on the light but to help them in stopping up\ their too strong strokes shall assign better method than that of the stop-\ ground.\ take thick-ground white-lead thinned with oil of turpentine and spread it\ with small pencil over the out-line so as just to cover it and no further but\ be very careful not to do it over more then once lest you take off the ground for the oil afterwards evaporates and in the biting you must also not wipe over\ it with the featiier this is an invention of afriend of mine and though never\ experimented it yet question not its success mention white-lead but you\ chap ix of the black art or mezzotinto\ hough no figure of this art is to be found in caesar ripa as having been\ unknown to him yet since in our times through its foundation laid by\ princes and the kind affistance of great men it is arived at so great perfection hope the following figure will not be unacceptable to the profefsors and lovers\ of it.\ figure of the black art or mezzotinto.\ here you see young and plump virgin of frefh complexion and ami\'ac\ able countenance dressed in black velvet lined and faced with sky-blue pow-\ dered with gold glittering stars she has broad gold girdle embroidered\ with black bats which diminisn towards the arms her head attire is wanton\ and\ and modish adorned here and there with small flowers about her neck is gold chain to which hangs medal exhibiting burning altar and these\ words magnae britann\'c6 in her right hand is small tool like lancet together with feather and in the left table whereon is painted an\ head on black ground representing nature she poises airily on one leg as\ if she were dancing.\ explanation.\ the art is represented young and plump to fignyfy that she is still growing.\ the black velvet gown and stars imply that like the stars she is sprung from\ dark night the golden girdle and bats give us to understand that though her\ productions are not very lasting yet she makes great gains the chain with\ the niedal and altar thereon proclaims her lustre and the words round it\ allude to an offering of thanks to great-britain to whom she owes her origin\ and glory the table with the figure of nature shews that she excels therein.\ the rest explains itself.\ why this beautiful figure bears the name of the black art never heard though her practice sufficiently gives us the reason to wit that she proceeds from\ black and though the art of etching also seems to be derived from black yet it is done in quite different manner for the former comes forth from the\ light and the latter from the shade the one heightens and the other\ shadows.\ we have already said that etching is in speed superior to engraving but\ the black art is more expeditious then either of them and in neatnefs has\ not its fellow it may even compair with painting how soft and sluent\ seover abating for the colours indeed in duration and wear it is the weakest but on the other hand its expeditiousness brings in more money.\ this noble art preferable to any engraving in representing uncomon lights as candle torch lamp fire and the like wherefore think it does not im\'ac\ properly bear the name of the black art it is remarkable not to be above\ fifty ycars standing and yet is ariyd at so great perfection those other arts\ have required more time but england where the climate is healthful and\ temperate has contributed much to its neatnefs and lustre there it had\ its birth and furtherance for prince rupert gave us the first example where\ fore we may rightly stile it noble the first print saw of this prince was of an\ old man\'92 head with cloth about it taken as far as know from an italian\ painting it was designed so sine and great and broad handled as if washed with\ the pencil by the best master it even looked by reason of the natural softness\ or melting not to be less than black art the same prince also invented cer-\ ain metal bearing his name which it will retain for ever doubt not but this art will in time become delightful diversion to painters for thr\'e9e reafons one for its easiness in learning two for its neatneis and lastly for its conveniency.\ it is easily learned by any one who is accustomed to draw on grounded or\ blue paper because there is no difference in operation between the scraping on the\ plate and heightening on the grounded paper beginning with the greatest light and\ sparing the shade as we have shewed in our drawing-book touching the handling\ of crayons or chalk pencils wherefore affirm that it comes nearer to paint-\ ing than etching or engraving and it is so easily apprehended mean in theo-\ ry as to be learned in lefs than three days.\ it is neat and free from soil and smell as not requiring either stop-ground grease or aqu\'e6-fortis.\ lastly the conveniency arising from it may be easily conjectured as it is more\ expeditious then either etching or engraving.\ but many are so eager in this art to learn neat scraping as to neglect the princi\'ac\ and when correct design is wanting in plate or print what judicious person will\ approve it indeed we can not manage here as in etching where the out-line may\ be traced on the plate with needle for the white sometimes goes out or is so faint\ as scarce to be seen besides it is inconvenient to scrape figures against light\ ground though artists generaly use to work the figure first and then the off-scape\ against it now to prevent this inconvenience first scrape vour back-ground and\ spearthe neat out-line rather keeping little out from it tillthe figure be finished afterwards you may gently scrape nearer thus you will not so easily run over\ the out-line as when vou begin with the figure.\ painters and that of engravers for the former making it only their diversion do\ not finish things so very highly as the latter who have been brought up therein and make it their constant bufiness painters are satisfied with shewing only good\ design and general decorum because when they were neatly to finissi one plate thay can work another.\ this art is certainly easy to person of good knowledge but if the work be\ not light enough at first go over it second time indeed you must not think to\ finish up at once because till proof be taken you can not possibly know what con-\ dition your plate is in do like the painters first to dead-colour with broad\ parts and then finisn now having proof you can give the work its main\ heightness and thus with patience finisn every part point requiring neither\ much time nor study but little observation there is published print of little satyr which in an hour\'92 time scraped loose in my hand as walked in garden and after proof taken finished in another hour few learn this art because as il think they can not be persuaded how easy it is and with what few\ circumstances attended but should the lovers set about it we may possibly in\ time see it become too common and etching and engraving neglected mean in\ objects pecular to theb lack art such as portraits night and candle-pieces spectres\ and inchantments apparitions flowers fruits silver gold china-ware crystal arms\ and herbs who will be able to etch or engrave those things so perfect and nat-\ tural\ tural as thay can be scraped but in figure architecture bass-reliefs and landsca pe the art is weak and not at all so proper as engraving.\ it is great pity that both this beautiful art and the artist have so bad ame\ as if the one were witchcraft and the other magician though nothing but mere\ art-works long to hear what name the italians will give it the french and\ english agreeable to the dutch call it the former 'art noire and the latter the\ black art an improper and unnatural name unless they mean first that the\ artist works the light out of the black ground and in the next place to distinguish\ it from etching and engraving
