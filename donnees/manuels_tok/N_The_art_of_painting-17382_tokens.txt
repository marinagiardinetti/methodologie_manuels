give an handle for exercife in skerching fuch another.\ have cholen for this purpofe the fable of dryope and will it as much as poffible to the ornament of landskips making it\ without-door prospect.\ the story according to ovil is this dryope infentible of the\ forrowful difafter that was to befal her on certain time took walk by lake encompaffed with myresss with intent to make the\ no vi\ of

the was much affrighted and the more when in going thence the fell her feet to fatten into the earth for the was transformed into\ tree.\ exhibir the subject see plare iv in delightful valley ac.\ cording to the tellimony of the poet planted with myrtles and en-\ compatted by brook in the middle of the piece place as the\ principal the tree lofos full of red bloffoms and thickly leaved.\ from

her breaff heaves and her under parts draw\ quite back her knees are bent her right foot finng out and the\ left drawn back as if the were fainting away she is about of\ years of age the nymph who

with amazement and makes it known to\ the other fitting towards the water who therefore fupporting herfelf\ on her left hand turns her upper parts to the right in order to look\ back they have mottly chaplers either on their heads or lying by\ them.\ thus much as to the difpoficion and actions of the moveable by-\ ornaments which confifting of virgins each is contralted according ro\ ber paffien we now proceed to the immoveable ornaments.\ on the left side on rifing ground between the trees place\ large fronting priapus-term without arms or legs mottly in the\ shade againtt the offskip which frongly throws off the foremoff\ croup on the right side forwards half in the water fet square\ large rough stone whereon lies garment or veil and parcel of\ leares and flowers in the pannel of this

ning aucumn and in fine weather for the time of vear the ligbt\ is side one lictle fronting the sun may be put in or left out as\ every one pleafes becaute tis not meationed or infifted on in the\ fable.\ shall next proceed to delcribe the further circumflances of this or-\ donnance fince without thewing the light and darkness harmony\ and colours tis imperfelt and not like narure it matt be granted that the harmony and sbalowing ofcenrimes thew themfelves and that\ the light is fufficieatly apparent to him who undertands perspective\ bur whether there may not occur fill someching beyond the common\ guess and judgment very much question as for the colours they\ mall needs be exprefted fince without it tis impoffible to know or\ penetrate mine or any other painter thougt ts.\ therefore affign dryege as the principal charalter blue sattin\ garment one flappet whereof goes over her right shoulder and comes\ under her cirdle and the other is in her left hand with which the\ holds the naked child about the middle when the remainder with\ an under flap tucked in the girdle under her left bresfl covers all\ her other parts down to the feet except the leff leg and foor whichh\ is rooted in the ground her under garment as likewife the open\ rr vi\ of landskips.\ abor her lef arm is yellowith white with green reffexions.\ her garment next the left leg is open the foremofl nymph is al.\ mort mked having no other covering than fine white fmall scarf\ about her middle the drefies of dryope and lole are intermixed\ with gold in order to make difference between them and the\ nymphs the nymph who is naked to the middle dress in dark\ green gown gathered at the navel and faftened by girdle jol\ has an arry garment clote-fleeved of bright rofe-colour girt with\ broad girdle of dark violet embroidered with gold and under it\ flowered coat open below and giving freedom to the legs the\ sione forward is greyith and the vetiel dark red the ground next\ water is gratty and thus variegate the whole fore-ground.\ the nymph who on the right side of the fecond ground comes\ running has greenith brealtgarment loofe and untied without\ sleeves and faftened but on one shoulder the sedd brealtand legs be\ ing bare the other firting further behind on the edge of the\ rver leave quire naked her companion has small green scarl\ the fone priagus is dark grey inclinable to

liybted either from behind before or fidewife yet in fuch sort as that the\ caule thereof and of the shades as by what and from whence may\ plainly appear otherwife they will be but loofe fancies without\ foundation\ poffibly queltion whether hereby the light will antwer\ some may\ my purpofe becaute alliga dryoge blue garment over yellowith\ whice one judging not without feeming reafon yet without knowing\ my incention that the contrary would look more decorous namely the light over the dark becaute the greateft and ftrongeft mass of\ light falling on her middle parts to wit belly and legs the naked\ child would be more beautifully fet off if her breaft or upper parts\ were dark than againtt the yellowith-whice this with respect to\ the light willingly allow but not as to the colour for deligned\ ly made the garmentblac in order to make the naked nymph bear\ riful and yet with intention that that part might keep ftrong and\ broad light for this reafon have cholen stuff for it according.\ ly it being known that satuin has glols and almoft the same force\ as gold or silver stutts the red garment of lole as being beaw\ set off\ rifal and light colour will be fufficiendy yet not too much againtt\ of landships.\ chap the dark ground bot the blue has here on account of the\ great mass more power tho having more light about ir for the\ red is but fmall spot have as much as poffible confidered the\ probabiliry of this reprefentation and the harmony in the dilpofiti-\ onof the colours affigning each figure its particular and proper em-\ blematic coloar not only in the draperies but alfo in the nudities giving one fair and tender another more brownith skin and to\ forth each figure has likewife its particular charalteriffic the\ head of the water-nymph is adorned with white bell-fowers that of\ the woodnympb with wild plants and that of her who comes running\ forward with field-fowers if it be wondered that make mention\ of sattin fince we rarely hear it was in ufe among the anciets fay the obtervation is jull with respect to staruarres but not as to\ painters becaute have met with feveral old pictures whereini have\ seen sattin reprefented bur how long that stuff has been known to the\ world can not tell nor shall enquire in the meantime it mult be\ allowed to be beautiful and elegant sruff as are alfo the changeable\ silks tho in alels degree and more proper for youg people.\ if any difficulty arile from my incroducing into this story priapus-\ term fince theres neither god man faunus or satyr in the whole\ piece nor the lealt sign of any indecent action will give him my\ reafon which is that the poct relating the firft caule of the difafter\ befalling this unhappy woman afcribes it to the tree lores becaute\ when woman and priapus could not farisfy his lult with her he\ in revenge transformed her into that tree bearing her name laying curfe on thofe who violated it and fill recains that vindictive in-\ mour wherefore place him here as the firft promoter of the ac\ cident.\ inliff largely on thefe fables or ordonnances to give an handle for\ further inquiries into them for ovid is not full and parricular in all his.\ fables

whether it be of moiff or dry nacure or where it grows moll plen-\ tifully wherefore as far as have mer with them shall produce\ the teltimonies of fome authors about this tree together with the\

heavenly and earchly things iis moreover ufed to repreient the suns rifing and seiring especially with the addition\ of coii peringon it by which they lignitied the morning vapours which the sun

all painters do not\ give in wholly to portraiture fince now days money is preferred to\ aearning lucre to virtue and honours dispented to men in propor-\ tion to their riches but leaving this subjelt we will proceed\ throughly to confider every thing relating to that branch of the\ att.\ as in mutick and singing good ear is requifite to in portraiture\ iis impostible to excel without good eye fuch an one mean as\ is poverned by fedate and fober senfation and not by self-love of\ palfion next is required regufar defgs containing an exact pro-\ portion of divition of the parts not only of the face but of the\ whole body that the sitter may be known by his pilture which\ may be moft agreeably done by mmixing the fashich with what is paint-\ ortike as the great lely did and which is called the painterlike of\ antique manner but by the ignorant commonalry the roman man-\ dct.\ next we mult be thoroughly judicious in the graceful choice of the\ light and the place where the perfon is to fit that the face may\ appear to the beft advantage and then the body is to be difpoted to\ the moft natural and becoming pesture.\ the next bulinets and which gives it the greateff luftre is the\ colouring that each perfon and his parts may have their preper cor\ bur atid fuch as appears in his daily converfe not fuch as proceeds\ from extraordihary emotions let the arciff beware of inclining to\ any particular manner like fome whofe work is thereby better\ known to be theirs than the friends of the sitter know the pictun\ to be his.\ as for the chostr of light in order to apply it moft advanidgiont\ ly for the benefit of either sex irs certainly matter of great mo\ ment no periraiture.\ book vii\ fince the fair sex commonly partake of more delicacy and\ grace than men to they muft have light as beautiful and agreea-\ ble as their perfons.\ but tere we proceed further it will not be improper to look into\ the origin of pertraits in order thereby to thew the aim of thofe\ who caufe themfelves to be drawn and the profirs which mafters get\ thereby.\ the ancients uted to caule thofe from whom the common-wealth\ had received extraordinary benefits either in war or civil affairs or\ for eminence in religion to be reprefented in marble or metal or\ in pilture that the sight of them by thofe honours might be spur to pofterity to emulate the fame virtues this honour was firft\ begiun with their deities afterwards it was paid to heroes and of\ confequence to philosephers oraters religious men and others not\ only to perpecuace their virtues but allo to emhalm their names and\ memories but now it goes further perfon of any condition whar\ foever have he but as much money as the painter asks muft fit for\ his picture this is great abufe and fprung from as laudable cante.\ in noblemes indeed is very commendable cultom becaute be\ ing defcended from great families the luflre of thefe ought to thine to encourage their succeffors to keep up their glory and to prevent\ fullying it by unworthy actions.\ as for general of admiral who has died in the bed of honour gratitude think obliges us to raife monument to his glory and to animate brave souls in fucure times to imitate his virtue.\ but whats this to the vulgar pride only fpurs them to it the\ rich do it that their children may boaft of it the mafter of nume-\ jous family does it that the world may know he is father be\ who has fired magazine of the enemy muft be drawn with this\ great action tho perhaps there was no body to hinder him has ctizen wife but an only babe he is drawn at half vear old at\ ten vears old he fits again and for the laft time in his twenty fitth\ year in order to thew her tender folly and then the flands wonder\ ing how man can to alter in that time is not this weighty rea\ fon reproveable cultom if painters did not gain by it but portraits are allowable when lover is ablent from his miftrels that they may find each other their piltures to cherifh and increate\ their loves man and wife to parted may do the fame\ bit\ of portraiture.\ chap .\ to return to the original matter muft warn the artifts not to\ give in too much to what is common or humour ignorant people to\ much as not to referve to themfelves some liberty of doing what\ they think proper for the fake of reputation surely this can not be\ rrange advice for mafter who prefers money before art has no\ more dangerous rock to plit on lince the ignorant multitude ufually\ infiff to be drawn according to their own whims one fays to good\ matter \'97 draw me thus or thus let me have one hand on my breaft and the other on table another mult have flower in his hand or\ flower-pot mult be by him another muft have dog or other\ creature in his lap another will have his face turned this or that\ way and fome who would be drawn in the reman manner muft\ be fet off by globe or clock on table whether fuch ornaments\ be proper or not on mentioning the reman manner find that it\ fignifies loofe airy undress fomewhat favouring of the mode but\ in no wife agreeing with the ancient roman habit.\ but many other inconveniencies attend portraiture as firft the ig.\ porance of thofe who fit for fome of them having no right notion of\ their own mien and shape often refer the judgment of fine por-\ trait to the eye of child or servant and what they fay monficur\ and madame believe either to its praife or difcommendation.\ second inconveniency arifes from wedded inclination which any\ one has to fuch and fuch objects judging as they like or diflike not\ only of pictures but even the life wtelf for tho they may be\ afraid to pass sentence on fine hiffory or landskip yet por-\ trail mult not efcape them as thinking it within the reach of their\ capacities.\ thirdly we find many artifts never pleafed with other mers\ works but being full of themfelves delpife every thing they fee\ tho as good as their own and this perhaps on no better bortom than\ pique againtt the arciffs converlation talk dress or money or\ elfe becaule of his greater fame and yet if ten perfons happen to\ appland fine pilture of this eye-fore mafter they will at that\ juncture chime in with them to fereen their prejudice and on the\ contrary if but fingle perfon afterwards find fault they immediate-\ ly turn the tables againtl ten others again if piece of their\ friend be brought on the carper tho never to faulty they will ap\ pland and jullity it at any rate tho againft their own convictions of\ confcience but this partial and prejudiced humour is moft prevalent\ in thofe who know leall.\ fourth\ vii.\ of pertraiture.\ fourth set of men are thofe who being always of an uneaty\ temper diflike their own but appland every thing other men do thele indeed are not to noxious as the former becaute they only hure\ themfelves whereas the others hurt every body.\ fifthly there are prejudiced set of men who find no talle but\ in ealy and grave airs and poftures others in firring and hurrying\ ones others in ftrong and violent ones fome think that womens\ draperies ought to be loofe and foft others will have them of vel.\ ver or sattin or elfe parre-coloured this thinks that dark or brown\ ground beft fets off figure another chules landskip of green\ certain right or wrong are the colours beautifully cholen the pic-\ cure fmells of them are they broken they feem muddy and foul.\ how can portrait pleafe to many opinions it is not like an hiftory\ full of figures where we can introduce variety of fedate and firring\ action more or less beautiful colouring loofe or fet draperies dark\ or light grounds coc becaule this is but fingle figure.\ our bufincts then muft be to find way between this soylla and\ cbarybdis to enable the artiff to paint good portrait for he who\ makes due reffection on every thing can prepare himself to overcome\ the aforefaid difficulties\ ap ii of the defetts in the face and other parts.\ he defects which are feen in nature or in fimple life are\ threefold.\ natural ones.\ accidental ones.\ usual ones.\ the noturalones are wry face fquint eyes wry mouth nofe c accidental ones are loss of an eye cut on the cheek or ther part of the face pies of the small-pox and the like.\ the usual ones are thofe habits to which we accultom ourfelves\ from our infancy to wit contraction of the eyes and mouth of\ cloting of gaping of the latter or drawing it in fomewhat to this or\ that side upwards or downwards cec.\ as for other bodily infirmities how many have wry necks hunch-\ backs bandy-legs withered or thort rms of one chorter than the\ other of pertraiture.\ chap dead or lame hands or fingers among thefe some are una-\ voidable and others may be either left our or handfomely hidden.\ the neceffary ones ought to be feen becaute they belp the likeness tuch as wry face fquint eyes low fore-head thinnels and fatnels wry neck too fhort or long nofe wrinkles between the eyes ruddiness or palenets of the cheeks or lips pimples or warts -\ bout the mouth and fuch like among thofe which may be bidden\ or left out count blind eye wound wen mole pies of small-\ pox too many pimples coc red blue or hairy spot as allo\ habicual ulages fuch as hanging lips pinchings of drawings of\ the mouth and eyes.\ think allo that the common and usual dress of perton is great\ addition to likeness for no fooner is the dress altered but the look\ does the fame and thews itfelf either more or lets pleating and agree-\ able and thereby the perfon becomes more or less known to obvi-\ ate which advife the artiff above all things to get firft true like-\ ness of the face and paint it to the sitter satisfaction and then he\ may freely manage all the reft as he thinks fit and thereby get ho-\ nour and commendation fince the life itfelf in fuch drels can not any more alter.\ the painter should likewife dilcover and know as much as poffible the natare and temper of the perfon fitting and in what circum-\ rances lies his favourite pleafure that he may when fitting be en-\ certained with talk pleating to him and his air thereby kept fteady\ and ferene and his pofture natural and eaty avoiding every thing\ tending towards sorrow or frightful relanons for thefe are apt to\ ruffie the mind and to to difcompofe the face that it can not eafily\ be got right again but if the sitter himself do by his talk difco\ ver his own bent the painter ought to humour it to the laft whether\ it be jocofe or moderate without exaggeration of diminution yet\ with luch variety as not to prove tirefome and make the face al.\ ter he who can not thus manage and furnith out difcourfe will be\ the longer ere he hit the likeness some will even fit three or four\ times and each time with different air and were they to fit ten\ times fancy fomething new would still offer.\ another hindrance may be that painting-rooms are often hung\ with fuch finutty piltures as frequencly put virgins to the blnth or\ alter their countenances but tho for improvement fine pittures are\ neceffary to be always in view yet in painting room there ought\ not to hang the wanton pilture of mars and venus catch\'92 by vulcan of\ of poriraiture.\ vii.\ or diana\'92 bothing tho done by van dyk or feseph and potiphar'\ wife for tho thefe may hang in corner yet when the eye has\ once carched them it will retain them becaute their ideas make con-\ tinual impreftions on the mind even againtl its will and therefore\ the bare remembrance of fuch things muft put young and chafle\ virgin to the bluth mult it not create longing to fee picture of\ two besgar-boys fall greedily on ripe fruit the one eagerly biting piece of freth melon and the other bunch of grapes with the\ jnice falling down his chin on his naked breaft the room then\ should be hung with every thing modell as fine landskips and flow.\ er-pieces which will amufe the sight without difturbing or tiring the\ mind or altering the countenance fine portraits alfo will animate sitter to keep him ferene and make him emulous of their airs large lookingglats may be likewife of service if to hung that the\ sitter can fee himself in it for thereby difcovering any dilagreeable.\ nets in his look he will correct himself in order to have as good an\ air as he detires and by fuch methods as thefe painter may be.\ come great.\ we will now proceed to confider how many millakes fome painters\ commit in relation to the firff obfervation of natural defetts thefe\ endearour to their utmoft power to exprets punctually the deformities\ and defelts of face without scruple to wit blind of fquint eye or the like tho they know that tis an enemy to grace and on no\ other ground than falfe belief that it creates greater likeness\ but who loves to be reproached with his defects when they can be\ artfully hidden what would become of grace which reaches that painter should make as beautiful choice as poftible which thefe ble\ mithes obfcure think therefore that we cannor lay too great stress\ on what concerns the make posstion and turn of face that the eye\ be not offended with blemith or deformity or the posture look dify-\ freeable.\ how monlrous is the picture of certain admiral who seems to\ ftab himself with his staff of command and has defective eye turn\ ed directly to the light becaute according to the saying he is bet\ known by it would not more profile-view have fixted him better or to have fiung the side with the blind eye into shade would it not\ be ridiculous to paint the duke of lnxemburgh in profile to reprefent\ him the becter and that his hunch -back might be the more vifible for no other reaton than that moft people knew he had one natre\ of pertrailure.\ abhors deformity and we can not behold it without averfi-\ on and quick tun of the eye from it squint eyed perfon can not see himself in glass without inward trouble especially one of the\ fair sex who in other respects tolerably handsome can not bear to\ fee an laftance of her deformity in another but will bathfully look off\ or down to the ground how much worle then mult it look in pic\ ture the life may be fometimes feen on an handlome side which in an ill cholen picture we can never expect whence it natural for\ one who has blemith or defect in an eye or check always to turn\ the bell side to the light in thort we do not defire to do any thing walk fland fit talk but with becoming air have we fore eyes we hide them under our hlats or if lame hlip we endeavour to walk\ briskly have we some humour or pimples in cheek we either hide\ them with paich or paint the other side like it have we bad teeth we keep the mouth thut or lame hland and hide it not under our\ coats of in our pockets if naturealts fo how can fuch defects pleafe\ in picture such flartery then as is agreeable to art is not only\ allowable but commendable efpecially when the sitter is to dispoted\ in pofture that the painter himself can not perceive it.\ ask any one who wears piece of black silk over an hollow eve whether he defires to be drawn from that side believe not per-\ ton with wooden leg cares not that the deformity should appear in\ pilture fuchi an one ought to be drawn in half length only but if\ the heroe inift upon the introducing fuch leg on suppofition\ that is an honour to have loft limb in his country service the\ painter mult then comply with his defires or elle contrive it lying on\ table covered with red velvet if he defire it after the anique\ manner it muft be contrived in bats-relief wherein the occation af\ it may be reprefented or it may hang near him on wall with its\ buckles and straps as is done in hantingiequipages of elfe it may\ be placed among the ornamehnts of archirelture to be more in view but what praife or advantage will an arciff get by this when judi-\ cious mafter fees the picture he may verhaps plead in excute that\ the sitter would have it fo this indeed can not argue againft becaute\ we afually fay-to whom we employ .\'97do as would have you\ right or wrong we have an inftance of gentleman whe being\ drawn in little and comparing the smallnets of the eyes with his\ owa asked the painters whether he had fuch however in complaiy\ fatce and for his pleafare hei dtfired lacono eye ar ieall seight by\ as big as his owns the other idremain as it was ad tid eti py\ terable\ of portraiture.\ vii.\ ferable subjection for tho we can not compel others\ to be of our\ opinions yet piry thofe who mull fobmit to imongruities but not\ to difkearten the artiff too much we will proceed to\ iii the obfervables in pertrait particularly that of woman\ vel .concel tand selflove seem narural to all but efpe.\ cially to the female sex who whether their pictures are drawn\ on their own accounts or through the defire of others imagine\ ther deferve fuch homage nor ftops it here for altho they may\ poffess colerable share of beauty yet that not fatisfaltory enough they muff be ffaccered and their pictures painted in the moft beauti-\ ful light and unhappy is the painter who abates but half dram of\ fuch beautr.\ for thefe reafons the maffer is obliged to have principal regard\ to light and coloar but to the light chiefy fince its well known\ that mothing gives greater offence to ignorant people than shades and\ sill more when they are rrong and broad they believe they peak\ to the purpofe in objecting \'97 well how can it be poffible that my\ nock and check should have firch large shades when daily confult\ hiy glass and find my skin all ofa colour and white and they the\ painter is blained but are not fuch reafons weak and abfurd since\ if man how tenacious foever meet another who by long abfence\ and alteration of drefs is got ort of his memory he will naturally\ forn him to the light in order to know him and his features this\ condolt has been wonderfully obferved by baroces in his picture of\ mary paying vific to elizabert when big with child in which by\ his method of placing the figures and the accention of the faces we teem to hear them talk looking earneftly at each other.\ ithink thote mafters have hads the beft choice who have cholen\ frot-tgbs and thereby kepr their colours moft natural and beau\ tful fince this light is certainly moft advantageous whether the\ pilture hang againtt wall or where elfe but here feems to arife\ difficulry fnce we formerly faid that we eught to fix certain\ place and the point of right had diftance and failifpofe the light\ tyas it cha fall on that plnce to which the atwes is eaty for\ nac\ tails\ of portraiture.\ chap have no fixed place as we shall further thew in another chap\ ter as alfo how far and on what occafions we muft confine ourfelves\ to that rule.\ the beft way to fettle this point is to follow thole who have chof\ en their light almost frenting and as before faid such colour-\ ing as naturally appears to the eye belides good choice sincei chink\ the cafe of placing portrait to be the fame as that of curious cbi-\ ns which whether it fland high or low thew itself every where beau\ tiful my reafon for this is that objects which have fuch front-\ light have an exceeding fine effect and ear relief when they come\ againft dark ground and hill finer when the light falls on them\ somewhat from on high if the sitter and fome accidents do not hinder\ it in which cafe reafon and our eye mult beft direct us view\ but this finels in pofture painted leaning over an harch or out at\ window and what great decorum the touches and shades about the\ moft relieved parts caule in fuch an object as leonarde da vinci has\ well obferved.\ of the accidents which juft now spoke of shall mention two\ of three fome perfons may be too long and charp-nofed or too hol-\ low-eyed for fuch low light is moft proper but where tis other-\ wife an high light in this manner judicious mafter ought to help\ the defects of nature without adding to or taking any thing from\ them vet to the sorrow of impartial malters the contrary is too\ much feen for as have faid that hiffory-painters chule and follow\ what they have the greateft inclination for to it is with many portrait-\ painters their work is better known by their particular manner than the sitter by his picture.\ permit me here to make comparifon between thofe two great\ malters titian and van dyk with respect to the judgment have\ heard made on their works of the latter it faid that in the\ delign grace and choice of portrait figure he was the moft skilful nevertheless pye feen many of titians who in moft men opinions has the greater reputation which feemed to me incomparable tho'\ lets agreeable here my polition about the particular choice of\ mafters takes effect again becaute think that the defect in .\ greeableness is peculiar to titidn country and limits his choice and therefore he is the lels culpable when on the contrary our region prefers what is gay and elegant before the majeitic and\ grave and likeness is the chief object both of the sitter and the\ arciff every thing elfe being looked or as by-works and ornament poor\ v pertraiture.\ book vii.\ poor judgment methinks of people of senfel for if portrail have\ not befides likeness an agreeable difposition the little knowledge\ of the mafter will prefently appear iis true that we meet with ma-\ odd faces in the life especially among vulgar and clownith peo-\ ple yet fay that be they ever fo rude agreeableness should be ob-\ served in their piltures by fgreeubleness underftand the difposition.\ of posture in general as when the face has an advantageous turn\ more or lets to the light up or down in order to create handfome\ shades and to thun unbecoming ones for every face requires parti-\ cular obfervation one an high light another low one this side-light that an almoft fronting one fpeak not yer of many ther requifites fuch as the sway of the neck shoulders or breaff or of proper back ground all which confiderations are effential to fine portrait as well in respect to the naturalnets and colour as to the\ motion but of the light and back-grounds we shall fay more in the\ sext chapter and now return to our comparifon some think that\ von dyks pamtings are but watercolours compared with titians whofe pitures have to much force in colouring lights and shades that those of the other can not fland in compecition with them nay that his colouring is inimitable and whereby that of van dyf ap-\ pears faint and weak ridiculous opinion indeed however that\ vax dyk and tirian differ much in colouring allow but neverthe-\ tets think that we need not run to the iations to prove it fince if\ the stress lay in frong colouring only rembrant need not give way\ to titias but whence arifes the miltake moft men chime in with\ thofe fimple judges who

in tweet and agreeable manner.\ chap iv of the choice of lights draperies and grounds in pertrair and of the point of sight.\ nthe preceding chapterwe have laid down as rule that front-\ light is the beft to be chofen and the molt beautiful especially\ in the fair sex and think it the more necelfary when the face it.\ self is alfo refen in frent becaule then the greate force will fall di-\ rectly woin the mat rifing or relieved purts but thall now lubjoin that fince the life however we difpofe it either from or near the\ light fronting or in protile yer supports itfelf tho the light be not\ advantageouly cholen which portrait can not do we therefore mutt\ needs in order to make if appear as it ought to be accommodate the\ light to the disposicion of the face for lnftance when the face turns\ fomewhat fideways the light muft be adapted to it when it quite\ in protile side light will be best becaufe then great mass of light\ remains together to wit in the forehead nofe and cheeks which\ are not broken by any groundthade but united by the roundnets which thews us how to reprefent rifing narure and caufes becoming\ relief.\ we fee that manr without difference be the figure in full pro-\ portion or in lrtle give the touches under the nofe to black and\ dark that it teems as if black beetle were proceeding thence where\ asits certain and nature teaches it that when the light falls trong\ on the nofe the noffrils and their ground-hades can never appear and yet fome think they ve done great fears in uling force and\ strength and will do it even in fair and tender face and no bigget\ than\ of periraiture.\ chap the palm of the hand akcho the decpeft black should not have\ force enough to shade the other objects of darker colour fuch as\ hair cloak or other garment by which sort of management the\ face leems to jump out of the frame and to defert the wig hair and\ garment we mult not to underfland when we teach that the face\ mult have the main light we mean only that allought to keep due\ order that it may look narural each colour of the by-work ought according to it lightness or darkness to have it moderate shade and\ dark touches as the matter it contifis of is either folid or thin and\ tranfparent and in proportion as the objects leffen to mult the force\ of their colours diminith as shall be furcher illuftrated in the following\ chapter to which for brevity we refer we fee an excellent example\ of this management in the famous nelfcbers artful portraits wherein\ he has judicioutly handled the darkeff shades and -touches according to the natural ferce of the colour.\ for the better underftanding of further obfervables have found it\ proper to meation some other particulars concerning the dilpolition of\ lights according to occation contilling in light againft dark and the\ centrary and tho every thing thereby becomes relieved and is fee\ off yet that is not fufficient for the placing of colours againtt eachr\ other on suitable grounds and contraft in the objects whether move-\ able or immoveable is of great confequence and decorum and al\ tho we have handled thefe things at large in the book of colouring yet we find it neceffary to recapiculate them here with respect to por-\ traits and the reciring grounds or viftos behind them.\ obferve then whether fair and beautiful face will become light\ grey or lighrith blue ground and whether warm complexion and\ rrong colouring againtt glowing or yellowith ground will pleafe the\ eye fpeak of the face not the draperies tho both together make\ portrall but let the fair and beautifid fuce of woman be placed.\ againlt warm ground and then the light parts will not only be thereby\ fing off and look more agreeable but the shades willallo be foften-\ ed and appear more tender for it unnatural to force fair and ten-\ der virgin who thews little or no motion our of her feeming apart ment as fome by their glowing shades and rellexions have endeavour-\ ed to do whereby their faces on the shaded side look as if light-\ ed candle flood behind them which penetrated their skin this is as\ unnatural in the open air as within doors.\ this example of woman is enough to prove the contrary coadntt\ with respect to man face according to the aforefaid rules couch-\ ing\ of pertraiture book vii\ the dilpolition and placing of colours on tukable orounds famely that the ffrong ought to be painted againtt the weat and the arak .\ gaind the glowing and frong wherein is alfo comprehented hight againt\ dark and darkagaintl light\ whence its evident that back-grounds contribuce very much to the\ charming grace of objects nay idare fay that the decorum thoftly\ depends thereon and tho many imagine that dark of black grond\ always becomes portrait yet no rule fince as before has been\ laid each inlividaal coloar of the objetts requires particular back.\ groand belides it tuch things were to be taken for rules the rt\ would fmell too much of an handicrafe for dark colour againt dark ground can have no good effect and that of whice or pale gainft it will be too hard therefore medium mult be pudicioutly ob-\ ferved in bock that one colour may fuit with the other in the drage.\ ries the conduct is the fame one perfon beft becomes light and another dark cloths blue fuitsone and red vellow or green cc another the arrit muft then take care not to force nature but help her as\ much as poffible and reprefent her alwars moft begutiful.\ if any one would know my reafon for thinking that many errors\ arife in this part of the art it is that the colours of the nated receive\ more or lets or too much force by the by-colours of grounds and\ eackornaments it fares with them as it is laid of the camelion who\ changes his colour as often as he is placed by different colours tho this\ is occationed by his elegant and thining scales when contrarily the\ human skin is dull and not fhining however we shall find that he who paints portrait twice and each time on contrary ground yet\ with the fame temperament of colours will perceive very great nay incredible difference as have on feveral occafions experiment\ ed in the life to wit that when some virgins were in room hung\ with vellow they looked fickly and grey notwithflanding their freth\ colour but contrarily being in room hung with violet their co.\ lours thewed themfelves very beautiful whence it appears that the al.\ terations are offentimes occafioned by the adjacent objects let him who doubts this make trial of it in portrait by laying ground with watercolours on paper and after the face is cut out placing it\ againft the picture intlead of back-ground but think there is conveniet way of preventing the aforefaid lceration namely by\ fixing againft the wall behind the sitter garment cloth or fome\ thing elle of the fame colour of near it which we chufe for our bick-\ ground of pertraiture.\ thurrwe may be fire of hitting the right colour and make\ the painting look agresable\ in order to repreient an extentive back-ground and chieffy in small\ picture be it an apartment or landskip some sbadiness should be con-\ rived between the figure and the diltance as column curtain body\ of tree vale coc thete objects being in shade or of dark co-\ lour the lights falling on the off-works will not prejudice either the\ faceor drapery tho both be light but on the contrary the figure..\ as receiving the foremoll and greatelt light will thereby be relieved and look more agreeable.\ as for the drageries fince they confill of different and various co\ lours each of particular narure and little agreeing with the co\ lour of the face they alfo require each particular ground beft\ fairing and unicing with it to the end that tho differing among them.\ felves they may have perfett harmony with each other to that the\ eye be not taken alone with the face or the draperies ornaments.\ or by-works but by this fweet conjunction infentibly conducted alli\ over the pilture.\ it will not be improper to treat alfo about eafiness and sedarenels in polture opposed to stir and bultle and the contrary namely that\ the picture of gentlewoman of repute who in grave and fedate\ manner turns towards that of her husband hanging near it gets great\ decorum by soving and firring hind-works whether by means of\ waving treesor croffing archifecture of stone or wood or any thing\ olfe that the mafter thinks will belt controff or oppose the sedate po-\ sure of his principal figure and becaute thefe are things of conte\ quence and may not be plainly apprehended by every one hall ex-\ plain myfelf by examples in plare vil touching the elegance and\ harmony of back-grounds with the figures.\ in no reprefent beautiful face againtt the light of the\ ground and the drapery which is whice or of light colouring .\ gainl the dark of it thefe oppofitions thus meetig produce .\ weet nixture above and below an agreeable relief or kilino of the\ under part of the body whereas were it otherwife the face as\ but fmall part of the body would look too fharp and ditagrecable and the under part of the body would have no force.\ in no being the portrail of man of more warm and twaro\ thy complexion we fee the reverfe of the former becaute his co-\ lour and that of his drets are of different nacure yer the ground\ is very ornamental and each fets off the other.\ nes\ of pertraiture.\ vii\ no shews man with drunken face of red purple and vio\ let and fomewhat broun and darkiff which is fer off by white\ marble or light fione ground and gives it fine air.\ in no is an example of the contrall in off-works with the drg.\ perr of the figure frewing the oppofition of moveable objects with\ tixed ones for herein are leen rounding and croffing folds againtt\ and parallel off-works and\ in no appears the reverfe where the folds hang freight and\ mottly downwards and the off-works crots them.\ no gives us an example of the opposing action and polture of\ bodies in two fellow-portraits for the man being on the womans\ right side turns his face fidewars towards her his body is fronting receiving the light from the right side.\ in no we iee the contrary in the womans pofture her face is\ foreight and her body fways fideways towards the man the allo is\ lighted from the right side.\ the figures numbered and reprefent alfo yet in different\ manner the contrall in the motion for the woman flanding on the\ right side of the man has fedace motion and fet and hanging\ shoulders but the man contrarily is in an active motion and\ no shews proper method to exhibit great extent or seem\ ingly fuch in snall piece for the fioure ftands in firong light the by-ornaments curtain vafe pillar and walling are in shade and the oftskip or hind work is light again but fomewhat broke by\ resion of its diftance.\ to conclude this chapter shall fay fomething of the placing of\ pertruits and of their point of sight.\ as to the former its certain that when we fee any painted figure of object in place where the life can be expected as standing on the\ ground leaning over balcony or balluftrade or out at window c it deceives the eye and by being feen unawares caules fometimes\ pleaing miltake as it frightens and furprizes others when they\ meet with it unexpectedly at fuch places as aforefaid and where there\ is any litelifood for it if we are thus mifled by reprefentation of\ nature how great mull the mafter be who did ir the knowing\ eteem him igaorants cry him up if this be the cafe we ought to\ endeavour to follow narure and fclibood and principally to oblere\ the rules of perfpective for who can doubt that standing fitting\ of moving figure artfully painted and placed as aforefaid wll ao\ have the same effect as the life itfelf ikile\ of porirailure.\ .\ fience it follows that low herisons or points of sight are the beft\ and moft natural in portrait and will moft deceive the senfes if the\ light and diflance with respect to the place where the pitture is to\ be fet be well obferved otherwife the effect will be contrary to what\ we expected.\ this condult is chiefly necelfary in portraits hanging high for being\ to much above the eye they muft needs have low horizon butas\ portraits are moveable how natural and like foever they be and well\ handled if they hang not in proper places they will not have good\ effelt hence the mifchief attending them is that by continually\ changing their places they can not always be painted to certain\ height and diftance and confequently baffle our rule difficulty\ which the greateff mafters muft hruggle with and this branch of the\ art is lable to.\ having now thewn that low horizon and point of sight are beft and moft natural as fupplying in fome meafure this inconveniency\ how much muft they miltake who always chuse an high herizen they.\ are on level with the sitter and yet place the horizon many feet\ higher nay they think thofe who do otherwife all againlt nature\ and art some will have two points of sight in one piece one for\ the figure another for the ornaments one level with the eye and\ the other for the offskip one hand higher or lower at pleature or\ about or fingers breadth above the middle alcho\'92 thele are in=\ excutable errors yet think it vain to attempt their redrels but\ hope the judicious artill will weigh what have faid and endeavour\ to avoid them.\ ap of pertraits in little.\ are many things as have formerly thewed which if we will have them tranfport the senfes by their natural re-\ prefentation we muft always exhibit in their natural proporti-\ on and force of colouring but in portrait it is otherwife for this\ may as well be done in little as in full proportion provided the dis\ minution be well obferved and befides it has some relation to biffe.\ rical management we could fay the fame of litle flower comvared\ with great one for if it were coloured in proportion to its dillance\ and diminusion if would be in the same cafe with fortrait in lif\ it pertraitire.\ boek vir\ but ics neverthelets certain that in feffoerns garlands flower.\ poes in niches groups of flowers coc ferving for ornament of\ chambers lirle flowers are of fmall ccount nay never feen wore\ or embroidered in any stuff whence some may be induced to think that portrair in little as big as the paim of an hland has as litle\ property in square againtt the wall espectally when it receives its\ light from witheut the frome and is bandled with as much force as the\ life imjelf which with respelt to force allow nevertheless small\ portrait may in order to make it look more nacural be more eafily\ helped than fnall flowers placed againft door window or other\ flat which in my opinion can in no wife be made good but small portrail may as shall prove in what follows in order to\ which the artiff mull previoutly contider firlt how much the life in proportion diminishes and confequent\ iy how fsint it mutt be.\ secondly that the pitture can not receive its light from without the\ frome as being too fur from it.\ here perhaps it may be asked whether portrait of lady or\ genrleman teaning our at window in the manner of ofd mieris her tender acer and others would not be good and natural ly ves but then the window muf alfoge back for as it would be\ difficult to reprefent its going back from the frame fince no object whether cieting or floor coc is between them in order ta creats\ diffance and make the piture fall back formeching may be incro-\ duced in full prepartion to skew the depth and diffance according\ to the difference to be feen in the following inftances in plite\ iviii.\ in no.. we fre common fank in the figure teaning on the\ frame in this there is no other way to make the figure go back than by taking swar the frame and attho\ na shews itself within the frame yet it would be to no pur-\ pote did we not altign sufficient large breadth or tbirkness to the\ froms for in fixh cafe we muft not feoard dn hands breadih of\ eott whereon to reprefeat fomething in sitt pronerfidt as sh orange .\ book e fet\ no shews good nethod and in iidoment thre beft and\ moff natwal\ have\ xthember amongft

sill of the window next the window\ maidfervant was feen flanding at the door speaking to wo\ man in the street with child in her arms some other figures\ appeared in the front of the picture feen to the shoulders\ only as if flanding in the street on the sill of the window\ were lying bortom of blue worfed ftuck with needles alle\ pair of sciffors piece of dark bine cloth and thimble all in full proportion to be thort this picture was by an artifl with the owner leave fentenced to be dockt in order to which he\ drew square chalk-line round the window which contained the doc-\ cor and cut away all the reft round about it hitting here an head there an arm without paring any body but the doltor who was in\ rantly put into fimaller frame thus the piece was half cut away and for no other reafon as the artift pretended than that the docior\ alone was fufficient to fatisfy the eye the reft being fuperfinous wretched fate for to good picture but fome painters will keep the\ old read becaute is difficult to cerrect reoted evil they de asthe\ old womandid who being exhorted in her laft sickness to embrace the\ true faith antwered she would follow the steps of ber fore-fathers were they all gone to the devil.\ so it is with portrait in little which has nothing of nature but\ the features and looks like puppec whereas there are well-known\ methodsto make it appear as big as the life nay to move and fpeak as\ may fay but being llighted the figure feems immoveable dumb and\ little and therefore unnatural.\ on this footing mean to thew that all things may be naturally\ reprefented in lttle except moon light which baffies all our\ skill\ now if it be asked whether too nice an exprestion of parts in fmall portrair would not be fuperfiuous and unnatural with respect to\ diltance and whether lets fimthing would not be better fay no provided it be not to flrong and warm as the life for the figure not\ being exhibited in open freld it can not have to much miflinets and\ vapour about it and therefore the neat fencilling cannor be obftruc-\ tive elpecially if managed with skill as the principal parts well\ touched and the render and melcing smallnefies in the broad parts the\ same to that at the proper diftance the one is feen more and the thef less here may afife another queffion whether firxh pictures are not of\ the fame nature with what\ is teen thro prospective-glals fincs every\ thing\ portraiture.\ book vii.\ appears to plain elaborate and neat but antwer that they\ are not nor can becaute the glats exhibits the life without the inter-\ potition of miftiness or vapours and with firong and warm shades which overcome its smallnels\ have often wondered at fuch fmall paintings becaute they feemed\ as if was looking in nuremberg looking-glats or thro prospective fince they appeared not like the life but little moving puppers.\ now another difficulty is that fince fuch paintings can not ac-\ cording our policion be made good without the addition of some\ by-ornament as lmagery in whole or half figures vine-branches bout the frame or tomething lying on it in order to sing them of it\ would be hard for thofe who canonly paint whole or halffength fi-\ gure and ain at nothing elfe than to become mafters therein where\ as he who is better verted may by due obfervance of what has\ been faid eafily overcome the before mentioned difficulties.\ ap vi of the application of requisites with respect to the\ different conditions of persons.\ will not be foreign to our main delign to put the artiff in mind\ of the application and right ule of luch materials as may enrich portrait and make it look the more noble this is to great point in portraiture that when well known we need never be at standthro the mishape or defects we often meet with in the dispoliti-\ on of portrait and which fometimes mult not be hid fince we have\ always mieans enough for obviating them with feeming reafon and\ withour forcing nature as long and narrow face may be helped by an\ hood or other head-drets thick and too round pace by the con\ trary figuretoo lonefome may be embellished with pillar pedettal flower-por table and fuch things as are proper to it which ferre\ not only for ornament and grandeur but allo to express the sitters\ luffre and virrue but care mult be taken that the figure of the sit\ ter as the principal object of the piece fill up the major part of it either by preading sway of the polture or by the addition of some\ proper by-work by which means it will have good effect.\ since certain that the vices as well as virrues have two power\ ful qualiries and tho contrary to each other yer both tend to good\ purpole nay wicked perfon may by virtuous example be relcved\ from\ of pertraiture.\ chap evil and virfuous perfon thro had example led into error\ and ruin but virtue being joined to virtue fearsno evil contrarily the evil will make us avoid evil so pictures should create an ardor\ for virtue and especially thofe of religious and good perfons fince\ this as we have faid in chap gave the firft rife to their reprefen-\ lations in order to perpecuate their memories as well as their virtues\ and glorious actions.\ to

may engage in it and fubjoin fomewhar of\ copying pictures in the fame bignels as well as in different sizes.\ find that this imitation of mafters is less oblerved in their deligh\ and ordonnance than in the colouring lights and shades this is\ certainly principal pont in picture becaute there tan be he dect.\ rum without it ay we find fome works of lmall mafters in this par\ no vii.\ of portraiture.\ tolerably fuccetsful tho they know not how they got the\ knowledge it happening moftly by chance they are charmed\ with some fine and taking colours in this or that great mafter thefe\ they ule at random in their own productions either forwards or in the\ depth middle or sides and if they happen to be placed againtt proper ground or are fer off by any aiding by-colour the work his\ right in farisfying both the eye and rules of art but if thefe\ fine colours happen not to fuit the grounds then all is wrong and\ the arriff at fland.\ to explain this point we shall be more particular and clear it by\ examples tho think have already in this book fpoken largely\ enough of it in treating of back-grounds and the harmony of co-\ lours in portrait certain arcift having feen very beautiful\ whice and green lace on young lady gown painted by great\ mafter he mull by all means imitate it butbeing asked whether\ he had taken due notice of the groundcolour of the gown he\ antwered \'97 no \'97 how then can this fine and becoming lace\ have good effect in his works unless by chance the reafon of\ which is think that either through shame or pride or both the\ arciff takes fomething from great mafter for inftance what he\ uted in the lointain the other that it may not be known brings\ forward and what he has reprefented in the open air the other\ poor method of concealment fince\ contrives in dark room.\ by right application the thefe would be lawful but tis fuch mens\ misfortune to be in this particular moft out of the way when they\ think they do beft for wanting the great malters wit judgment\ and apprehention they have no true notion of his conduct and\ therefore are eafily mifted and like kjop\'92 raven expoted to cen\ fure.\ since tis an undoubted truch that we can perform nothing but\ what paffes through thought and of which either by feeing of\ hearing we get an idea therefore muft the paintings drawings and\ fine prints of old mafters give an handle to thoughts and praltice for he who never faw lion can never paint him well unless by\ the help of draught or model as was the cafe of certain weft\ pbaliss who reprefenting duniel in the lion den and having never\ leen lion he painted hogs inflead of lions and wrote underneath be this fable or truth it howe\ these hould be lions.\ ver teaches us that we can not reprefent any thing

knowledge and thoughts from which\ they draw the things which judgment effeems ufeful and service-\ able.\ iam of opinion that two great advantages arife from copying\ great malters works the one is that therein we fee many defelts\ of fimple nature corrected by their skill and judgment and the other that by this means we accuftom ourfelves to rectify thofe defells.\ when we have nature before us truly two points of great im-\ portance.\ but alasl is an artiff confidered in his natural inclination other\ wife than child which advancing in age follows its impulfe if\ he perform one praife-worthy act how many errors will he contrari-\ ly commit but when this bent is condulted by reafon and art the\ perceptions of the mind will then as thro clear channel flow\ pure and undefiled which leads me in some meafure to confels that\ art and praltice have great advantages and are more to be fer by\ than all we receive from narure which is often defective in defired\ perfection in fingle object but the is perfect in her performances\ and objects in general and in that senfe art is obliged to follow\ her wherefore with the philolopher mult fay of arcifts\ natura incipit ars dirigit experientia decet.\ that is nature points out the way which arts improve and settlel prattice makes pifture move.\ heace we may eafily perceive what we should do to cure this great\ defelt of the mifule of other mien works but that may be the\ better underffood shall infiff on further means for doing it if then\ it happen that the arriff meet with any thing which is very taking and he be defirous to make it his own whether fine colours drapery stone coc let him take notes in his pocket book of the ground by-\ colours and other incidents as what there is about luch or fuch colour.\ and

exhibit in an open\ air.\ the like heedles miftake we fee in the copies of many dilciples\ and young matters after old or modern paintings for not obferving\ whether in lettening their copies which they generally do they\ should not ahfo abare in strength of colour and tints their colouring as well in light as shade is as flrong as the original the same er-\ for they commit in painting great copy after fmall original but\ this ill conduct is owing chiefir to mafters when they fet their pupils\ to copy in different size in not admonithing them of it but rather\ defiring that ther shall imtate every thing as exactly as poffible tho'\ in falt it be againtt the rules of arc tis therefore certain that picture with figures or landskin fuppole it as big as the life to\ be copied third fots in size the tints in the copy mult needs be third jainter than the original and the more it lesfens in size the\ finter the tints or elfe it cannor be good if this conduct be of fuch\ moment in copying pictures of how much greater confequence mult\ it be when portrait-painter diminithes the life or paints portrait\ in full proportion from small one with respect to the weakening or\ hrengthening of colours.\ alcho\'92 irs commendable to follow great mafters in general yet irs to dwell upon tome of their particulars as an ornament un vafe term coc withour friving at fomething new we think that what\ ther have done is enough for our practice but this is weakness fince are and nature have fuch fund of objects and our time for\ hearning and living is long enough and by confulting within ourfelves\ we may pir our genins.\ others commit the fame fault by contrary impulfe for to vio-\ lent is their inclination to some particular great mafter in his objects colouring cor that they think in loff time to employ their thoughts\ on the works of any other good rriff and being thus wedded to\ him they with drudge and plod to be like him as well in errors as\ perfections by this means and by puntual imitation of blunders\ and miftakes it fometimes happens that the copy and the original\ are not to be diffinguithed both being to wonderfully like each other pay their own productions

be good this would\ be ridiculous tis true an houfe mull have thefe properties but tis\ idle to think that therefore we can not judge of the building by the\ ourfide only as if the perfon who is able

whether the floors muft be wooden or stone or whether pa-\ lace is for its largenets more beautiful than common of citizens\ houle but waving other mea opinions we shall proceed in our purpole to far as concerns painter in thefe countries and no further our\ judgment is that the bed proportion in building is one chird higher\ in rife than breadth especially if it be covered in with compats\ roof

the walling is\ thickeff and is ufually finished with rafic order they mull be\ square and above either scheme little rounding or flat and thus\ the\ of architetture.\ viii\ the one thews the other with respect to roundacts and squarencts if\ now there were compass-windows in the bafement and upper stories the uppermoff should be circular and the undermoff oval with their\ longeft diameter

where tis over square window.\ as for doors over each other fay that if there were over\ the cornice compats-pediment and on both sides bullultrade\ with figures then the balcony-door ought not to be

subject to more inconveniencies of ran hail and\ if ind and if tlanding in damp places their ettect in few vears libly appears if the stones be not very hard by the droppinz of\ mouldings and

thewing the\ stones of buildings and their veining and eyeing when they are judi-\ cioully and agreeably difpoted according to rule fay it is commend.\ able to him who underflands perspective.\ the parts of buildings witein which are not to subject to the teeth\ of time are not foapt to decay as thole without the cementallo latis\ longer which makes them keep clean and intire their joints to seem\ almoll invitible and the whole to be as one stone for this reafon\ architedure.\ viii\ we muft aroid the mistakes of some painters who vein and eye their\ work and afterwards divide it into stones whereby one vein or eye\ happens offentimes to run through two or three stones at once whence\ we muft conclude it to be what it is meer painting and not the life whereas think it the moll certain way firft to divide the work\ into stones and then to marble and eye them obferving that each\ stone have particular eye to thew the difference between the casusl\ drepfing and the maibling.\ marble buillings have beautiful effect when the architecture is\ fine and well ornamented and this as well in painting as the life orderly dispofition is one of the belt reafons thereof without which\ it can not have that vall agreeablencts.\ knowing archrell takes especial care of the fetting the stones\ of his building in fuch manner as to blazon its beauty and improve\ it and thereby creare

of the picture by art which nature wants\ not as being round of herfelf wherefore it would look ill that the\ moft dark of the eye-veins come on the weaker parts becaute it\ would render the effect you propoted abortive.\ imagine piece of walling divided into three pannels on each\ side of which fland two columns the two firtt ought to oppofe each\ other their veining muft either be level or run

landskip who make ufe of buildings and other brick-\ work to few exhibit whole and highly-finished ones all they thew is ruins broken walls and decayed stones but feldom intire and per-\ feet structures becaute as take it theyll be at no trouble to fearch\ antiquiry for the forms and molt beautiful parts of archirelture whereby they might learn to produce fomething curious supinity\ proceeding from their want of knowledge and ambition to obtain\ ii.\ altho many think that piece of ruins does not require to great\ regard as an intire building they are much miftaken for the one\ as well as the other depends on meafure and proportion ver some\ will go and throw down part of building and intermix with it\ some fragments of capitals pieces of frizes corices and the like of an order foreign to the building which tho very wrong they\ salve by fuppoling that when building is in ruine no one will have\ the curiofity to examine the rubbith to fee whether there be wrong\ capital frize or cornice and granting fuch were to be found the\ fault would be none fince thofe broken parts might be brought thi\ ther cafually but this is lame excule to fpeak the truth ican\ not apprehend how

againft the af\ faults\ of architecture.\ of our entmiea by enenies endeamouring to bind yr we under\ hand buman inclinations and the fire of concupifcence when now thro frailty we are feduced by this delilab those corrupt affections whereby the lult of steep overpowers us and we flumber in her laps\ right reafon becomes ufeless and we ceafe to do good thus we are\ fhorn by the wiles of women that is by means of voluptuousness ws\ are deaf to the impulfes of the spirit and then of courle he open to\ our enemies both to fcorn and cruth us for worldly affairs are fo\ affelting that they have no

contrition gradually recover our hair and thereby our strength and then dying to sin we at once over\ come both ourseives and our enemies.\ the hair cut off allo implies the weakness of the faculties of the\ soul or spirit or even death itself.\ earipides reltifies that alceffus could not die before mercury came\ from heaven to eat off his hair mines likewife could not overcome\ king nisus unlels

thirdly becaute we can not duely view the work as long as tis on\ the eafel whence lattly le follows that the malter is always in pain for the effect\ of the painting in being fixed in its place.\ thefe difficulties are not little vexatious even to one who un-\ derflands his buliness for tis otherwife with thofe who make more\ ule of their hands than heads that is who work without founds-\ tion tho thefe ought to be more careful than others paint as many\ cielings as you pleafe as long as you do not believe that there\ are grounds and rules for it and remain in this ignorance you will\ never furmount the aforefaid difficulries the most skilful mafter is\ often at lots in this part of painting let us then in the first place learn perspective and what it fhews us fince thereby only we may\ arrive at this laudable study which otherwife is impoffible.\ ch ap iii of foreshertening objects in cielings.\ is obvious that the offskip in common picture is the part\ which retires or goes off

think myself obliged here to propofe to the artiff fmall prac\ tice of my own inveation and in my opinion of little trouble but\ great advantage to cieling- painters fince we find that altho there\ are certain rules yer they can not be put in ule without the greatelf\ trouble application and loss of time unless aided by some prac\ tice or other or by fome artful intrument like affronemy which how demonftrative foever has its globe and aftrolabe archiretture iis plan and level geometry the oval triangle square and com\ paffes mathemsties algebra cc but to return to my inven\ tion\ firft mould some wvax-puppers as we have fhewn in the chap\ ter of ordennence as big and as many as think proper next take\ as many pointed wires some long others thort whereon to flick the\ puppers and keep them from bending whether they be made fland\ ing lying flying or ficting this being done itake an oblong wood\ ch\ cielings or piafonds.\ chap trough lined with tin of what bigness think proper

the aforefaid wired puppers and fo as they may tun eality then fill the trough with clay or kneaded bran and thus my\ machine is in readinels now when make ufe of it flick my\ puppets bent and turned according to my delign on the wires and\ thro the holes into the clay where would have them one high another low one flooping forwards another leaning back coc as\ the subject requires which will then

can give\ the machine fuch light as defire either from side froncing or\ from on high common sun-hine or candle-light.\ now for perfecting this sketch and conveniently painting afcer\ it fet my layman with fuch dress as each figure requires in\ the manner before laid down and then my cloth being ready proceed to painting.\ invented this machine in the vear and put it in ufe for -\ bout years with great advantage and wich fuch exact refleltion that afterwards had no further occation for it tho never ufed more\ than or at moft puppets.\ now the curious artill mult alfo know what obfervations made\ in the ufe of the machine.\ firfl as plate xiii fhews put one puppet coming direfity down quite extended namely with head and feet both on line and then\ oblerved that there was not the leaft foreshortening all the partshav-\ ing their full lengths.\ second puppet fet apright fanding in profile on one side of\ the point of sight and found it foresportened in all its parts.\ third ler fying upwards from behind forwards and perceived that the members foreportened fomewbat more than these of the first and somewhat less than those of the second.\ fourth placed fitting with its upper-parts upright the thigbs\ parallel and the legs like the upper-parts and obferved that when it\ was quite in profile the upper-parts and legs foreshortened and the\ thigh kept its full lengtk as it alfo did when in frent-posstion..\ ix\ of the paintinge made firm imprestion of thefe things in my thoughts had no further occafion for that method.\ we shall now tay fomething vil of the colouring of fying figures.\ er ein we mull obferve that in cieling-painting tis the\ tame as in landskips firfl we rub in the greateft light of\ the sky then all parts about it next the higheff and moff\ faint objects and then the lower and more near ones and in cale balluftrade be reprefented it muft be the laft the reafon of this\ have thewn in treating of the deadcolouring of hifferies and land\ skifs.\ moreover as in fine landskip the sky principally governs all\ things and without it no proper diftance can be given to the pic\ ture to is the fame in cieling-piece with figures fying thro the\ air for is impostible to make objects rife unlets they have some\ communication with the air nor is it enough for objects going\ off higher or further from us to be painted fainter and faimter as in\ drawing or print but the colour mult alfo be thewn and as the\ air is coloured to muft the objects partake of it mean in their\ stides for if the fir be blue yellow or red the sbades ought like\ wile to have mixture of blae tellow or red\ as to the light of the objects we mult obferve that of what\ colour foever it be it breaks and grows darker as it goes off even were the air as may fay snow-white it breaks by diftance or\ air interpoting the red becomes violet the vellow greenith and\ the violet bluc as the objects go off from us and approach the\ air they are darkened white becomes darker pale aellow the\ fame and to on in other colours.\ something fill remains to be remarked with respect to objects in\ the air viz that fince the air communicates light from all parts the broad shades can not poffibly be to dark as in landskip or other\ piece but contrarily the dark touches will be to much the fronger all that is in shade ought to be lighter and feen more plain yet\ fomewhat less than in the light muft be likewife known that\ round objects have no surface especially on the shaded side that is to\ fay the our line againft the sky ought to unite and vanith not quite\ fcum\ cielings or plafonds.\ chap away but made fomewhat lighter on the edge as we\ have clearly demonfirated by the example of globular body book chap implying that fuch works in the air differ from\ others to wit that the objerts againff the sky are mere reanding and\ going of.\ vill general observations in painting the cielings of\ halls galleries cc.\ firff and principal obfervation on thefe occafions is that\ the quality and regulariry of the architefture be firmly prefer-\ ved in all its parts.\ the second obfervation concerns the grandear of the architecture as being the main matter painting in this cafe is only to be con-\ fidered as an aid to accomplith it with lets charges wherefore fuch\ care mult be taken that the painter deligns do not marr thofe of\ the architelt but that both unite in fuch wianner as to induce the\ eye to take every thing for truth irfelf.\ by the firff obfervation that the rchitelture ought to preferve its\ regularity we give to underfland that the structure of the room\ muft chieffy be regarded by the painter in his cieling pieces to as\ not to be hurt by making openings where they ought not to be for its\ not allowable to make them every where as big or litle as we pleafe the cieling must remain cieling ll that is withour the painting as\ the summers ought to have their proper thickneffes and be latting and not feem as tumbling which yet thro heedleffnels fometimes\ is the cafe for inftance let us fuppose the cieling to be divided in-\ to three pannels lined with cloth one next to the windows the fe\ cond in the middle over the chimney and the third to be next the\ wall that in the middle is between two summers one foot in and\ the two side ones hie almoff ffuth with the under parts of thofe sum\ mers now if the two side-cloths be like the middle one adorned\ with sky and the thicknels of the summer which is one foor not\ painted on the cloth the cieling on thofe sides is to much weak-\ ened or at lealt seems to be so and is beavier in the middle contrary to\ architelture whereas to make it look natural and according to or-\ der the ponderolity muft in this cale be on the sides and the\ middle part lighteff that it may not feem to be falling on our heads.\ the painting of\ book ix.\ we ought to observe that there muftt be but one open.\ ing and that in the middle fince there is but one point of sight and but one place of flanding to view the work to advantage.\ as for painting the thicknets of the summer only faid it to\ rectify miltake often committed when cieling is made alt over\ oxin and intlead of covering nothing is left but grate which\ can not be juftitied some think if may pats for lantern but\ they are much mittaken for lintern rifes and cieling lies\ far moreover the whole cieling can not ferve for lantern becaute\ of the windows in front the principal or middle piece mult predo-\ minare and of contequence be open and the others closed mean not\ to have any sky of living creatures but bass-reliefs foliage com-\ parrments of flowers all of fuch colour as fuits with the apart-\ ment this judge to be the firtl and principal care and study of good cieling-painter before he fets about the work for in the divi\ of cieling it is as with diamond the largelt and moft valua-\ ble is fet in the middle and round it the less and less.\ as to the second obfervation that the art of painting is aiding to\ -mecture and enrickes it at less expence the point is plain wherefore thail proceed to thew the reaton why the one may fpoil\ the other.\ in painting divisions it aften happens that the summers have not\ proper rets to he on especially when the cieling is covered all over\ and the summers hid with fingle cloth and left to the judgment\ of an ignorant painter who then without confideration divides it\ into or more pannels and thefe parted by painted sum\ mers which do not bear on any thing now to prevent this you\ mull let each summer reft on discharger pilafter of cartouche as\ architelture reaches for laftance were you to divide the two pan\ nels next the windows and wall each into two parts in order to\ have four pannels this would be improper and againtt archifecture becaute of the flamels over the window unlels it were compals\ headed and then it would not do withour cartouche.\ if it be asked whether the dirisson be painters buliness fay ic is to far as he underflands architecture otherwife more proper\ for an archifect at leaft may be eafily done with his affillance.\ as to the work where the painting may diforder or be contrary\ to archirecture it lies in the deligns when they do not fuit the\ building nor perfecily bear on foundations or have their proper\ weight by the foundation of the puinting mean the pariment and\ cielings or plafonds.\ chap by the weight of the defign that what the painter intends to ex-\ hibit in his cieling-piece be not too heavy and teem to press down the\ under-parts the better to clear my meaning will luppole room\ to be feet quare now if second depth or upper room were to be reprefented the piers columns doors and windows\ thereof muft needs accord with thofe of the under room and bear\ upon them and in the next place the courfe of the orders ought\ exactly to be obferved as architelture teaches that is to fay the\ beavieft muft be undermeft firft the tuscan next the doric then the\ jonic next the roman and laftly the corinthian and to upwards\ lighter and lighter which think is feldom obferved and the rea-\ fon is becaute the figures are fometimes reprefented bigger ihan the\ life which neceffitates the artiff to proportion his by-works accord\ ingly an unpardonable error and not at any rate to be juttitied but shall fay more of this on another occation and now purfue our\ purpofe in cielings principal point is that the work rife and\ that its force unite with the life that is that the objects in the low-\ ell parts be not painted fronger than the fixed work as compart-\ forethort-\ ments bafsreliets and other ornaments which not being\ ened receive their light thro the windows now it may be asked whether in cale we were to reprefent an apartment above with the\ same light as below the force of light and shade muft not be the\ same and fay it ought not becaule of the great difference between\ them as we may caily fuppole in two columns fet over each other receiving their light from one front the one from the undermoft and\ the other from the uppermoll windows here the upper bale muff\ have no more force than the under capital for were it otherwile it\ would seem to be nearer it would alfo not rife and confequently over-\ power the life tis here as in fine landskip where the fore-\ ground has the greateff force and the lecond and third are lels and\ tainter in proportion as they go off it is the fame with fying fi-\ gures for the light weakens by their riling and the shades become as well as in room by the lurrounding air weaker and fainter but the touches and shades keep their force.\ we have obferved what is necellary to the stability and regularity\ of the rchirecture with reipect to painting to that boch may teem\ to be one body as we thall exemplity by the following fable out of\ ovid proposed here as painter like simile.\ sulmacis and hermaphreditus two acomplith\'92 and agreeable\ puinting.\ young people introduce reprefenting aichitecture and\ salmacis.\ of\ of the painting\ book ix.\ meeting hermapbroditus and imagining her happinels lay\ in the poffeffion of to beautiful an object falls in love with him but finding repulfe the invokes the aid of the gods and thereby\ obtains her earneff suit the young man not daring to refift the\ will of heaven gives up the caufe and is by mercury whom we\ mud obterve here to be opfres joined to her and thus of two bo-\ des is made one further applications are needlets fince the simile\ fufficienly explains itfelf.\ now to continue our subject the following obfervables are at\ the beginning of the work chiefly neceffary.\ the condition of the place.\ the quility ofice and inclination of the owner and what\ subjects are proper trereto whether hiffories fables cec.\ the dispeftion of the subjects.\ how the subject is to be divided.\ firtt by the condition of the place mean the light of the\ room and in what manner it takes the cieling allo into how many\ pannels the archirect has divided the cieling and which is the prin\ cipal that we may adapt our thoughts thereto in the dispofition\ of the reprefentations as well as in the execution of them.\ seconlly by the quality cc of the owner we mult underfland wherner he be dirine or lawyer pholofopher or artifan and\ whether ke incline to piricual or moral general or particular repre\ fentations that is fuch as relate to him or his family in particular or generally to any who may live in the houfe after his deceafe ac\ cording to which information we ought to chufe subjects fuitable.\ thirdly how the subjetts ought to be disposed namely what mult\ be placed above in the air wherein as is faid lies the soul of resz-painting and what below as touching the body of it this we\ divide into spiritual and meral spiritual all that is governed by\ heaven and moral every thing that is directed by our judgment.\ fourchly how the subject is to be divided here the principal\ piece in the middle muff thew either the caufe or rife of the story or the efect of it the next to it mult exhibit the matter itfelf and\ that further off an appendix to or inference from it but to make\ this point plainer thall give an example.\ in the middle pannel place solemon before the ark of the covenant praying to ged for wifdem and on each side reprefent furrounded\ with glory the gifts which god beftows on him as wifdom and rick\ es flowing doxn and in the leffer pannels exhibit in bals-reliet the\ cielings or plafonds.\ this foot we may handle any thing or\ the corporeal virtues.\ subject whatfoever and by having due regard to the aforefaid four\ particulars and well executing them fuch reprefentation will cer.\ cainly pleafe every one even envy itfelf.\ hence we may fufficiently perceive how orderly we mult manage wherefore tis no wonder that to few excel in cieling-painting tho'\ it have rules as well as other studies but if thefe be not duely ob-\ served we can not gain the point he who fets up for good mafter muft thew that he underftands his art.\ if am asked whether think correggio cortond vovet and -\ thers who performed wonders in this branch have always to puncty-\ ally followed the rules and fo nicely regarded all the obfervacions\ here laid down according to my apprehention antwer that it\ would have been better if they had done it or elfe what fay mult have thewed in foregoing chap be owing to the machine with\ puppets which made ule of for or vears and afterwards laid\ alide for we ought firft to have thorough knowledge of thing and then demonttrate it but am further of opinion that had the\ great mafters perfectly known the prefcribed rules we should not\ find fuch great miltakes in their works as some now think there are.\ nevertheless its moft certain that none are qualified for this judgment but thole who have made it their practice for he who underftands\ the rules and retains them in memory can always judge whether\ they be obferved or not tho not able to do it himfelf vet they\ who work only by guels and know nothing of grounds and rules.\ are more pardonable than thofe who are acquainted with them and do\ not ufe them tho both blame-worthy the one for his carelessness\ and neglect of learning and the other for his knowledge and neg\ lelt of uling it.\ am very fenfible that fome will make little account of many\ things by me delivered as neceffary but am in no pain for that if\ can but give satisfaction to curious reader.\ mull own that in my juvenile vears dawbed some cie-\ lings but never flatter\'92 myself that underffood the art to as ought becaute was then ignorant that there were any certain grounds\ and rules.. neverthelets afterwards attained them by fomctimes\ hearing others difcourfe about them and by the rules of perspective and by my own indefacigable applicacion to to noble study info-\ much that at laff could sketch large and grand compolition with\ more\ of the painting of\ book ix.\ certainty and less trouble than formerly little one mutt on this occafion relate what courfe took.\ had in my room little jurty clolet and when was to make\ an ordonnance pinn\'92 my paper againtt the upper part of it and having candle in one hland and crayon in the other laid my.\ felf on my back and fcrarch\'92 my thoughts on the paper thisl\ found to be good method for preventing miltakes mean in the\ sketch now for the painting it allo did it againft the cieling yet not after fuch flight scratch for having made my sketch our of the prints of povet and others fuch actions and poltures\ as were proper altering them either in the faces hands or folds\ of draperies more or lets by guess as well as could thus made thift yer all was done againt the cieling whereby you may\ judge what trouble had as well in finding things as afterwards\ in executing them which really was double work but when better\ informed fat commodioutly at my eafel he who proceeds with\ certainty has great advantage above others.\ ix mched for drawing foresportened buildings figures trees cc after the life.\ ce commonly happens on nature denying her faroura-\ lo ble affittance that we have recourfe to our wits for means to\ tupply the defect it was even my cafe in cieling-painting af\ ter having given myself much trouble to no purpofe and taken ufe-\ lets pains in order to delign every thing after the life at laft found\ out the following mechod which has made me full amends tis\ very profitable in all pieces with low horizons as you will perceive\ in the uic.\ suppote then for intance that am to make delign of the\ stadt-houle at amgerdam tis no matter if it were thrice its prefent\ heighe and this without looking up chule station or diftance of\ eight feet more or lets from the building as occafion requires.\ then take convex looking-glats of about foot diameter bought at the auremberg toy-thops and place it againft the intide\ of my drawing-board or porto-folio contrive it in fuch manner that it may either sland upright or leaning back according as would\ fee things either from beneach or higher thus approach with\ the\ cielings or plafonds.\ to.\ the open porto folio and my back towards the object till the build\ ing tree coc appear as would have it and then delign it from\ the looking-glats on white or blue paper.\ this method is very convenient for drawing all sorts of large\ works in narrow places or streets even view of twenty or thirty\ houfes tis alfo ufeful to landskip- painters in their country views they may take whole tracts of land with towns and villages waters woods hills and sea from ealt to wefl without moving\ either head or eyes tis likewife proper for thofe who are ignorant\ of perspective.\ we mult here allo thew method for reprefenting all sorts of fore-\ portned fat-faced ordennances whether pictures hangings or bals-\ reliess againtt walls cielings or any where elfe either flanding hanging or lying and that with certainty according to perspettive.\ thefe are things which painters often meet with in exhibiting\ rooms galleries gardens and other places and the method for\ doing it tho not attended with difficulty yet fometimes purzles thofe\ who neglect it.\ have therefore cholen the example in plate lxiv which is the\ foundation of all forethortnings as well of apartments as cielings and the performance is as follows having made the scheme of room in perspettive divide the height and widch of the side-\ wall where would have hlangings or reprefentations of pictures\ into certain number of diminithing feet fetching the crofs-lines\ from the point of sight and the perpendiculars from the plan or\ sale.\ now in this example we perceive four principal ferehorinings for is the cieling side-wall the floor loofe picture\ hanging forwards all four proceeding after one and the fame man-\ ner from the point of sight as the middle part thews which is\ divided into squares to fay more would be ufelets and tedious to\ thofe who are in the leaff converfant with this art.\ chrp of the harmeny and unien of colours in cieling-\ piltes.\ ltho in the chapter touching the deities and their qualicies we shall treat of the colours proper to them we mult on this\ no the painting of\ i fay fomething previous and thew how the colours ought\ to be placed and handled in order to create perfect harmony.\ tol my not herein

and hill more with\ laction of proper colours and those thinly and trantparently\ whcreby it gets the propercy of picture.\ as the prrripil goodnets of cieling-piece lies in an artful dipo\ hon of the figares asove each other to tis of no lets contequence nat the colours be well adaptedtherero.\ will now gve an latlance in two pieces differing from each other\ +\ in light and chade the one has three and the other two depits\ the former has its undermot depth ttrongly fer orf in colour agaiil\ the second which is lirtle dark and the third is light againit the\ jark bine of the sly in the latter which think the bett on ac\ count of de-sram the uppermoll croup is dark againll light ble\ sky and the undermoll by the force of light fit off againt\ the uppermofl even were we thus to dispose three or more crounb\ or groups over each other it would look very decorous and each\ deity\ cielings or pialonds.\ would neverthelets keep its proper colours yet lets in foree in proportion to the diffance fer when the uppermoft croup is fe off againt the light sky it caules wonderful gooff and the reaton\ proceeds from the skys feeming to be infinitely higher which con-\ trarywife can not be effected.\ if it be objected that fuppoling one of the principal figures in the\ uppermoft group ought according to its dignity and the reafons\ laid down in the fuiring of colours to have white dress and\ therefore the aforefaid polition will be overthrown deny it for it\ may be helped by difpoting some dark clouds behind which will\ preferve that garment in its force and make it have pleating har-\ mony with the reft of the work in the difpolition of objects over near and behind each other we have more largely handled this point and shewed its truth and decorum for dark againtt light can not advance with to much force as the light may againtt the dark be-\ caute the light has greater strength in itfelf however to put an\ end to point of to great latifude which by dilcourfe can not be\ fully demonffrated shall conclude it with the great tunius who in\ his third book of the art of painting fays thus we see that artifs in their werks create shades or depths to the end that the parts to come eut may appreach with more force and\ seem to meet the exe of the beholder even without the picture let\ two parallel lines ays longinus be drown upon cloth with light\ and dark colours the brightness of the light will joonet strike the\ eye and seem to be nearet and little further quoring johannes\ grammaticus he fays if we paint board with white and black the white will always seem to be nearer and the black further off.\ therefore continues the fame author in his obfervation on this point the painters also make use of blackish or dirkish brown colburs when they\ are to represent the deep hollow of well ciftern ditch bottomless pir or the like but when on the contrary they will make any thing come\ out as the breafts of woman an hand held ont or the fect of leaping or running herse they ley on both the sides jufficient shade of\ black and brown colours in order that these parts may by the neighbour-\ ing darkness be flung of from the picture with lively ferce.\ chap.\ de sublim oriz rg in lib metserd aif id\ of the painting ie.\ ch ap xi of the deities in facred and prosane history and\ paties and firt of the difference between facred and profane re-\ fitzntaritn.\ in done with trearing of cieling-pieces thought it\ improper to end this book and make new one of the following\ chapters becaute the mlatter has fuch connexion that we\ can fcarce think of the one without falling prefently on the other.\ irs certain that in common pictures the deiries gholls demi-\ gods angels virtues and other powers may likewife be introduced nay are even infeparable adjuncts but into cieling-pieces where\ the upper-part is the shy they muft of necefficy come becaute the\ major part of fuch reprefentations relate either to their perfons qua-\ lities of virtues.\ now duely to execute this reprefentation of the deiries the ar-\ tifl ought chiefly to be acquainted with the facred and profane\ sterres as well as with the poetical fictions that he may learn from\ them the partucular occurrences and properties peculiar to each per-\ ion and rank of the deiries or upper-powers and reprefent them\ accordingly for altho imaginution mult in this point lend great af\ lillance yer its not fafe for every man to rely intirely thereon left\ he should be deceived like the man whofe neighbour dreaming that in certain place was hidden great treafure and awaking and\ going thither found it by digging and carried it home he on this\ good luck laid himfelf down on an heapof poppies in hopes of the\ lame happinets but after long sleep he awaked without any ad-\ vantageous intimation from his dream contrarily found his pocket\ pick\'92 and thus at once was bereft of his hopes and the money he\ before had in poffettion this simile is too plain to need nearer ap\ plication\ judicious mafter muft certainly be well exercifed in the know-\ ledge of the true conditions of the things he is to handle that he\ mar not be thought an lgnoranc for the truth can not be hidden\ with respect to the inventor wherefore you ought to take heed of\ mixing this truth with falfe things especially in facred stories of\ piritual reprefentations fince there is to great genrrariety between\ them that they can not be joined unlets to thew the difagreement or plafonds.\ chap ii.\ fay they can not poffibly be joined in order to exprets fingle mean-\ ing but will rather ferve to confound weaken and miltake it except\ they be feparately difpoted the spiritual above in heaven and the\ werldly below on the earth speak with respelt to emblems for\ there is great dilparity between pallas and the wifdem of god fince the latter can not be attributed to any perfon and much less re-\ prefented on earth the fame may be said of janus and provi-\ dence the begventy and civil tuffice are alfo very unlike we\ mult therefore note that the whole lconology or science of the\ heathenith figures tho formerly accounted heavenly has now\ no relation to the soul but to the moral vircues and merits of\ men.\ let us then inquire with reverence what are chriflian emblims and what prefane or heathenish uting in spiritual representations no-\ thing but what is pure and heavenly and in the worldly all thats\ proper to them in order to gain the elleem both of religious and\ worldly pertons.\ paffage in scripture mentions the driving lucifer and his compa-\ nions out of heaven whence we may plainly conclude that thote\ monfters afterwards fell to the share of the heathens as no longer\ pertaining to the saints but we do not find after that time any\ more fuch unruly spirits were expelled heaven wherefore we are not\ allowed to reprefent more fuch inftances but in the cafe of men\ seen to battle the true faich things may be accompanied and repre-\ fented with heathenith emblems becaute as is faid the heathear\ gave themfelves up to the devil the better by that means to ex-\ prets their error and thew the truth thus alfo driving them out of\ heaven.\ it is upon occafion likewife not improper or difagrecing with the\ pharifees or hypocrifes but has greater weight in tillicious stories\ or parables nor can we without offence introduce other emblems\ than chriffian like when they only tend to incite to salvation in\ which cale we may reprefent angels or spirits to keep thofe hypo-\ crites out of heaven\ in true profane hifferies as the reman grecian and others this\ management would be improper but we may lawfullvule bereghphic\ and other characters of which there is an infinity for inftance by\ perfon white garment or an offering cup by

painters to reprefent god the futher as kind loving old man and the angels in an human shape.\ it feems allo that painter has the privilege to paint and repre-\ fent inanimate things as living according to the idews which scripture\ affords him and the spectator mult not be offended when in fome\ pittures he finds facred subjects attended with poetical fictions for\ their better explanation on supposition the latter be impious are\ not the pfalms of david solomon song the bock of job and the\ revelation of st. john the divine all delivered under poetic figures not to speak of the parables befides mentioned in scripture.\ painters therefore are not blame worthy for bringing in some\ thing that is hearhenifh in order to clear the alatter and elpecially if\ the falt happened in an heathenith country thus the great ro-\ phacl in his pasfage of the children of ifracl over lordan has repre-\ fented the river under an human shape violently turning the water\ back towards its source.\ as scripture often lays down fuch and the like things under fome\ fgural descriptions it gives painters full liberty to do the fame fince in order to accommodate ittelf to the weak apprehentions of\ no the painting of\ book ix.\ it ufarlly delivers many of the greateff myfteries under figures\ and parables as it speaks of the rivers in pfalm xevin pouffin alfo made no scruple in

lyes and having no more re\ gard for either than to treat them alike vet if we look nearer\ this matter we shall be convinced that the learned painter was\ ro in the leat cinctured with acheifm did it not happen in hea-\ trenih eeger was not pharach daughter prefent did the believe\ tne trum which was only manifelted to graelf certainly the did not.\ since therefore the falt lay in an heathenith country and was done in\ the prefence of but two hebrex women the others being ethnicks this great artiff has not trespafied either againft the chriflian farth or\ againtt the art.\ and alcho at the firft view well grounded objection may be that with things which relate to religion no falle gods or deiies worthipp\'92 by the heathens ought to be mixed and that it is fuffi-\ cient for painter to reprefent river in its natural courfe and not\ in an himan form fer the objection is eafily anfwered for scrip-\ ture repreients the waters and the noise of rivers under an human\ form as in

judgment\ to be refured by shewing the ufe that judicious artiff made thereof\ for fiction is here not at all mingled with truth but only tends to\ make\ cielings or plafonds.\ truch clear to sight and apprehention and thus more plainly\ to exprets it by the fillizious characters and emblems.\ pray oblerve in his birthof the french king lewis xiil how that\ excellent artiff has exhibited caffer with an arrful sway on diflant\ clouds fitting on his winged horle and oppofice to him apolle who in\ his radiant charior is driving upwards in order to thew that this prince\ was happily berninthe

and by apolle the time of the day which was in\ the morning appearing by his chariors mounting up from the\ horizon.\ but further to clear my thoughts touching the reprefentation of\ god the father shall before end this chapter fubjom the follow-\ ing oblervation.\ mentions that he saw the\ the propher exchiel in his firtt chapter almighty from the appearance of his loins even upeards and from\ the appearance of his loins even downwards as it were the appearance\ of fire and it had brightness round about wherefore by this and\ other inflances of scripture we fuppofe that this sacred figure ought\ never to be represented without glittering or glery from head to foot even in fuch manner that bigger or lets according to the place oc.\ cation and decorum and preading around gradually thinner and\ fainter like clear and tranfparent vapour it at latt infentibly unites\ with the by-works and difappears.\ now to reduce this to painting we ought firft to defign the fi-\ sure of the almighty whether ficting or flanding in heaven or on\ earth in the mofl perfecl form and countenance yet much bisoer\ any heavenly or earthly creature this you muft colour with fingle tint or ground little darker than the glory and afterwards\ heighten with light then with large bruth foften the figure to that neither its out line nor any edginels or charpnets of the parts\ of the face hands or fect which ought to be touched very gentle\ and faint be perceived jutt as if it were viewed thro silk craute reamed glass of thin mift in thort like things feen in camera\ obseurg obferving that the figure do not receive any light either\ from on high or from side or from behind but in frent only and about the moft relieved parts altho the whole piece have an\ other light it mult moreover have no other scades than in the\ deepell cavities and those very faint.\ i the painting of\ have before curforily thewed why we reprefent the almighty\ as venerable old man and shall now further infift on the pont tho without reference to all the paltages in scripture which might\ ferve our purpofe in duniel chap vii tis written of tis head was like pure wool and his gurment white as snow.\ the reason wbereof lays gregorius nezianzenas is to shew\ thereby as by an infullible token his clean and andefited being where-\ fore the wife exicherns is allo of opinion that for the same reason\ the ceir and maltitude of angels are represented in white others\ compare it to the human shape and would thereby allude to infinite\ durarn fince nothing is to eternal as the godhead which re-\ mark here becaute some fcrupulous perfons are of opinion that we\ ought not to reprefent god the father in fuch shaps aforned with\ white garments and grey hair.\ and on this account all nations have by an univerfal confent thought proper to perform divine service in whice garments and or\ naments the whice has alto been at all times appropriated to the\ holy service wherefore the poet perfins lays \'97 he is wersipped\ in waite.\ but what is perfas saying to us fince the raiment of fefts\ chril when he manifelted his glory to his dilciples appeared as\ the white looks\ white as snow cicero lib legum

to make it look more natural that\ you keep it litle yellowith as lighted by sun or like the glory\ which furrounds the figure.\ but in all this painter must be very discrect and not abuse the li-\ cence allowed him by scripture and the consent of the fathers or by\ his art gervert the facred truths or flight them.\ kiii of the glories proper to angels and beathenmisp\ deities.\ vin thew\'92 in what manner and on what terms ac\ cording to my judgment to reprefent the almighty let ws\ now inquire how the angels in their power ought to be exhibited\ or plafonds.\ chap ij.\ nuxianzenns lays that the true property of the angels when\ they appear in badity shape is to have bright glery and glittering\ garments we find the ngels thus defcribed in matt xxviil in\ mark xvi in and many other places of scripture.\ this glittering light of the angels ought therefore by all means\ to be obterved in moll of their appearances as for inflance in thofe\ co araham and in the delivering lot out of sodom where they\ fmore the lutful people with blindness for irs certain they had\ fomething more than human fince abrabam lalures them as lords.\ tis not likely that this honour proceeded from their coflly dress lewels and other precious things about them but from some heaven\ ly or uncommon addition.\ further proof of this glory of the angels is the fore preffing\ of the sedemites upon lor and their not covecing either him of his.\ daughters or any other strangers probably living among them but only thefe two young men to be brought out in order to know\ them and perhaps becaute of their more than human form and\ charming brightnets if now this glory had thone too firong they\ would have perceived fome deiry and forbore their wickednets for it can not be imagined that any man should daringly and know-\ ingly frive againtt the almighty.\ but before we proceed further muft here deliver my opinion touching the perfon of fefus chriff which is that in his humanity\ and before his resurrection he ought to be reprefented without the\ seaft shining or glory fince he was made in the likeness of men and would be like his brechren in all things except sin as scripture\ relifies but after his resurrection he should be shewn with glory as we read he appeared to his dilciples on mount taber and in other\ places as having thea put off his humanity in its principal purpofe.\ now to proceed.\ we have further inffances of the appearance of angels as in those\ who came to manuah gideon and tobit and him who imote the peo-\ ple of terufalem for david sin c of the firft scripture expretty\ lays that be forecelling manoah the birth of samfon ascended in\ the flame of the altar poltibly in an augmentation of cglery unicing\ with the flame of the offering by which doubling brightness the\ parentsof samson were rrengthened in their faith and hope of the\ birth to come.\ if this glory now be painted too frong and like lightning it blinds\ our mortal eyes and thus the patriarch abrabam could have viewed\ the painting of\ book ix.\ no more than the prophet and leader of irael mloses when god\ appeared to him and patied before his face and this glory would\ deffroy beholder.\ the blind heathens had glimmerings of this truth for when\ semcc prefumptuoully defired that tuprter might once embrace her\ in the tame majefty as he did june in heaven and infifted on it not-\ withflanding his diffuation to the contrary the was on the requeft\ granted intirely confumed by the attending glory of the god info-\ mgh that with difficulry he faved the child he had by her.\ whence it plain that the glory even in exhibiting the heathenish\ deities ought to be oblerved fince in their appearance to men ei-\ ther by night or day to bless or punith them they recained their\ full force glory and majelty and this being weighed they mull al.\ to be reprefented glittering beautiful in aspect and shape and in rai-\ ment of an elegant colour as much as portible and the nature and ule\ of the picture will permit as we have before hinted in the bandling\ of colours in cieling-pieces.\ but when the derties appear among men as men then they ought\ to be like them and not eafily diftinguithable otherwife than by their\ mien for inftance in the story of tupiter with califfe apello\ with daptne tupiter with lycaen mercury with argas and the\ like in fuch cales and that they might the better play their parts they transformed themfelves incirely inco men and were perfectly like\ them laying afide all god-like glory and shape as if according to\ the opinion of the heathens they meant that there can be no union\ of the divine with human nature.\ as to the aotions of the heathenith deiries many reprefent them\ appearing in altive poftures as walking running and other motions but its as contrary to my own opinion as that of the great bihop of\ hippe heliedoras this learned man and great searcher into heathen\ ith annquiries will not allow them to go or walk when seen in their ma-\ ie but only to ware or teem in some meature to walk yet gliding\ like ship moved gently along by the wind without perceptible\ motion they ought always to be fet out with rhin

well-shap\'92 joung men between and years of age and\ without beards having long light hair composed countenances and cay\ metions and dog\'92 skin over their upper-parts.\ the reaton of this

before humanity which the genis abhorr\'92 pur\ iuing and barking at us in order to awake the confcience of which\ opinion is cenforimas and feveral others whom he quores adding that thefe spirits

that the ancients confidered their genir\ as gods of precreation either that as we have faid they took care\ of us or were born with us for which reafon they believed there\ were as many genis as men and that each had his own or elfe that\ there were twice as many and that each man had good one and\ an evil one the former perfeading to virtue and the latter to vice agreeable to what chriflians fay

do not find the ancients hal any statues or refemblances of\ them but we read as writers rellify that they appeared to\ many.\ pistarch appianus flerus and others report that as bruths one\ night

their opinion their prayers to the gods\ by means of fire which being suppoted medium between heaven-\ ly and human things they pretended it to be mediator or mefien-\ ger accordingly virgil in his eneid \'97 touch the altar and call the fire upon it and the gods to witness cc they urge fur-\ ther that fire unites with material parts and always rifes upwards\ from below as knowing all our carchly actions and imparting them.\ to the heavenly spirits hence we fee that the manners of offering\ sacrifices are not without fome foundation in reafon becaute the\ laws of nature were always purely oblerved and fince the world\ has been enlightened with the truck fire is cultomarily ufed in divine\ service and no sacrifice was thought acceptable without it indeed if\ of the painting of\ book xi.\ earthly tirestures can in anywife reconcile us to heaven nothing has\ with the spirit than fire as it lights and clears\ greater every thing wherefore they think they may reprefent the genii\ and angels even the deity itfelf by it.\ as to the atars and piety we fee in the medal of the empe-\ for lius figure with open hands which as before obferved igaines werfing and by ir an aktar with thefe letters pietas.\ in one of halrianas augura is the same figure between stork and\ an allar adorned with groundlvy with this inscription pletas\ at in one of dirs augaia fauffina appears

either in making vows or fe\ ceiving favours in confequence of them hence proceed the various\ inscriptions on medals which nevercheless do all allude to piety whether in praying for help or returning

origines intimates that the offering bullock before the taberna-\ cle according to the ancient tewiss rice fignified that ree must jub-\ due all pride and haughtiness and by calf the having overcome

and dexteriry of the hands ic\ contills in the symmetry or exact divifion of the objects according to\ their particular qualities especially in the human figare wherein it\ moll excels and next in quadrupeds all relieved and conformable to\ the life.\ ies other performance concerns the bassrelief or half round\ work according to its different qualities as we shall hereafter ex-\ plain.\ the materials for statuary are of five sorts and each of particu-\ her narure and quality.\ the firk is clay.\ the second wax.\ thethird wood.\ the fourth ivory.\ the fitth stone.\ the two firfl are worked with wooden tools and the reft with\ harp lrons and each material requires particular handling from\ the firft fomething is taken of to the second fomething is added in\ the third is cutting in the fourth scraping and in the latt driving\ or thrulting according to the nature of the matter either foff or\ hard folid dry or briitle.\ in an human figure or other creature statuary firtt sketches

proper tools or\ rather with the fingers the life is fet to the fame pofture in order\ statuary.\ .\ to finith after it and being brought to this forwardacts the artifl pro-\ ceeds gradnally round tillall sides are finithed and nothing is wanting.\ the work flanding in this condition for some time to dry is after-\ wards baked in an oven and then may ferve as model for carving in\ marbleor other matter the efience of this art lies in beautiful ferm and neat or diffintt\ representation of the things we would make whether haman figures bezts or other objects of which the principal are

manner thall begin with\ bass reliefr of which there are three sorts viz almost relief half relief and faint or fat and the difference of thefe ought to\ be well confider\'92 as they have three particular inteations in their\ proportions or divifions.\ the frtt sort or almoff relief is commonly uted in deep nicbes with figures in full proportion having three grounds behind one an\ other the foremolt figures are almost relief the second balf relief and the third somewhat less.\ the fecond sort or balf relief is uted in shallew squarl niches frentifpieces circulan-beaded upper-doers and niches this has two\ grounds or depths the frlt is balf relief and the second jomowbat\ jainter.\ the third sort is proper for frizes pedestals balluffrades and me-\ dals this has but ons deptb or fingle figure on one ground.\ in their ordonnance four things are to be obterved.\ that the principal figare of the work have its full relief and\ thole of the leaft contequence most faim and ricking to the\ ground.\ that the greateff motion and action of the figures be always in\ prople yet without any forethortening of the members.\ that ther setting on of the projelting parts appear natural not\ forced.\ that the work be equally divided and diftributed every where\ alike not too fall in one part and too empty in another which is point of great importance.\ altho\'92 thefe bass-reliets feem chiefly to concern statuaries yet they\ as much affeet painting on account of the particular relation the two\ arts have to each other in that one can not be perfect without the\ other the statuary borrows from the painter the ordonnance or dif\ polition for the ground of his work which he afterwards puts in\ praltice the painter on the other hand learns of the statuary the\ method of modelling as neceffarily ferving for foundation in the\ pexformance of balsrelief wherefore think painter can not pot\ no stasuary.\ fibly paint good one unless he underfland fomething of modelling nor good statuary give sacisfaltion without having some skill in\ painting.\ judicious mafter ought to be exalt in ordering thefe batsreliess that exch receiving its preper light all may appear diffintt and with-\ out the leaft alteration sun-ine or parg sbades make things look\ otherwife than they really are by the mishapen ground hades which\ on thofe occafions are feen in nature when the work being much\ raifed has many deep hollows.\ large and aniverfal light is moll advantageous for the firf sorr or almost relief.\ light fontewbat mere fram the side is most proper for the fecond or balf ketief becaute it has but few kilings and the work is there.\ fore more free from ground hades and\ direct side-light is bett for the third or fainter sort as giving it\ great deceram and eleganct tho it be almoff without shade.\ this deltrine touching the light may poffibly feem ftrange to some viz that it ought to be governed by the bass-reliefs or piltures which\ are to fland or hang in it according as they are more or lets relieved but we muft conceive that proper light ought to be chofen for each\ sort of bassrelief from this confideration that the light is not\ equally good exery where here fairs batsrelief in deep niche there one less rifing and here again one that is quite flat the one\ being thus lighted from side and the other fronting nevertheless it must not be thought that according to the make of the room the\ difpolition of the windows and the places fix\'92 for niche on each\ side of the chimney is in our choice to have in one of thofe\ batsrelief of three grounds and in the other one of two grounds or one becaute that which is neareft to the windows receives more\ froming light than the other wherefore they ought to be alike\ hollow and raifed by proper ligbt we mean that the work\ mult be to order\'92 that each part according to its light get good\ decorum for inflance in the formor niche where the figures are\ much raifed they can not give fuch large ground-fhades fince the\ light falls on them little froncing but may happen in the other where the light comes more from the side unless you placed the fi\ gures which in one niche are on the right side in the offer of the\ tek thereby to prevet the fuperfirous shades and eleganly recon\ cile the difference of the lights.\ th\ of statuary.\ as\ the baterelicts in shallow niches with two grounds vice an obtervation and the fame condubt is necelfary in frizes pe-\ deflals and medals.\ many err in placing batsreliefs in frizes of chimseys on pedeltals\ and over room-doors even upon the breaft-work of the chimney it\ self fetting there more than half relieved nay whole relieved fi-\ gures as once law an almost relief on single groand in chimncy-\ trize in my opinion tis very improper to make figures of nine\ inches leagth to very diftant from each other and to litle draperied cfometimes figure has fcarce three or four folds the work look-\ ins then to peak in painter like terms more like fmooth dead\ colouring or rather old and wore out than new made and should\ by right be execured as faint and fine again have obferved that\ painters in reprefenting bals-reliels in luch places avoid all large\ shades as much as poffible especially in frizes pedeltals and other\ flats it being in my opinion very proper that thofe parts of the\ archtecture keep their flarness and as all the ornaments viz capi-\ tals foliage modillions triglyphs and the like are in fuch cafe\ commonly perform\'92 neat and curious to our figures ought likewife\ to be perfectly finithed.\ some keep too much to the great manner but the fmaller the\ things are especially withindeers and near the neater they muft be forwithout-deers the cafe is different becaute there they receive light\ from all sides and are less fet off be they ever to much railed.\ wherefore statuary joined to architecture in fuch manner as it\ ought to be is the bufinets of judicious artifl and for which so\ one is qualified without great praltice.\ as this study concerns painter as well as statuary shall shew\ the former in how many different manners balsrelief may be paint-\ ed and feeing the moft expedicious is always the beft shall lay\ down that which by experience have found to be beft.\ firft paint my cloth neat and even with fuch colour as my\ balsrelief requires whether white grey red yellow between\ light and shade or in second tint drawing my ordonnance on\ this ground correctly and rrongly trace it over with black lead\ and after rub it with dry cloth that it may rick fall and reliff the\ varnith without muddling then varnith it all over and proceed\ to painting firtt the shade and then the second tint againtt it leav-\ ing the ground for the light and uniting the shade wich the second\ of statuary.\ airily without fofiaing them with fitch fcumble the\ second tint either with finger or fliff peacil into the grount\ then itake another tinr as dark as my model direlts and with it\ give ground behind my figures leaving the work on the light\ side without the leaft rehef being to finith rub the whole work of as mich as can do at once with lighter iint than the firft ground and to very thin and even that every thing may appear through it obferving here that the whice muft be very fiff and thinned only\ with turpentine on this wer ground clapmy main lights which\ then as well as the shades will gradually unite with it without\ touching each other.\ the second and chird sorts may be eafily finithed up at ence the re-\ ronching excepted as having neither ground-fhades nor hollows the\ method is this my cloth being prepared as aforefaid firft height.\ en fcumbling the main light into the wet ground which by therun.\ ning of the oil is become fomewhat tacky do the

and\ tome vellow in the reflexions of the shades if the back-ground\ ought to be little darker now is the time for doing it becaule then\ it will no more go in.\ the laff fortneeds no other groundchan the firft and it ought to\ be neat and even becaute the light on one side and the shade on the\ other make the work relieve and rife fufficienly vec ler us ob\ ferre that as often as we paint or re-touch it muft be rubbed over with\ varnith or at leall where neceffary to prevent its going in for fuch\ is the nature of varnith that it will bear but one painting otherwill\ the work finks prefencly.\ we shall now thew what is to be obferved in painting figures in deeg\ nicbes work not to be performed either with respelt to the figures\ or groundshades without due knowledge in peripective whatever\ applaate ignorants may get from thate who do not underfland\ ii.\ his blunder was great who painting fine figure in niche with\ stick in ir hand thewed the ground shade of the stick very plain\ ly on the hollow of the niche but gave none to the leg which fop\ porte\ of statuary.\ the body fave little on the plinth next the foot.. moft fad\ condult another fimple young fellow feeing his malter paint orey figure in niche and being cold that the ground-hade was watter of much importahce and ought allo to be correll and being\ at the fame time thewn the model it was painted by went immedi-\ ately and got niche made but for want of figure he borrowed\ his mafters and fet ir in the niche tracing therein the ground hade\ with black lead agreeable to which he gave all his figures in what\ altion foever the same ground-shade.\ now it certain that things painted on firm places ought that\ they may look natural to have their proper groundshades according to\ the relief well obferving whence they receive their light front-\ ing or fidewife how farthey are from the light in order to de-\ termine their shades as one fomewhat thort charp and frong as be\ ing near

this story is faintly reprefented but in my opinion the mafter has omitted the buftle and violent stir of\ meleager'\'92 body in order to preferve the elegance of the action find it allo not flrange that few can underfland this story without\ tome writing under it we there fee the parce of three fatal sifters but nothing of the mother and tho we luppose diass to be prefent\ yet that circumffance does not fully clear the\ and mourning meaning meleager should rather have had his hunting equipage\ ard dogs by him in order to point our his perfon and inclina-\ rons nd tho the burning of the wood feem in some meafure to\ express the matter yet think it too nearly cut and fmooth and\ should be more like firebrand but my greatelt wonder is at the\ abfence of the mother althes the who was principal perfon .\ great princess and alted this tragedy orr of revenge and feeing tis\ one of the greateft effects of revengeful temper to triumph in the\ prefence of thofe who are overcome moreover we fee no aclive paffi-\ ons rule in any part of the compofition nor can fay who the\ woman litting by him is whether his mother diana halania or\ wha\ book .\ of statuary.\ elfe can not believe the is his mother becalift he feems to be as\ oll as the moreover we do not perceive in him any motion of perton in paih nor can apprehend the defign of the face on the\ round board below on the ground it not being medal for orna-\ ment tho doubtless placed there by the artift for some reafon some\ think it reprefents rage or trouble or elfe fite becaufe the hair\ teems to be flaming but the matter might have beef berter expret\ by prefting of the eyes fruggling of arms and legs contraction\ of the nofe mouth fingers and toes and the trouble and pain of\ the dying perfon whereas here we fee nothing like it but contrari.\ ly he feems to dic very quictly as his arms lying clofe to his be.\ dy at full length fufficiently thew befides tis againft the rule of\ emblems to admit of any aid where the fall can be performed by\ the perfon himself much less the addition of two or three figures to\ exprets the meaning unless they be statues fuch as tyranny with\ nere ambition with alexander valour with scipie and to forth.\ irs true that painters ufed formerly before they were acquainted\ with expreiting the pattions in the face and geftures to write them\ on scrolls proceeding from the figures mouths that they might\ thereby be underfiood but as artifts are now more enlightened it\ would certainly be very improper to fet cock or spar by mansit-\ ting or standing in order to thew his iuduftry or scall by another to fignify that he is dead .\ by thefe obfervations is apparent that our meleager should rather\ have been known by fine action and motion fince the chief end\ of reprefentation is to express naturally and with energy the ni-\ ture of the matter and this may as well be done in biss-relief as\ painting if the story require it nevertheless we muft obferve that\ there are some paftions which do not work externalty and ought to be\ exprefted by addrions in order to make them intelligible fuch may\ be charny mercy fiety liberality and the like but anger madness or rage pain smarl which diffurb the body as well\ as the mind by irritating the members do not require emblematic\ figures of additional explanations.\ chap\ statuary.\ ny anicen na in ee in of the

the greateff\ application and pleafure in order to give it sofiness and it that\ fucceed well they are perfectly charm\'92 with it infomuch that we\ may often perceive in what part their greateft

perfection lies in conjunction of both wherefore it is certain that\ if phidias and praireles had been mafters of berninis handling and\ elegance and this laft the knowledge of the greefs all three would\ have deferved the greater prailc.\ ias readily own as take it for granted that art owes its defelts\ to arcifis themfelves as well in painting and staruary as archirec=\ tere proceeding not

found themfelves obliged that they might not go\ againft hiffory to dress their figures in the mode of the times.\ we shall now confider the neceffary obtervations in printing statues\ and batsreliefs it is certain that they muft be very neat and white becaufe fuch works in stone being both hazardous troublefome and\ cofflr were never undertaken before the artifts had cholen fine blocks\ of marble for that purpofe wherefore we ought to take notice of\ the stones and their kinds.\ light marble is various one sort intirely ssbite another shipp thid fet-olour cc being thus either in nature or chang\'92 thro'\ time they are all good when free from spots of eyes and appear\ well agrinft proper grounds.\ for this reafon we fee that the ancients reprefented the beff and\ moff remarkable hiffories either in copper or white marble as many\ remains on palaces temples henorary arches columns pyra-\ mids tombs coc can witness single whire has alo this advan\ tage above the colour\'92 paintings that it does not foon change and\ when it fades as marble itfelf is not free from it it is all of co.\ lour the ufe of it is certainly attended with much less trouble and not lets natural than in colours moreover we may fooner find\ ten mafters for this sort of painting than three for colours becaute\ it is but fingle part of the rt and remains always the fame and without alterarion whereas the cafe of colours is quite dif\ terent.\ the grey paintings reprefent only wall or piece of stone -work but the colour\'92 ones thew the life irfelf feen as thro window wherefore the grey can neither recreate nor ferve for particular pictures\ of delight nor can be of further ufe than in the places where they\ are fet for ornament of which they make but small part and\ were any thing

yellow oker but between reddith or por-\ phiry stone with little vermillion or indian red fomewhar upon\ the fleth-colour and this in shade as well as in the fecond tint if\ you learn this colour from

whether.\ thofe which fince their times have been in ufe are reckon\'92 as good and latile whether it be not more advifable to follow the anrique\ and good ones than to feek after new and lets good.\ amidll the infinity of motions incident to nature in general it is\ obferred that every man has one particular to himfelf and peculiar\ to his temper one bultling another flow and third between both and this diltinction can not but be obvious even to man of fmall\ underflanding fince from thence and propenlity for company like\ ourfelves proceed either our love or avertion for this or that per-\ fon and their actions and if this be granted we may be affured that the ancient mafters efpecially the greeks who were to famous\ for wifdom nicely obferved all thofe motions as well the internal\ as external and expreffed them in their feveral works wherefore\ it may then perhaps be inferr\'92 that nothing in this particular remains\ for the improvements of afterages but let me ask why we should\ not as well make ple of our bilicies and judgments in order to go\ forward think we may in other things especially but pafting by\ what\ of staluary.\ book .\ is already done we shall proceed to inquire what statue means\ and fignifies.\ statke reprefents an idol in human shape an idol fay with\ iespect to irs origin and ufe and as far as statuary is concerned form\ il after the beit proportion either in gold silver or other mecal and dexteroutly work\'92 by the hand and judgment of the arcill the\ efes of thefe are to be let in temples courts palaces and other pub-\ lick places but especially to adorn archirecture we find them in scipture as fables for inftance in afordecar when royally\ arrived he was led on horfehack by haman thro the city allo\ in cor when expated by pilare to publick view.\ we likewile and matter for starues in profane even recent stories as for lnmance in the late king witham and qucen hlary of bleffed\ memory moulded from the lite and fee up in the temple of henour and tuch like none of thefe pieces thew either active paffionate or\ violent motiors but plain or grave and majettic fuitable to the dig-\ nies of the perfonases they reprefent and which we ought to conti-\ der as genrlemen or ladies who flanding at doors or windows to\ fee and be feen by the people are ferious and without motion.\ whence the proverb feems to arife \'97 he slands like stone-figine or like dumb and lifelets perfon.\ cr ele .\ we shall therefore confider two sores of starues the anactive and the\ nring the unafive are fuch as fland fingly in riches and on frommif\ ores and the moring or bulling are thofe which are feen in groups\ of =or on fedzenls triwnftal arcpes and fountains.\ now its certain that thefe two sorts of statues mult needs hare\ particular purpoles and therefore particular places for the former\ are teen from single stand for which they are properly made and\ the latter are to be viewed round about from all sides but of this we\ shall tay more in the next chapter.\ as to this larter sort of starues they receive not their appellati-\ ons from the perions they reprefent but from the aftions they per-\ formed or to ahsartunes they unferwent and herein lies the\ main point tince without them the persons fingly of themfelves\ would not be known as in the steries of seneca petus laocoon py\ rimas and others and thefe occurrences or accidents mult be but once art en one occation attribured to them suppole any of thefe perfons\ were to be reprefented by fingle statue as lyocoon with serpent bruwas with sword what difference would there be between\ ore\ of statuary.\ chap who once committed fuch an alt or bore fuch calamity and\ one who in his life-time had gone thro thouland accidents as her-\ cules tbefeus achilles hecter and many others who are reprefent\ ed by one statue wherefore we may eafily conceive that the anci-\ ents have in every respect to firmly fixed and orderly dipoted their\ poltures that there is no room left either for alteration or addition.\ befides we fee that no addicions of the modern maffers are like the\ antique either in qualicy or goodness as is evident in the works of\ quellin keyzer bernini and many others who made no dillinction\ between statues and starues.\ if seem here to contradict myself becaufe having in the preceding\ chapter fet thole three great mafters almoll above antiquity now\ place them below it let it be obferved that am speaking of statues not of bass reliefs for herein they have neither excell\'92 nor been equal\ to antiquity in the beauty air and variety of draperies.\ the ancrents in their statues had in view three principal conditi-\ ons and natures of men the gay the beavy and the moderate the\ are altive full of fire and flender like the apotto the second are\ melancholy flow and liftlets like the antinous and the third sort is\ compoted of temper between both as the mfercurius radians which\ receives its light from below all thefe were ercht by perrier we\ alfo commonly obterve that the active and airy are feldom long with-\ out motion now flanding on one leg then on the other accord-\ ingly the ancients reprefented fuch perfon flanding on one leg.\ relling little or nothing on the other foot but being to exhibit an in-\ dolent voluptuous melancholy one like antinous we may plainly\ dilcover how heavily he flands on one leg and yet reils on the other\ foot his belly sticking out head hanging down and hips exceffively\ riting the contrarieties of thefe two figures are worthy of remark one leems to fly and the other to be finking into the earth as to\ the exprestion of the third figure which is mean between the two\ sorts aforelaid he as well-temperd perfon is made flanding firm\ on his legs looking thoughtfully down without any turn not too\ hery or eaty nor too much funk one hip fwelling little more thin\ that of apollo and fomewhat lets than that of antinous and tho reft-\ ing on one leg yet appearing more firm than the one and more airy\ than the other.\ now as the ancients knew how to divide thofe three different bo-\ dies to very nicely according to their nacures and action to we need\ not question but they handled all treir other figures in the lame maa-\ hicr.\ book .\ of statuary.\ fpeak in reference to their qualities as kill-flanding baccbus mers hereales satarn even the women goddeffes and nymphs\ not excepted all which proceed either in greater or lets degree from the three standards before mentioned this truth is evident not\ only from thefe examples but likewife from what we daily meet\ with whether in models or prints ler us then not imagine that we\ are able to inveat new actions for our statues or others than thote\ which are already found much less that they should be better and\ more proper but rather employ our thoughts more advantageoutly\ on other things and in the mean time implicitly follow the ancients\ in study to noble and in which they took to much pains.\ the main point lies in the beautiful sway of statue well\ expred according to the quality condition nature and intention of\ it but hereby mean not that we are obliged punctually to imitate\ the actions and poftures of the ancients without the leaff deviation contrarily every man has the liberty of exercifing his ingenuity their works only as patterns which have always followed and would have others do the fame without fear of being therefore\ call\'92 copyilts or their works copies such moderation think\ even very commendable fince the fable of learas teaches us that\ high fyers have often great falls or by avoiding scylls they get\ into chargbdis.\ there hill remains neceffary remark touching the explanatory\ addituments of statues and to be brief shall thew their natures in\ three particular starues and chufe out of many the stories and fi\ gures of lxcretis dido and thisbe among the women thole of\ the men may on the fame foor be eafily apprehended.\ reprefent thefe three women with daggers in their hands to de-\ note that they fell by thofe weapons.\ lxcrefis is grave and majeftic.\ dids haughty and proud and\ thisbe very plain and

rands the figure of pyramus and on the other two turles un-\ demeath thefe two latter appears the fact itself as in the firft.\ thefe think fufficient examples for further reprefentations as\ having thew\'92 the difference in three which are almoll conformable to each other.\ chap vil of the placing of figures upon pedeffals fromifficces in niches and other places.\ is evident that statuary has dependance on architelture and\ is regulated by it and as firures adorn and give life to land-\ ship to statuary embellifhes and makes archirecture look grand aa\ good landskip-painter knows what objelts are moft proper for an ordon-\ nance and what forms they mult have whether crooked ftrait sland\ ing fitting to the left or right in order to produce decorum as we\ have hewed in the chapter touching irregular objects and skilful.\ architelt ought to be as well acquainted with the mechod of fetting\ off his work with figures balsreliefs and other ornaments according\ to rule that it may thereby become not only magnificent and elegant.\ but we may plainly perceive it muft be so and not otherwife he should\ allo know why tome figures ought to face and others look from each\ other why thefe mult fwell or rife outwardly thole be upright or sit-\ ting .\ upon this account the statuary ought rightly to underfland the\ architelt intention tere he proceed to work as alto what figures he\ is to make naked or cloathed be they of men women or children on what side they ought to rife or fwell and how bent and from\ what side feen and whether they mult fland high or low and to forth being apprized of thefe particulars he is then to execuce his thoughts\ finding according to thofe sways fine actions graceful motions\ no statuary.\ .\ and eiegant draperies from whence may arife general decorum.\ thus much as to theie two ative siffers.\ in relation to the third to wit painting which embraces them\ foth as needing their aid mull fay that as it makes the elegan-\ cies of archredure and staruary whether in hiffory or landskip its chief study to judicious painterought for adorning his archi\ redure with figures batsreliefs gc to be thoroughly acquainted\ with them that he may naturally exprets them with shade and colour even to much as thereby to corred the inevitable mif thapes fill to be\ observed in nature.\ tis unaccountable that among to many good architelts starua.\ ries and painters fo few have underfood the richt placing of statues they tometimes hir it but not upon certain principles wherefore\ we shall enleavour to clear the pomt in few words and three skeich.\ es hoping tiat no offence will be taken at my adapting the matter\ allo to painring fince is has fo near concern therein.\ as there is nothing in nature without imperfection fo in the ufe\ of things we ought to proceed with judgment in order to chule the\ beff for the satustaction of our own eyes as well as thofe of the\ knowirg and lovers.\ in the placing of starues in architecture the same regard muft be\ had wherever they fand or fr speak not of painting alone but\ what generally concerns both the arrs statuary in the firft place and afterwards painting see plates xv and lxvi.\ behold the skerch in plate lxv with accention and my orderly\ difpoficion of the starues in different places fufficiently to evidence\ the regularity of my scheme to any one who has mind to try the\ contyary.\ here you are only to obferve the our lines of couples or pairs of\ figures and their posfures againf each orher for fingle figure ads\ for irfelf but pair or couple of figures thews the refult of both.\ have formerly afferred what conflitutes beautiful action sawely geod tarn of the members and motion of the head armm hands and feet.\ the example chiefly concerns statuaries who hy obferving thaif\ pofition will thew that they underfland it and are able to order and\ make large things as well as fmall.\ the example respects painters tha it be the same as the ford\ mer in reference to the our line but with respeet to sbade wheat\ of statuary.\ chap are confined to fingle and fixed light we ought to chule proper\ and advantageous one that the out-ne as our principal purpofe may thereby maintain its force and produce the effeet and decorum we\ defire as you fee here with its oppofite.\ we have formerly faid that the out-line without the shale is of no\ effeft and that beautiful action and out-line may lofe their ferce and\ the gracefulness be spoilt by an improper light which mis- pape is very\ vifible in sharp and broad lights and mere difagreeable than in stirring\ figures.\ the gd example concerns thofe who paint figures balsreliefs and other ornaments either in whice red yellow or ofher colour\'92\ marble or stone here obferve not only the outline as in the\ firft example or the fame paded as in the second but likewife the\ colour of the stone as well in the shade as light tay especially in\ the sbade becaute therein appears the greateff variety either by means\ of the air or fome other reffexions.\ another of our politions has been that all objects retain their naty-\ ral beauty in the shade unless they receive reffexions from other things bkewife that white is the most susceptible of it and by its cleanness easly\ receives whatever colour it meets with confider allo the great diffc-\ rence between the clofenels and solidity of marble and the thinnels\ and tranfparency of linnen in the third example you will find that\ white marble not without reafon produces yellow or ruffet shades wherefore you ought carefully to confult nature in order to imitate her\ with knowledge.\ but to return to the firft example let us abferve how two opposing\ figures appear in their out line firft upon the frontispiece where\ thele two figures swell outwardly the faces either regarding or turning\ from each other and the arms the same and the middlemoll prast without swell and frenting and thote on the outtides allo with licle of ne turn as being feen only forward secondly the two figures on\ each side of the steps likewile swell outwardly yet mere turning than the\ others becaute being allo feen lidewife they ought to be beautifut from\ three sides thirdly the foremoft figure may have as much turn and\ attion as you please and be good quite round fourchly tne figures\ in the niches are frenting without the leaft turn or stir and the great-\ off swell is forwards lus allo very proper for the rien to sand below and the women above becaute the woman tapers upwards and there-\ fore is more dilappearing and usiting with the fir which in archi=\ fecture\ statuary.\ .\ relture has fine effelt for this reafon they formerly offentimes fet\ mall pyramids on the tops of houfes inflead of figures.\ the uppermsl figures againtt the sky look beft naked becaute of\ their airimess thole in niches mult be maffy and dref and those be-\ low on the ballytrade half dred thus much as to the firft skerch.\ the example thews the method to be uted when it happens that the stall canfes visble deformity on the swelling part of ei.\ gure as to help it by the disposition of an arm bit of drapery or\ hand mean in painting where the light remains atways the\ ant and to which statuaries are not tied especially in the open air becaute the light continually afters but in painting not for as\ things are painted they fland this remark is worth noting as well\ in kirring as htill figures.\ in the sd skeich exhibit flanding figure in niche and be.\ tween them batsviol fuppoled to be of yellowith or rufset wood which colour becaute the figure is of white marble gives prong re.\ fexions on the side we fee another figure between the greens and third lying on the ground furrounded with the ir in all three\ have one and the fame incention viz to thew the couse of the mix\ fare of the skiles otherwife the figures will fometimes teem to be\ made of two serts of stuff as the light parts white and the shades\ of some other colour due obfervation of this enables us to antwer\ for what we do.\ altho\'92 now by thefe politions about the flirring ctions feem to\ contradict former ones namely that in painting of carving statues we\ ought to give them but lirtle turn yet in fact do not spake there\ only touching fingle figare whereas here are many in company and\ thofe fet upon pedeftals fountains and the like places where they\ are feen from all sides which creates difference as well in their na.\ fures as circumllances.\ if am raxed with prefumption for taking upon me to place fr\ gures and fee naked ones and women above and men with thofe which\ are dreft below anfwer that my conduct is founded on architec\ ture which intimates that the five orders are peculiar to five diffe\ rent conditions of men as polyphemus or the giants for the firft or\ der mars as robult or mufculous for the second apolle for his\ stendernels for the third diana or vents as womanith for the\ fourth and iris or cpid for the fifth this confideracion will as well embolden as juffify me.\ staruary.\ chap .\ conclude this chapter shall touch on heads hands and feer have found oth here and in other parts painters as well as\ statuaries very imperfelt in them as if of lets confideration than\ bodies.\ some statuaries do not fufficently vary their faces making little\ difference between vouth and ge giving alfo much into the modern\ way of afettation and exaggerating the parts without any regard to\ tbe antiques by affettation and exaggerating mean kind of\ fondnels in artifts for particular manner as to make the eye-lids\ of their figures too large which caufes an heavy look and to cut the\ dimples on each side of the mouth and the hollows of the nofe and neck too deep feemingly thewing the fatness of women whereas they

and epimedes meeting together from mount lda in cun\ dis and being five brethren they were fliled the idaan dactyl.\ thefe cames being celebrated every five vears with great solemnty the ancients therefore reckon\'92 their time by otympiads thereby\ underftanding period of five vears they confitted of five forts of\ exercifes viz running wrefiling boxing throwing the coit and\ leapins\ of stilllife.\ the place of exercife was fenced in with pales and po.\ speltacor was fuffer\'92 to come within it.\ some pretend thefe games were infliruced by tapiter after he had\ deflroyed the giants who attempted to fform heaven and that apello\ oot the preference in our running mercury that mars bore away the\ prize in wrelling boxing coc others prove that each of the\ aforefaid brethren invented his game and exercife and that being five\ in number they were from the five fingers named dactyls duity.\ in greek fignifying finger.\ the greeks called thefe five exercifes pentatblen and the latins quinquertium two of them had dependance on the legs viz.\ running and leaping two on the arms as the coils and boxing and\ the wreltling respected both arms and legs the victor in all the\ five exercifes was by the greeks called pancratiaffes word com-\ pounded of pan and krates fignifying bellowing the whole force\ of the body in boxing all advantages might be taken for overcom=\ ing the antagonift and the prize was adjudged to him who gained his\ point moft dextrouly accordingly they truck with fifts and el.\ bows kick\'92 bit ferarch\'92 and prain\'92 the kingers hands and other.\ parts of the body they even endeavour\'92 to thrull out each others\ eyes with their thumbs.. in chort no artifice was omitted for gain .\ ing the victory.\ we shall briefly relate in what manner the aforelaid five exercifes\ ere performed.\ the circus wherein they ran on foot was originally stadium .\ or geometrical feet in length but in the olympiad they\ doubled it this race was at firff on foot and in light dref\ but afterwards on horle-back and in armour men called runners.\ this exercife\ on foot were alfo admitted armed from top to toe being judged very proper for the bodies of warriors the firft vic-\ for herein was demaratus of hereg and the hymas fing in their\ honour fufficiently teflify their running in armour but the firtt ,\ who got the prize in running without armour was chorabus of elis.\ after long contell with him about it.. arrachion of phigalia ob-\ tained the prize in the second and third exercifes and potyerates of\ moffene man of noble extraction got much honour and glory in\ fourth wherein he was viltor.\ the wreting was undertaken after the body had been thoroughly\ anointed with ayl in order to prevent cripe and then daubed with.\ fine duft to dry the sweat.. thus prepared the wreftlers entered.\ the lifts and began with feizing the hands then the rms and body\ under.\ of still rfd.\ xi\ under the thort ribs cor thus endeavouring by various mechods of\ strength and dexterity in kicking puthing and other tricks to\ hing one another on their backs for fall on the belly weat for\ nothing before they encerd the king they cauted their parts to be\ foundly rubb\'92 to make them more fupple and agile.\ boxing and fighting with slings were the moft dangerous exercifes\ the former was ancrently performed with ox-leather thongs tied\ about the hands by which with wonderful activity they dealt each\ other very hard blows but the slings confifted of small lea.\ therttraps armed ar the ends with little leaden balls the blow\ whereof when it happen\'92 on the head lay\'92 the adverlary\ dead.\ the coit was flat round heavy piece of stone or lead to try\ the force of arms and hands and to fee who could fling higheft and\ furtheit an exercife htill in ufe in many places to this day but\ with this difference that the ancients with leg lifted up threw\ the coir ar mark fet up on small pyramid and refembling pine-apple.\ the titth exercife was lets perilous as confifting only of divers\ miahnners of leaping.\ the ancient garlands or crowns given as prize to the viltoron\ theic occaions were made of olive-leaves but they varied according\ to the times for they were afterwards compoted of couch -grats willow laurel myrle oak palm and wild parlley-leaves as\ piatarch in the lifs of cuts uricents relates but when made of\ olive-leaves they chole felect kind called calliffepbanes be.\ fifst crown having hanging branches like the myrcle very proper\ for twiling garlands the leaves of fuch garland differed much\ from others in that being white withour the green when twilled was inward whereas the others were white within and appeared greed\ withour herexies and his brethren firft brought this plant into\ greece from the northern countries as punfunias in his olsmpus tells\ us.\ the pyttian gumes were inftituted long before the uphmian yet aftee\ the obmbic and celebrated in honour of apollo for his victory orer\ the frightful serpent pyrton some think they were to called from pyrbss the place of celebration or elfe from the greek word\ pyrbelar to confult becaute they confulted there the oracle in order\ to know the events of things to come the exercifes in thefe games\ only differed from the ohmpic in this that the pythian were per\ formel\ still life.\ chap under the sound of all sorts of vocal and inftrumental malx.\ thote games from time to time had feveral alteraciens in form.\ and solemnity after the inlicution of the pancretium or quinquertium and it is related that in the firtt pyrhiades wherein the moft illuf\ vious hferoes and gods of the ancients enter\'92 the lifts for the sake\ of the prize gaffer prevail\'92 in the horferace pollux in boxing calais in running on foot zetbes in running in complete armour peleas in throwing the coit telamen in wreftling and hercules\ in the pancratium or all the games.\ in each of thefe games and exercifes the victors were crowned\ with laurel which in particular was confecrared to them becaute the\ ancients believed by what they have feigned of penens daughter with whom spotfo was to much enamour\'92 and who was metamor-\ phiz\'92 into that tree that the god took fingular delight in it.\ but others will have the inflitution of the pythian games to be long\ before apollo amour with the beautiful daphne and before the\ laurel bore that dillinction both the triumphal and victors crowns\ and garlands were made of paim or oak-leaves as orid in his firft\ book of mctamerphesss teftifies plutarch and punsanmas relate that\ thefeus on his return from creta adorned the victors in the games\ inflituted in honour of apollo with garlands of palm as tokens of\ praife and renown for the laurel was not known ill after the pyrhian\ games were fertled and when known it gave the rife to the aforefaid.\ fable of dupbne and both the tree and leaves being found of to ex\ traordinary make and nature illurious victors and men of learning\ were commonly crowned with it some again fay that apolle affected\ the leaves and bloffoms of the apple-tree before he chofe the law-\ rel and therefore the viltors in running wreilling cc ought to be\ crowned with that as the poet archias in his aythelog lib cap.\ relates but lucimas afferts that tho in the pythiun games the\ garlands of laurel began to prevail yet they were intermixt with\ fine yellow apples some writers even affirm that the laurel of\ delphos bore fuch large berries or fruit as almoff to gain the name\ of apples but the true reafon of this difference proceeded from the\ fererar alteracions made both in the prizes and times of holding\ thofe games for originally they were celebrated every mingb vear\ from the number of nymphsfeigned by the ancients to come from.\ mount parnasfus to offer to apelle on his having overcome the del.\ phic montter python and afterwards every psth.\ the\ '' pyshicdes fignifies certain number of vears in the pyllian

shall therefore accordng to our imall ability and\ for the service of curious artifts only touch briefly on fome of the\ principal matters relaring to their arms believing the relidue\ will follow in the courfe of their praltice shall begin with the\ giecks.\ the greek foot were divided into two forts pikemen or heary.\ armd and arcbers or light arm\'92 the pikeman uted buckler fort of boots pike or feet in length and sword the\ stowreff had for defence afacedonian round shield of four feet\ diameter the archer bore bucklers of wicker bows thort pikes\ and slings they wore long hair and beards and helmets or head\ pieces fomewhat projecting over the face handfomely wrought with\ imagery or foliage fet off with plumes and other elegant ornaments\ their military dreffes always excelld in variety and elegance\ their coats of armour reached down to the knees cut out on the\ shoulder\ stiltlife.\ chap and below into straps which were often adorned with lions-\ heads some intlead of strags had wifted fringes the generals and no-\ bility wore buskins of young lions or tygersskins or elfe neat sandals but the inferior sort had plain sandals with strings their swords\ hung by their left side by fmall hook on the girdle and on their\ right side was dagger.\ in the roman military order the young men between and of age were appointed for velites or fuift footmen or light-\ arm\'92 the haftati for darters or pikemen tuch as were in their\ prime for principes and the aged for triaris.\ the velites wore lmall buckler of foot and half long an\ head piece sword and lance three feet long and thumb\ thick arm\'92 with sharp triangular pointed steel or head of foot\ in length some carried slings others bows.\ the haffati and principes wore chort coat of armour that they\ might be the firter for march and the management of all sorts of\ arms they had long breeches reaching half-way the legs and clofe at\ the knees an helmer and large oval buckler two feet and an half in\ the tranfverfe and four or five feet in the conjugate diameter they\ were girt with swordson both sides that on the left much longer than\ the other which like dagger was but span long their other\ weapons were two darts or wooden staves one thin like an arrow and three cubits long and headed with iron and the other of the\ tame length and as thick as the breadth of the hand with fonted\ iron head as long as the staff and let halfway into the wood and\ belet with hooks this lron next the wood was finger and half in thicknets.\ the triaris bore the fame arms as the principes except that in-\ read of the darts they ufed pikes formerly carried by the hafati\ and from whence they took their name who left them for the darts.\ the richeff armed themfelves with commodious body-coats inflead of\ brealt-pieces the romans generally wore thort hair with thaved\ chins but the hair growing on each side of their checks vet we\ mull obferve that scipie was the only perfon amons them who had\ long hair the reman helmets cloting with the forchead were\ made either of double leather lron or brass and crefted on top like\ the greeks but less fumptuous except thofe of the generals and other\ commanders which were plum\'92 some alfo had wing helmets and on the crefl smake of dragon or an eagte head we find\ likewife that the ancient romans in their marches carried saw .\ no basker of stillise.\ xi\ basker spade an ax bridle sickle and provifion for three\ days the herculanm of the old troopen and the toviniani or according to vegetins toviunm were two felelt roman legions con-\

bartles.\ the roman horfe wore an helmet and brealt-piece like the foot had crots fhield by the horfes side long sword on their right\ side javelin in their hands and in their quivers three or more ar-\ rows broadiron\'92 yet tharp-pointed and not inferior to the javelins.\ the ensigns both of foot and horfe wore lyons skins over their\ military dreffes and the trumpets the fame fave that the two fore-\ paws of the skins were by thefe latter tied under their chins ferring\ them allo for cloaks thefe skins were not meerly flead with the\ hair on but alto firred for service and underneath

peopie and horfemen wore crefted hel\ fcs forsed on top ther carried bows duggers and battle-axes.\ the sorbian women called amrsins offcnrimes appear\'92 in vineneias fays in antique silver helmers and brealt-piece becaufe their country abounded with that nictal but according to\ ancient memoirs their military dreffes were only adorn\'92 with ser\ pents skins wrought in silver they had the left

reached not quite to their knees their\ defence was target or large round shield cut hollow at one of the\ extremities into the form of two conjoin\'92 crefcents having part\ in the middle for covering and guarding the arm and hand one of\ thefe cuts ferved for managing the lance and the other to look thro.\ they likewife carried axes and hammers.\ the goths together with the great attily defcended from the scy-\ thians were arm\'92 with bows arrows long and firong spears or\ lances shields and helmets the horfemen fullarmourd and car\ rying rrong lances hammers and clubs would leap on their horles\ without the help of the stirrupor other advantage especially on lmooth\ lee or in fnowy ground where they generally fought their greatell bar-\ tles sometimes as need requir\'92 and in the heat of bactle they would in full gallop throw themfelves on another horfe turning and winding with incredible swifiness even carching up lance from the ground co. an evidence what great warriors thefe people formerly were.\ the persians and spartans were very much alike in drels except\ in their head ornaments the former wore turbants and the latter caps like night cap yet pointed on top and curling forwards or\ clle lron head-pieces like the remans but plain and without cred.\ they had long hair and their beards almofl hid their ears on the\ other hand the persions shav\'92 both head and

with their profer grounds.\ chap\ of flewers iii that flower-painter should underfland perspeltive also the mistake of reprefenting things improperly.\ have already afferted that good flower-painter mull needs\ underfland perspective and yet which is to be lamented few\ know any thing of it poffibly fuppoting they have no occation for it and that therefore this branch is to much eafier than hiffors or any\ thing elfe which can not fubliff without perspective as indiffutably re-\ quiring more by-works viz architelture landship or other ob-\ jelt cauting ground shades which never happen in their work and\ should they at any time be non-plusd they canger help from thofe who\ are acquainted with perspective if therefore they have but point of\ sight they think that fufficient and yet not for the sake of the flowers but folely for the corner of marble table or slab whereon they fet\ flowerglats as if the lighting or thading of the flowers were mar-\ ter of indifference this from side that fronting one from below another from above whence their pieces have ufually many points\ of sight sometimes as many as there are flowers but it can not be\ otherwife fince they often paint after models placinga flower on\ the left side which ffood before on the right and the contrary or elfe\ below or above which they imagine nobody will difcover becaute\ they can not fee it themfelves.\ another ridiculous cultom of fome flower-painters in my opinion is that in painting anr gloffi rodies fuch as flower-glalies gold fil\ ver or copper vales afrer the life they fail not to thew therein the\ panes of the winmbes and afcerwards to hang the pictures in halls\ and galleries which have nene here let me take notice of an ex-\ traordinary nice and finith\'92 piece of that nature painted by

together with that\ of the engraver and his capacity forthis reafon book-prints hand\ in need of explanation but other prints not for the golour is in the\ one what the writing is in the other.\ iv of the difference between engraving and etching.\ ccor ding to the general opinion and not without rea.\ fon erching is accounted more loofe and defigner like than\ engraving becaute there is no difference between erching and draw.\ ing as to the handling but the difference berween drawing and en.\ is very great the management of the needle is the same\ thar of chalk or the pen the place lies ffat and firm like the\ paper to draw upon but we find the contrary in engraving wherein\ the graver is held almod parallel with the plate and the larter is\ moreable on cuikion or sandbag and as to force there is alloless\ occafion for it in erching than engraving.\ now to prove that etching mutt needs be more deligner-like than\ engraving let us only make our remarks on both in the courte of\ their bulinets each having delign before him and then we shall find\ the reafon to be that in the one both the drawing and plate are\ ixt before the arcid and he only moves his hand whereas the otper\ cannor go forward wirhout firring the plate beingcontinually rurning and boch the hund and arm employed in directing the graver by\ which means engraversare often hindered from perceiving the dit-\ terence berween their work and the pattern before part nay the\ whole be tiniined wherefore in my opiniph eiching is ixperior te\ engravingin exaltnels and speed fay in speed becaute three or more\ plates\ of engraving.\ chap alfo\ plates may be etched before one can be engraved etching\ we\ moft defigner-like becaute of its near affinity with drawing daily experiment for where one painter or deligner engraves for his\ pleafure an hundred take to erching and make good progress\ therein becaute of the flow advances in engraving compared to etch-\ ing whether in figures or buildings but elpecially landskip and\ fince painters of deligners care not to have their defigas cenfured and\ corrected by others they chufe rather to erch them themfelves than\ to fet about engraving an art not to be maftered without much ex-\ pence of time in getting knowledge how to handle the tool whereby it would become rather labour than diverfion.\ many engravers etch for pleafure becaute of its eafiness but fel.\ dom any etcher handles the graver unless in cafe of neceffity to\ this perhaps it may be objected that as each painter or deligner has particular choice wherein he labours moft as one in the ordonnance another in nicety of drafc and third in the neat finithing of fome\ particular things therefore the tiule of designer-like in etching is\ not ablolutely due to painters or deligners to which anfiver that\ undoubtedly the word muft not be underftood to relate to modern de-\ figners becaute it was in ufe before erching was brought to its prefent\ perfection as appears by caracci titian antome temperta c excelled in delign and ufed the needle with no other view than\ to give the world the deligns which they counted capital and moft.\ praife-worthy for the encouragement and confideration of the less\ knowing whereby we plainly perceive that their incention was only\ to putforth their own performances in such manner as fafely to be re-\ lied on accordingly we fcarce fee any more in them than an out line but this is to firm and correlt that however tlightly the other parts\ may be feratcht thefe works thus of their own hands are more\ valued than thofe of the belt and molt famous engravers or etchers.\ we have an example in the print of the woman by the well eicht by\ caracot himself how much it differs from that done by le potre and\ another by bishop whata vaft difference is there between perrier'\ and bishop\'92 works as to the deligner likencts and loofencts of hand\ ling and in landskips between titians and perelles could if\ need required produce more proofs of the anciquity of the word\ defgner-like but shall wave them and acquaint the reader how\ oddly took to etching and how ftrangely drudged before could\ gain my point.\ no having\ of

fcarce intel-\ lisitie my father feeing this could not forbear laughing and for\ hemour sake gave two or three of my proofs to bartbolet and he\ agzin to nstalis the famous engraver who beffowed on me some little\ ihitructien and fmall copper-plare to try on but what drudgery\ hed urdergone before ferarcht this beautiful plate boses book of\ eiching happening to be publifhed about that time ileft off plaguing\ myfelf and cheerfully fer about plitting of wood providing needles boiling grounds cleaning plates buying aqua fortis wax e before iknew of no betrer ground than thick and foul oil out\

far facceeding according to my with happened to fee some prints of\ vouet from france which fpurred my curioficy and should cer\ fainly hive made early and good progress had not my father been fear-\

trath of this ged knows vet had faved candle and ufed more\ day-light for it perhaps my old age might have proved more com-\ fortable to me butalas thofe two noble sifters painting and eich-\ ifg are now vanifhed with my sight.\ let the readerjudge whether he ever heard of firanger way of\ eiching however mention it here to thew that diligent man getting\ of engraving.\ better inftruction may in time gain his point its certain that few young men would have had patience enough to drudge as without inftruction but that an induftrious tyro after leaving\ his mafter may postibly improve through diligence and study is very\ natural even to as to excel him in neatness smoothness and expedi-\ tion as well in erching as engraving mean in the use of the graver\ and needle but not in knowledge by knowledge undertland keeping the likeness of beautiful face hands and feet according\ to what we fay in the fecond chapter that the knowledge confifts in correlt our-line proportion light and shade and peripective for\ we commonly fee the greatell faults committed in the aforelaid parts for want of knowledge and not inuring themfelves to drace by hand\ large things after small and the centrary but accultoming them-\ felves to squaring practice not difficult to swincherd'\'92 boy if he\ underffood the divition of squares and management of chalk but they\ may yet be erroneousenough in tracing their object on the plate though\ drawn upon squares for miffing the out-line in the leaft either inwardly\ of outwardly it prefently becomes too lirtle or too big but the tyro\ can not fee this for want of due knowledge and tho he may be fen-\ fible that here or there he has little miffed the our-line yet he\ palles it over as matter of no great moment and if he propofe to\ help it in the erching or engraving he may poffibly forget it before\ he come to far in the work he commonly thinks no farther than\ what is already on the plate whence we may eafily conclude that he\ who knows not what conflitutes beaury can be as little fenlible that mall difference in face rm or hand is of any great confequence.\ another difficulty no less than the former is that tho the tyro have\ the out-line correctly drawn on the plite yet he may ranover it when\ he comes to sbade or batch and as this frequently happens shall here\ give the reafon of it.\ in either engraving or eiching any thing the off-work whether\ buildings landskip or even the grounds ought always to be begus\ fift that by referving the principal things for the laft the hand may\ be prepared to handlethem with more boldness now the tyro being\ to eagrave or etch ground behind his figure be it naked or dreft he\ will not only especially in engraving end his harching againtt the\ out-line but fomerimes exceed it whereby the parts whether arm leg or hand muff needs lofe their true proportion and quality and\ thus the almoff imperceptible and tender rifing mufcles foldsand hol\ xiii\ of engraving.\ are made even and confequently fliff and formal neverthelefs\ the work goes on and when they come to fee the miftake they fcrape burnith and rub to bring it right again which grant is well enough\ in cafe of need but alas how feldom is it prattifed if it be fome-\ thing of no great contequence it remains as it was without further\ iafpedion thisl know not by hearfay bat experience wherefore\ they who have an laclination for engraving should apply to painter\ for lattraction in beautral proportion and in drawing every thing by\ hard wheeker prints drawings paintings plailter-figures even the\ lite xtolf for painters firff reach the theory or knowledge of pro\ pertion and then the practice of colouring whereas many engravers\ begin with the pridice or handling.\ as for the straping turnisbing and rubbing eut before-mentioned it is point which ought to be well underftood becaufe it affets\ not either the too great darkneis or hardnets of the hatching but the\ ost-line as shall thew by the example of the faces in plate\ ixii.\ in the pace the hatch\'92 ground runs over the outline of the\ check whereby it appears more funk in as in that of and thus\ the out-line is loff now this face being to be finithed and the\ check brought right again to much muft be fcraped off within the\ line as to give the check irs former swell and if the face be\ fourth part less the difference will be to much the greater epc-\ cially in portrait and greater sill if it be in profile as face thews wherein we fee how little foever be taken off with the ground\ from the tip of the nofe mouth and chin it will produce another\ aspect whence tis evident what vall alceration this muft caute\ in the likenets.\ in this art as well as painting it is conflant rule to begin\ with the ground or back-work and engravers and erchers do it for\ the fame reafon as painters for when the principal figures are fr-\ nished the whole piece is reckoned as good as done the general re.\ ronching is only to bring harmony or keeping into the work here\ fomewhar more strength there more faintness oc but what we\ now fpeak of to wit scraging concerns engraving only whereas in etching nothing is done but stopping unlets things are already\ bil.\ ii\ of engraving.\ chap it be asked whether what is flopped up can be repaired before\ tis bit as in when the hatchings which takes away the swell\ from the checks is stopped up with stop ground whether then the\ former roundness can not be again ferch\'92 out with fine needle on\ the same ground that all may bite together antwer that this will\ make bad work but if fomething be wanting it muft be touched\ up with the graver however shall thew another method make\ burnither pretty hot and rub it gently and speedily over the part you\ would have out and then it will clofe up the harching to that you\ need neither to fop up nor bite now etch thereon what is neceffary.\ and thus all may be bit at once thefe osfervations especially that\ of not carelessly spoiling the out line as in the examples and are\ very needful.\ let any perfon now confider how litile fine ordonnance of fi-\ mous mafter when put out of hand in fuch condition can te like\ the original afnd yet this is too offen the cate however affert that without the former knowledge it is imposfible to become good\ mafter for he who makes blundering defign and perceives not\ the miftakes

affinity\ wils the sbades stipping is fomerimes ufeful in cafe of need when\ we care not to cross-harch on the light and allo when the shades are\ hatched too wide in order to express the reslexions fomerwhat the plain-\ er infeed of crofting them over again especially againff the light tho is better to go over them again with fine single firoke and if\ you find this will nor do then you may with finer needle continue\ the same harching fomewhat further but better method would be to lay it of once as far it ought to be and then somewbat to hop up\ the ends or extremities he who negleds this is obliged to make\ thift with fifging yet that mutt not be too closs the beft way is firff with fine needle to continue the harching little further and\ then with finer to extend it till if come to nothing which we call\ broken haiching as was old vifcher'\'92 way in his boors after cfade whereby he pretily expreffed the colour of face and fetched out\ the man-light-touches stipping is very

lengthened anfiver the same purpose and then you\ can proceed with certainty especially if you ufe the fame needle with\ which the hatching is continued in the light round the relief the\ shades again ought to be fofcened with the fame needle that made\ them then the slipping of the large needle in the shade will not be\ visible fet would you work the laft sipping in the light with\ fimaller needle you may but becaufe the shade ends more fuddenly\ than the relief in the light should ufe no others for the ripping\ is nice point to him who will be curious the stips ought allo\ to be equal fay equally diffant and not to come between the ex-\ tremities of the strokes if it be asked whether any thing harch\'92\ teo wide can be darkened with slipping intlead of third stroke my opinion is that it may and that any flight thing can be per-\ formed in this manner but the work is more tedious things to\ touched up look very neat for by hrong strokes fainter ones more\ foint and points we can very commodioufly darken an object more or\ lets at pleafure bonlanger has in my opinion over-slipp\'92 his\ prints which makes them look rather like ministure than any thing\ elle whereforei can not much commend hipping and why becouse of\ the inequality and hungriness of the points or stips occasioned by\ touching one barder than anoiber whereby in biring one penciraies.\ the copper more than another be the dot ever fo small add to\ this the impesfibilny of making the stips perfectly round they will\ always be more or less lengish as may be easily proved by magnify-\ ing class.\ have feen in engraved prints of gotteins the faint tint upon\ the relief cross -harch\'92 as well as in the shade but this is only pro-\ per for engraving effecially in hligh fmishing becaufe in eiching the crotshatching expreffes coming shade and then it may be\ very well effected by hipping as brosd-lighted objects want not fo\ much darknets in the light.\ now if any thing should happen to be amiss and you\ would beat it out and mend it take proof and fatten it nestly be-\ hind your plate and then beat out what you would have away this\ may be done even to an hair and if you care not to firike on the\ paper you may mark the place with sharp point on the copper to as to fee it which will do as well though the fpoiling proof\ is but trifle vet the proof when once dry is no more fit forthis\ ofe am\ no engraving.\ kili\ ufe wherefore the work muft be done as foon as the proof comes\ from the press for being werted again it will always be uncertain and unlike the plate in order to find thefe lictle places of mishir\ spors with ftill greater eafe mechod which many engravers make\ secret of take fine thread or string and put it crosswife about\ the plate tring it on the edges to that the

this obfervation is good in order to thew the difference\ between carving in stone and chasing in gold or silver but itslike\ wife true that had perrier finithed his drawings as well as santi they\ would have been much finer and more ufeful for its eafier to leave\ out superffuities than make addicions iis not improbable that suntis\ intention by his method of management was that he might\ be of greater service to painters statuaries and chafers than per-\ rier.\ we have affirmed that pietre santi has possibly added much of his\ own now it is alfo not unlikely that perrier drew his objects from\ greater diffance than santi whereby he could not fee all the minute\ parts and can not but at the fame time think that santi defigned\ moft of his bats reliefs affer undamaged within door-work in halls chambers and other inclofed places whereas perrier poffibly took his\ from without door-work luch as pediments froncifpieces frizes and\ the like half eaten up by the weather we might kill fubjoin that per.\ rier worked only to thew the world that fuch excellent things were at\ rome and at the fame time to difplay his light and firm manner\ of drawing whereas santi had not only view to profit but allo\ to be generally ufeful to curious artifts and others how true this is\ let the pirtuess determine.\ a engraving.\ kiii\ as to the right hlandling of batsreliefs think it abfolutely ne-\ ccffary that every thing be etched equally coarse or fine with one and\ tee jame ncedle without any difference with respect to stuffs as being\ the beft method for reprefencing the stone-werf welf unless it were\ bit grey one with fore-ground and offskip when the strokes ought\ to diminith of grow faint according to perspettive.\ there is likewife lirtle obfervation made about the lights of pass-\ reliefs for oftentimes things fainted sharp and in sun-sbine are exhi-\ bited in the plate with common light thro the roundness of the\ srates and fometimes we fee the contrary but thefe are liberties\ which neither erchers nor engravers ought to take he whole pro-\ vince is to imitate let him exaftly follow the beaten path in relation to\ elching bass reliefs sharp light or san shine is very improper and ren\ ders them difagrecable but as for embellishments in sun-hine the mar-\ fer is of lets moment\ ap viii of engraving and the management of the strokes.\ to be wondered that among the many arts and manual\ engroving is to little and etching fo much treated\ of the reafon whereof is palt my apprehention many painters\ and lovers for the encobragement of thole who would make it their\ bufiness or to fhew their skill have earneftly firove to fay fomething\ of it but no engraver has to my knowledge undertaken the task poffibly as not thinking themfelves fufficient for it or elfe becaute\ they would keep it as secret from each other but the moff pro\ bable reafon as think is the late appearance of this art which\ is evident fince the remans till their latter times knew nothing of\ irs certain that engraving as well as painting is founded as much\ on iecory as proffice and that both depend on eftablifhed and politive\ rules which if orderly followed will make man mafter.\ wthy then are they not made publick for the information of the\ curious in what they want to know mutt not he who incends to go\ to certain town or village be firk told where it lies and then\ the ways to it chuting the neareff as befft\ .\ of engraving.\ not frange that more engravers have applied to painting chan\ painters to engraving becaute the latter have to many excellent books for their encouragement publifhed by indicious mafters whereas.\ engravers have not one touching their practice but as every thing has\ its time to we mult hope for it in this.\ nam mora dat vires teneras mora concequit uvas et validas segetes qued fuit herba facit.\ ofs\ perfetting time brings on the tender grape and gives the berby corn its ripning shape.\ in the mean time shall boldly eater

secondly good engraver qualifications laftly whatcon-\ ritutes an agreeable print wherefore we shall now difcuts the ma-\ nagement of the strokes in objects according to their natures and courfes with respett to perspective and as well in erching as engraving toge\ ther with fome examples for illuftrating the point and preventing and\ correcting millakes.\ in plate xxl is wheel marked having spokes or points as allo staf fer upright in the ground croffed by the horizon.\ this wheel thews that each spoke ought to have particular course.\ according to irs turn and that the scrokes muft be governed by the\ extremity of each spoke as may be here feen the foremoft runs cir-\ cular the second eval the third almost freight c compare allo\ the foremoll spoke with the hinder one how much they differ in\ force for approaches and recires which can not be otherwife\ according to perspective again the strokes drawn with ruler and\ running off towards the point of sight grow gradually finer and\ fointer now tho the short or cress barching ought by eftablished\ rule engraving\ book kiii\ to be mere visible and firong than the long yet few are obferyed\ to make any diffinet on therein.\ we have faid before that each object whether fleth scone grounds csc requires particular stroke and among others that\ wood elpecially mult be thick-fircked glong the grain and contequently\ cress patcred with finer stroke but now we thew the contrary for\ the cress ones are frenger than those running with the grain which here\ can not be otherwife if some fay that contradilt myfelf in making\ the crols-drokes thus againtt the grain shall for their sarisfiltion thew mr reafon for it obfervethen that any thing turned has no -\ ther graintean what the chizel makes and as the turner works againt\

hule heed\ ed tho allo founded on certain rules of this art.\ as forthe stoff it thews that the srrokes begnning round from\ below grow breighter as they approach the herizon and above the\ her zin the same but in reverfed manner.\ now let us confider the other example in plate xxl wherein the\ reiring paragets thew the diminution or faminets of the strokes not\ only in fuch but in any other objects according to their diftance and\ going off the one in greater the other in lets degree hereby we\ may plainly difcover the perverfe notion of some men namely that\ diminaticn implies growing scanty or vider see with fingle\ stroke from one end to the other now alcho the offfrokes feem\ neater than the near yet they are not to in falt but as the place di\ minishes so the strokes close and thin in tuch manner that they be ome\ aeither cleter nor more feanty the diminution of the figures and the\ three tskes bears the fame conttruction nevertheless am fentible that manr even old malters do otherwife in handling their retiring\ obje.ts figures trees offship and sky more coartly behind chan\ forwards have even obferved that they clofe-harch the neareff and\ darkeff sky and work wider and wider towards the horizon but this\ more in erching than engraving poffibly to fave the trouble of uing\ or more needles or of fopping up which is properly the point this\ example ans at for do not ask here whether it creates more\ trouble but thew what may poffibly be thought to be of less mo\ ment than in fall it is for intlance place the tbree figures no of engraving.\ gs ten or twelve steps part and at the fame diftances on the parapet three vases alfo numbered whereby may be plainly perceived how much the one differs from the other but altho in thefe figures\ the meaning is fufficiently to be underflood to wit that the further\ they are the more fine and close the strokes become yer have added the\ vafesto them for the sake of thofe who may be curious enough to count\ the strokes when they will find not stroke more or less in the one\ than the other which in the figures would be redious work ob-\ ferve in the next place the ground-sade of each figure againtt the\ parapet each growing faint according to ir diftance and with what\ certainty the accurate tints of the figures may be perceived thereon even to know how much they diminish and grow finer and at the fame\ time how much the light differs bur let it not be thought fufficient that the shades diminith or grow faint and the white remain all ever\ light fince we know that the plan or ground can not thew its levef\ otherwife than by means of light forwards going off darker and\ darber for initance were white figure or white stone flanding for-\ wards and you would place fuch another further in where the ground\ is darker you mult govern yourfelf by the groand where the firgt object\ fands as being subject to the fame rule if things be well finithed.\ if the plan or ground be fnished the figures ought to be so likewife are they airily handiel ani brordlighted the ground mut be the same.\ and tho the ground in its colour be more or less dark yet that is.\ not regarded in this cae becaule we are peaking only of the diminn-\ tion of the tints confi-ing of white and black suppote the floor\ were of white mla ble and the figares the same or in white draperies the foremoft would be breadlighted and the mere diffant less and less\ white were it even in sun shine nay if the light came from bebind or from assde the most diffant would only keep an utmoft heightening and killless were the colours exprefied in it as they who underftand\ perspective well know nor canit be otherwife as may be feen in the\ firtt example in the child handholding the end of the hindmoll spoke which planly appears to have little orno whiceness and as for the stuffe\ of the objects as linnen cloth and fuch like some may rather think\ them poffible to be so worked than the nated becaute having already.\ engraved forwards as neat and fine as may be we can therefore further\ in not express any thing finer or neater but fay that as things having the urmoft neatness do not become neater by disfance nor al.\ terin the eye but difappear fo when the objects are very remote neither silk linnen or woollen is to be diftinguithed to far as concerns\ the\ of engraving.\ book kiil\ the histening bur the coarse parts always keep their forms and this\ obfervation respelts not only the three stufts but alfo figures stones greands trees cc here tome perhaps may fay how can the\ strokes postibly unite with the light when they as they retire ought\ to be clofer and clefer especially with the air which on the ho-\ rizon is clear and bright and free from clouds unless they widen\ more and more towards the horizon were they ever fo faint to\ which anfwer as experience will prove that when the strokes thus\ thin and grow fant in their going off they certainly difappear and\ he away nay become at latt invisible and unite enough with the\ ight even were it sunshine tho they be ever so closc and fuch length think the gravercan go when skilfully managed in etching he needlecan do the fame by flopping up.\ however queition not but my propolition will be caxed with im-\ poffibility and purzling novelcy especially by fuch as are not thorough\ engravers who may blame me for thus dilcloting the grounds of this\ roble art and to plainly thewing truth but my anfwer in the\ irf place is that find myself obliged in duty to do fo fince allmy\ withestend towards irs arriving at the greateft perfeltion secondly becaute what lay down is prelcribed by certain rules of the mathe.\ maties the few are sensible that the art of engraving in general flows therefrem and that different objects require different handlings but rather believe that good manner of drawing will eafily lead to\ engraving notion true enough in erching tho even therein the\ point lies moft in the biting and stopping as to engraving you\ mull certainly be converfant with the handling and force of the graver two pomts not to be artained without great experience tho in the\ begnning tis better for an ercher to have no handling at all becaute\ he may then gradually the better bring the graver to the needle and\ in an umformity of strokes adapt the one to the other and make them\ harmonious whereas fome relying too much on the graver ule it\ here and there in their flovenly works without any difference and\ that with incredible carelessnets fometimes cutting foreground stone of stem of tree neat and smooth which ought to be rough and\ knobby when at the fame time they are working face or marble fi-\ gare with the needle this mult be owing either to their carelessnels or defire of eafe or their ignorance lince fuch doings are againtt\ reaton and common instruction.\ could mention many fuch diforderly prints among others there'\ one of the raifing of lazarys done by berry wheren the figure of\ lazarus of engraving.\ chap with to much of the linney as comes about his bodyf is\ eich\'92 and the reff of the linnen lying on the ground nearty en\ groved whereby one part looks like linnen and the other like silk.\ the one is here and there sipp\'92 and the other is not but perhaps\ the plate was not well bit it alfo fometimes happens that we are\ obliged to rub out things which makes good my affertion for if the\ fault lie in the plate the mafter ought as much as poffible to help\ it by his knowledge and judgment could he handle the graver why did he not thew it and make things agree and if he was not\ mafter of the graver why did he not better follow the strokes of the\ needle had he inflead of cross harching made the strokes fomewhat\ finer and criple harched them and ufed some sipping then it would have\ been paftable\ there is another print with an ornament round it reprefenting sacrifice of flora or the spring which is allo wreechedly erch\'92 and\ engraved forthe foremolt figures as charity piety and time and\ every thingelfe on the fore-ground are neatly finished and mofity en\ graved but the figures on the fecend ground to flight and poorty\ lcdld as not to have any agreement with the others the strokes\ even look as if they were dabb\'92 on and drawn with thaking hand inflead of growing fainter every where which would make the work\ neat and intire this arciff might have known that he could not\ make the graver and the ncedle agree.\ featible some will determipne that many things fuch as wa-\ ter silver gold and such like smooth and shining bodies can be more\ conveniently express\'92 with the graver than the needle but in my\ opinion skilful hand can give every thing it naruralness.\ tis very rrange to me in the qld prints that the mafters have\ in nothing reprelented the natural qualities but eich\'92 every thing after\ one manner whether wudities draperies air grounds of stone ex-\ cept water and yet not this with thin and thick strokes but only\ crots parallels and thofe very unlike offentimes clole and then wide as if they were fcratch\'92 gain they have not expresed any colour and always made the water dark and brown now to create difference\ in sining bodies my thoughts are that you firft lay the strokesiffrong\ and parallel and of areafonable widch from each other and thea clote\ them by putting thinner between mean in water black marble polithed steel and fuch like for by this mechod we produce is\ tain stir shewing the smoothnets and glitter.\ ii\ engraving.\ bool kiii\ it be asked why in eiching the strokes which are close and\ thick fomdimes fy ap tho the plact be in good condition and the\ ground netther burnt nor too hard antwer that have found by\ experience that when the water is too flrong and at firff bires roo\ tharp we muft then take our chance becaute the place being cold can not grow warm to foon as the ground which therefore is jorcibly\ liffed from the plate and prefencly rifes and the fooner if the strokesbe\ clofe and thick which happens not to cafily in the render parts where by the thinness and widch of the strokes the water has not to much\ power to get underthem to prevent this the water mult be some\ what seeatened and the ground and plate gradually made warm in or-\ der to make them unite with each other especially in cold weather for in the warm months of tune tuly and auguft is not neceffary becaute we then ule harder grounds.\ now to know whether the ground be in good condition make scratch of two with large needle in pare place of the place and\ if the ground come out of the strokes like dubt it is then roo bard but if in curls is in good temper especially if you can blow them off.\ if they cansor be wiped off with foff feather bur stick to the cround is then foo foft this is nice point ir fomerimes happened to me that here and there they remained in the strokes.\ some etchers allo frequeatly give themfelvesneedless trouble when\ they pur our the out-lines which are made too frong on the light side with srop- ground which you know alwaysllows more or lessover them especially if the place be hor but confider what trouble they mutt\ atterwards have when the our line is gone for they are obliged to\ renew with the graver all the strokes running againit it wherefore the beft way is to trace the drawing nearly on the place and mark\ at firfl

great mes is arrived at to great perfection hope the following figure will\ hot be unacceptable to the profeffors and lovers of it.\ figure of the black art or merro-tinco.\ here you fee young and plump virgin of freth complexion and amiable countenance drelsd in black vetvet lined and faced with\ sky-blae powdered with gold glittering stars she has broad gold\ girdle embroidered with black bats which diminith towards the arms.\ her head attire is wanton and modiss adorned here and there with\ small flowers about her neck is gold chain to which hangs medal exhibiting burning alfar and thefe words ma gnr\ brit annie in her right hand is small tool like lan\ cet together with feather and in the left table whereon is\ painted an head on black ground reprefenting nature she poifes\ airily on one leg as if the were dancing.\ explanation the art is reprefented young and plump to fignify that the is kill\ growing the black velvef gown and stars imply that like the stars\ the is lprung from dark night the golden girdle and bats give us\ to underfland that tho her productions are not very lafing yet\ the makes great gains the chain with the medal and alrar there\ on proclaims her lufre and the words round it allude to an offer-\ ing of thanks to great britain to whom the owes her origin and glors\ table with the figure of natare thews that the exsels therein.\ the reft explains itfelf.\ why this beautiful figure bears the name of the black heard tho her prabtice fufficiencly gives us the reafos to wis\ that the proceeds from black and tho the art of etching allo feems\ engraving.\ book-kxiii\ be derived from black yet tis done in quite different manner for the former comes forth from the light and the latter from the\ shade the one heightens and the other shadows.\ we have already faid that erching is in fpeed fuperior to en.\ graving but the black art is more expeditious than either of them and in nearness has not it fellow it may even compare with painting how foff and fivent foever abaring for the colours indeed\ in duration and wear tis the weakeff but on the other hand its\ expedicioufnets brings in more money.\ this noble art is preferable to any engraving in reprefenting uncom-\ ion lights as candle torch lamp fire and the like wherefore\ think it does not improperly bear the name of the black art nor to be of above fhry vears flanding and yet is arrived\ at to great perfection tho other arts have required more time but\ englind where the climare is healthful and temperate has contri-\ duted much to its nearness and luftre there it

to painters for three realons for ir eafinets in learning forirs nearnets and lattly for it conveniency.\ tis cassty feurned by any one who is accuftomed to draw on\ grounded or blue paper becaute there is difference in operation\ berween the fcraping on the plate and heightening on the grounded\ paper beginning with the greatef light and sparing the shade as we\ have thewed in our drawing book rouching the handling of crajons\ or chalk-pencils. herefore affirm that it comes nearer to painting\ than esching or engraving and tis to eafily apprehended mean\ in theory as to be learned in lets than three days tis nest and free from soil and smell as not requiring either\ stop ground greate or aqua-fortis.\ eafily the conveniency arifing from it may be eatily conjectured as is more expedicions than either esching or engraving..\ bol\ of engraving.\ chap many are to eager in this art to legrs seat scraping as to neg-\ let the principal part the ostline which they often over run and can-\ not be brought right again and when cerreff defgs is wanting in or print what judicious perfon will approve it indeed we can not manage here as in etching where the our line may be traced on the\ plate with needle for the whire fometimes goes out or is to faint\ as fcarce to be feen belides its inconvenient to scrape figures againft\ light ground tho artifts generally ule to work the figure firft and\ then the offskip against it now to prevent this inconvenience firft\ fcrape your back-ground and pare the neat out line rather keeping\ little from it till the figure be finithed afcerwards you may gently\ fcrape nearer thus you will not fo eafily run over the outline as\ when you begin with the figure.\ there is great difference berween the erching engraving and\ scraping of painters and that of engravers for the former making it\ only their divertion do not finith things to very highly as the latter\ who have been brought up therein and make it their conflant bulinets\ painters are fatisfied with thewing only good defign and general de-\ corum becaute while they were neatly to finith one place they can\ work another.\ this art is certainly ealy to perfon of good

plate is in do like\ the painters firft to dead colour with bread parts and then prip now having proof you can give the work it main heightening and thus\ with patience finith every part point requiring neither much time\ nor study but little obfervation. there is publifhed print of little satyr which in an hour time fcraped loofein my hand as\ walked in garden and after proof taken
