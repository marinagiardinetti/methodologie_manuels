employ- ments and have diftinguished themfelves by works of ingenuity which have met with the protection and encouragement of the judicious part of mankind we need not point out the injury done to vouth by the neglect of this neceffary study and how greatly many in years of maturity lament the deficiency of it as loss to them- felves and families no wonder it should be deemed one of the chief accomplifh- ments in human life and thought worthy even of royal patronage as well as the ho- hourable regard paid to it by the different socieries in all of which fpirited emula- tion is excited among the proficients by premiums given to fuch as produce the moft correct and perfect defigns or imitations it has ever been the misfortune of thofe who have profeffed to lay down rules for the attainment of any art or science to leave them enveloped with difficulties which if not utterly infuperable at leaft difcourage the learner from proceeding in study which he can have little hopes will ever reward his purfuit from hence we may reafonably infer that the faid profeffors were totally unac- quainted if not with the theory at leaft with the practical part of what they under- took to teach others and that the instructions they have given were founded rather upon bare suppofition of their efficacy than upon the furer bafis of long and repeated experience which alone could have infured their success and from which with all due deference to the judicious whofe sanction we shall at all times be ambitious to deferve we may venture to anfwer for the practicability of our own to obviate every objection and to remove all thofe difficulties which had fo long blocked up the path of science and retarded if not wholly impeded the pupil in his progress to the temple of fame was the chief view in compiling the fubfequent little treatife over and above the improvements made in illuftrating the feveral arts hitherto fo imperfectly and unintelligibly explained we have introduced directions for scraping in merzofinto which in this edition are ftill farther enlarged and which as they have never been before attempted in any books of this kind we flatter ourfeives will be the more acceptable especially when it shall appear from the rules laid down for the performance of this art that it is fo eafy to be attained that tolerable profi- ciency in drawing will enable any one to undertake it with all imaginable prospect of success the reader will alfo find in this impreffion the addition of very ufeful problem in the article of perspective illuftrated by new plate as this book is chieffy intended for the ufe of young practitioners we have pur- pofely avoided all absirufe expreffions and obfolete terms contenting ourfelves with such familiar stile as we judged moft likely to inform thofe minds we would with to improves vet as the ideas of an artift are not wholly to be conveyed without some neceffary terms peculiar to each branch we have taken care to explain fuch as could not be omitted without manifest injury to the work by familiar words of fynoni- mous tendency wherever they occur to that we apprehend we have not left the leaft stumbling-block for the reader to encounter gener al al instrugtions ery young beginner should endeavour to improve his memory with the beauties of the moft excellent paintings and prints taking notice of the harmony of their different parts as well as of the reafons for the disposition of the lights and shades which will by degrees improve the ideas to degree of excellency and make the practice eafy and familiar as the hand will be more ready to execute thofe objects the mind has fo clearly conceived the ufe of this accompliffiment is vifible in many who though not able to execute yet by accuttoming themielves to this study become excellent judges and are with great propriety termed connoiffeers in the polite arts of painting engraving it will alfo be of effential service to the pupil to attend to the

attempts the second and fo of the second before he proceeds with the third not endeavouring to become mafter of the whole at once which will only perplex his ideas and weary him in the purfuit of what he will never by this means be likely to attain whereas by proceeding gradually the rules will be found much more eafy and practicable and confequently the study infinitely more pleafing and encouraging drawing the introductory lines with the features and limbs separately endeavour to imitate perpendicular or upright strokes and then horizontal or parallel lines but without ufing the ruler and if care be taken few examples of this sort will give you perfection when you have attained this proceed to the curved and twining lines obferving carefully their different inclinations and when you can with eafe perform thefe pruceed to draw the out lines of human face as the eyes nofe mouth and ears and from them proceed to the parts of the body as the arms hands legs rc see plate the above muft be but faintly skerched fo as to be eafily taken down with rubber in order to make the neceffary alterations before finishing prosiles and ovals when you are become mafter of the former you

respect to the reft and keeping the proportions as exact as poflible after pro- ceeding with great care in the above you may begin the ourline of the body as in plate ii whole figures with the proportions and dimensions of the thuman body if on thorough examination you find you can eafily imitate the different fea- tures and parts of the body you may begin the whole figure by iketching the whole very lighrly with your pencil or charcoal examining the proportion of the different parts taking it down with rubber and altering where it shall appear neceffary when you have brought it as near as peffible to your original proceed to finiffi with the crow-quill pen and indian ink beginning with the head then proceeding to the shoulders body arms hands hips legs and feet taking care to correct any er- fors in the pencil skerch the remains of which will be eafily erazed with rubber refrain from the ufe of compaffes till after very minute inspection with the eye and then if the fault can not be difcovered proper application of them will greatly affift the pupil to remedy the defect having by clofe attention and practice improved his ideas to far as to be able to compleat figure in out-lines we shall pro- ceed to instruct him in the drapery or cloathings but before we quit this subject it will be neceffary in this place to give him the beft method of afcertaining the proportions and dimenfions of the several parts of the human body by raifing perpendicular on the place you intend for the middle of the figure and divide it into heads and from fuch form scale to regulate the proper distances but as it has been common to divide the figure into ten parts we have though we do not to well approve of this method given an example of both of thefe methods together with rules for the iluftration of each respectively the proportion of figure divided into eight heads see plate iii the length of the head is from the crown of the head to the bottom of the ehin line ruled through the second divifion will directly crofs she paps of the breafts the third divifion will fall near the naval the fourth across the privities which is exactly the middle of the figure the fifth croffes the middle of the thigh the sixth is juft below the bend of the knee the seventh falls little below the calf of the leg the eight extends to the bottom of the heel obferve that when the arms are extended at full length in direct line the full extent from the middle fingers of each hand is exactly the length of the figure from the middle of the collar bone to the end of the middle finger meafures four heads viz the firft to the bend of the shoulder the second to the elbow the third to the wrift and the fourth to the fingers ends from shoulder to shoulder in man of common size meafures exactly two headss but there is no precife standard for the breadth of the limbs which vary according to the bulk of the perfon and the movement of the mufcles the proportion of figure divided into ten parts see plate firft of thefe divifions extends from the crown of the head to the under lip the second little below the collar bone and line drawn through this part of the figure will pafs over the middle of the shoulders the third divifion will make line juft below the paps of the breaft the fourth will reach juft below the navel the fifth which is the middle of the figure directly acrofs the privities the sixth will pass over the middle of the thighs the seventh croffes the bend of the knee the eight directly through the calves of the legs the ninth reaches half way from the calf to the bottom of the heel which deter- mines the tenth and laft divifion of the figure the young beginner will find the foregoing rules of infinite advantage to which we would advife him to give due application till they become ftrongly impreffed on his mind but care muft be taken that too striet an obfervance of the preceding dimen- fions may not deftroy that variety of compofitions to abfolutely neceffary nor will the preservation of the same proportion be always allowed in the subject which mr. ho- farth in his chapter of proportion very judicioutly remarks in his obfervations upon the celebrated statue of apollo belvidere where he fays can not throw ftronger light on what has been faid hitherto of proportion than by animadverting on re- markable beauty in the apollo defvidere which hath given it the preference even to the antinous mean super-addition of greatness to at leaft as much beauty and grace as is found in the latter in in the same apartment at rome are to be feen thefe two mafter-pieces of art where in viewing the antinans the spectator is filled with admirations when the apollo ftrikes him with surprife and as trawellers express themfelves with an appearance of fomething more than human which they are always at lofs to describe but the ef- feet of this is they fay the mere extraordinary as the difproportion upon examination is evident to every common eye the foundation of defign is perfect knowledge of all the parts of the human body but no more is neceffary to painters than that which relates to the bones and the principle mufcles that cover them there is an abfolure neceffity to be thoroughly acquainted with the forms and joints of the bones becaufe the dimenfions are often altered by motion and likewife to underftand the office and situation of the mufcles fince the moft firiking truth in defign depends upon them as it is indispentably neceltary that the pupil should have some knowledge in ana- romy it being the fundamental part of defign and enables artifts to difcover the beau- ries of the antique it is therefore earneftly recommended the student to pay fome at- rention to ii as all that is neceffary for draughtfmen is very eafily retained of drapery when you have drawn the outlines of the figure you want to cloath faintly with charcoal kketch the out-lines of your drapery lightly with the feveral foldsy remembering that they muft not cross each other due regard muft likewife he had to the qualiry of the drapery as stuffs and woollen cloth are more harth than silk which is always flowing and eafy remember that the drapery muft not stick too clofe to the body but let it feem to ffowr eafy about it and yet appear fo that the motion of the figure be free and natural be careful that the drapery supposed to be blown by breeze of wind all flow one way and draw the parts nexr the body before thofe which fly off the garments muft always bend with the figure and if you make the drapery almoft clofe to the body the fmaller muft be the folds and if quite clofe there muft be no folds but only faint shadow to reprefent the bend of that part of the body which it covers ie is neceffary the student should take every opportunity of improvement in this ufeful branch by remarking the folds in the drapery of gentle- men and ladies according to their feveral pofitions by this unerring rule of nature the learner will greatly heighten his own ideas and give superior excellence to his work thus far may serve to give the young draughtfman general idea of drapery but that he may not be at loss in perfecting himfelf in this neceffary branch of the art we have here fubjoined the following more particular instructions viz be careful to avoid overcharging your figure with superfluity of drapery let as much of the form of the body as poffible be shewn underneath it when the draperies are large throw them into as few folds as you can and ler thefe be large and graceful on on the contrary fet thofe which are clofe to the body and short be loofened by small folds judiciouly placed which will be the means of avoiding that stiffness which for want of this caurion appears when the drapery is made to fit too ftrait and makes the figure feem as if wrapped round with bandage instead of being gracefully cloathed when much drapery is required let the greater part if poffible be thrown into shadow obferve that the folds which fall in the light muft have fuch foft and tender shadows as may make them fir hollow from the body and not feem to girt too clofely to it let the folds be properly contrafted and avoid ftrait lines as much as poffible judicious repetition of folds in circular form greatly contribute to charac- terife fore-thortened limb in fixed arritudes let the drapery appear likewife motionlets unlets exposed to the air but the drapery of figures moving with great agility should teem to play as if agitated by the wind but in proportion only to the velocity of the figures in motion we can not conclude this subject withour giving this very wfeful caution viz ler the pupil be carefl how he fiudies statues and remember that the beft of them are only memorials of thofe great artifts whofe lives were fpent in endeavouring to express their own idea of perfection which varied according to the different tafte ef each and the nature of the materials upon which they wrought and let it be likewife remembered that there is stiffnets which should be fiudiouly avoided in copy even though correct one made after the fineft statue which will never convey any idea but that of statue whereas there is fuch freedom obfervable in the imitations of nature as evidently diftinguiffes them from thofe taken either from marble or plaifter of light and shade the proper distribution of light and shade in picture is abfolntely neceffary to be known as it not only determines the proper distance of one object from another without which the whole would be an undiftinguished mafs of confufion but it gives likewife to each respective object its substance roundness and effect therefore having out-lined the folds and the other parts of drapery you may next attempt the shadowing of your figure obferving the following method shadow the drawing with the pencil or pen in which great care is required firft obferve from which side the light comes in which if natural ought to be from the right or left for when the light comes in the middle it is called an artificial light as proceeding from fome artificial luminary as candle lamp lay your shades rather faint at firft fo that you may heighten them at pleafure where neceffary for you may at any time darken your shadows when you can not lightenthem remember that your shades muft be all on the fame side of the figure that is to fay if the right side of the face be in shade fo muft the same side of the body arm leg cc your shades muft all be faint as they approach the light the strength gra- dually decreating towards the extremities to prevent harth appearance as that is never-failing sign of bad workman when one part of the body projects over or before another the part projecting muft receive ftronger light thofe parts that bend inward muft be made fo much the darker and shadowed deepeft next the light two equal lights muft never be made in the fame picture the ftrongest light should fall upon the middle of the piece where the principal figures ought to fland diminithing gradually towards the extremities stump made of paper or glove-leather rolled hard and cut almoft to point like pencil is ufeful if you shade with the pencil red chalk or crayons to blend the shades and foften them into each other as alfo where they appear too ftrong to weaken them with the aforefaid roll by examining nature you will improve your ideas in light and shade as well as in out-lines and be enabled to form right judg- ment of the truth of your drawing the indian ink may be prepared for few different shades by rubbing it more or less in water on marble stone cut in hollows for that purpofe referving one of the hollows for the water of drawing landscapes thiis will give the student an inexhauftible fund of amnfement from the variery of subjects which nature conflantly fupplies for his observance and imitation and in order to improve in this study the heft method is to adhere to the rules before laid down with regard to the human body by beginning with the moft fimple objects as the out-lines of cottages trees cc for which reafon we shall give few exam- ples in each with their proper shades but would advife the pupil not to be too hafty in the shadowing before he is perfect in the out-line and as it is impoffible he should excel in landicape without fome knowledge of perspective we shall give fome directions fuitably illuftrated with problems as neceffary affistant to the prac- titioner which will prevent his being imposed on by faulty and incorrect originals where the ignorance of perspective makes the whole landicape appear unnatural and diftarted of perspective the firft thing neceffary to learn before we proceed to the problems is an ex- planation of the feveral rechnical terms ufed in the practice of this artz and these are as follow the bafe or fundamental line is the bottom of the drawing or that part of the ground on which the perfon is supposed to fland looking towards the point of sight perpendicular is an upright line with respect to any part of the bafe parattel lines are equidittant from each other as the horizon to the bafe the horizon is the moft distant part where the clouds teem to touch the earth and limits the sight the point of sight is that part of the horizen where all the vifual rays center rays are beams of light conveying the likenets of any thing to the sight and the knowledge thereof to the mind points of disfance are fet off on the horizontal line at equal diftances on each side of the point of sight diagonal lines are thofe drawn from the points of diftance to the end of the baic line the abridgment of the square is the line where the diagonals crots the vifual rays and muft always be parallel to the bafe this is only of ufe when the sight is limited by perpendicular as the end of church or room the foregoing terms are illuftrated in plate iv fig the point of direct view is when the object is feen in front as houfe or geo- metrical elevation raifed from ground-plot comprehending an equal space on both sides the point of sight the point of oblique view is when the object is feen fideways for inftance of canal with fome remarkable buildings when the perfon drawing the faid view is placed on the bafe line oppofite to the buildings fo that the ray of light may be more oblique and the buildings lets fore-shortened and appear to greater advantage accidental points are thofe where objects end in the horizontal line not in the points of sight or diftance ferving for streets houfes chairs cc taking diffe- rent directions jchnography is plan of ground-plot to be faifed in perspective scenography is bringing any thing raifed in perspective from an ichnographic plan to its proper proportion that all objects may be diminished in picture the fame as in nature as the art of perspective is constructed on geomerrical principles it may be ne- ceffary previous to the rules themfelves to demonstrate the following introductory operations from point in given line to raife perpendicular see fig ii plate iv draw the given line then fet one foot of the compaffes in and extending them to rather more than half the length of the line ftrike the arch and with the same extent of the compaffes fet one point in and describe the arch then without altering the compaffes fet one foot in and fveep the arch rule through the points to interfect the arch at ro and draw the line from t to which is the perpendicular required to raife perpendicular upon it being the center of the given line see fig iii plate iv divide the bafe line into two equal parts then extend the compaffes to any distance greater than bor and with one foot in tweep the arch de then with the fame extent of compaffes fet one foot in and sweep the arch and from the interfection of the two arches at draw line to the center of the bafe tine at and you have the perpendicular required to to draw line parallel to or equidiftant from another given line see fig iv plate iv extend the compaffes to the diftance of the parallel required then with one foot in any point of the line given as in sweep the circle hi again without altering the compaffes fet one foot in another point as in and defcribe the circle then rule the line touching the ourward parts of the two circles and you will their have the parallel to the line given to bifect or divide given line intotwo equal parts see fig plate taken with your compaffes any diffance greater than half the given line proceed with ohne foot of them in to describe the arch and without altering the diftance fetting one foot in sweep the arch and thefe arches will interfect each other in the points which joined by perpendicular will crofs in the middle point hlaving three given points not in right line how to turn circle through them see fig vi plare iv three points being fixed as at and proceed to join them by the right linex and then by fig bffect the line with the line hi which being done divide the line with the line and from the middle where thefe lines center extend your compaffes to and tweep the arch fure way of drawing an oval see fig vii plate iv divide the given line into four equal parts one feot of the compaffes being fet in defcribe circle withour altering the extent of the compaffes frem tweep the circle then extend the compaffes one foot in and tweep the arch with the fame excent fer one foot in and turn the arch the inter- fections muft be united by perpendicular from to then proceed with one foot of the compaffes in to defcribe the arch and with the fame extent of com- paffes fer one foot in and turn the arch another certain method see fig viil plate iv rule given line then place one foot of the compaffes in and describe the circle then with the same extent of compaffes on the line in the fup- pofed point describe the circle and through the points where the two circles interfect rule the perpendicular then having one foot of the com- paffes fet in extend the other to as to tweep the arch to the lower exxtremi- ties of the circles then without altering the compafies fet one feot in and turn the arch to join the upper extremities by the preceding examples it is evident that an oval of any form or size may be construeted at pleature only obferving always to fet the compaffes at an equal dif rance from the given line on the perpendicular pradical examples in perspective to draw square pavement in perspective see fig ix plate iv supposing you have piece of pavement confifting of pieces of marble each foot square your firft bufiness is to draw an ichnographical plan which is thiis performed an exact square being made to the size of your intended plan proceed to divide both horizon and bafe into eight equal parts and from each divition in the bafe to his oppofite point in the horizon rule perpendicular lines and divide the sides into the fame number ruling acrofs from point to point parallel lines to that of courfe your pavement will be divided into square feet as the eight feet in length being mulriplied by the eight in breadth produce the number of pieces contained in the whole then rule from corner to corner diagonal lines and you will have your ground-plot as in the fame figure now to throw this ine perspective draw another square as before directed and divide the bafe line only into eight equal parts fix your point of sight at in the center of the horizon then to every divifion in the bafe rule lines from the fame point and proceed to rule diagonals from to and from to to answer thofe in the ground-plot and you will then have your square reduced to the triangle and from the point where the line is interfected by the diagonal to the oppofite interfection where the line is inter- feeted by the diagonal hi then rule parallel line which is the abridgment of the square from the reft of the lines which go from the bafe to the point of sight through the points which are interfected by the diagonals rule parallel lines and you willthen have your square pavement laid in true perspective as in fig plate iv to find the height and proportion of objects appearing above the horizon on suppofed plane see fig xl plate iv having your horizontal line ruled proceed with fixing your point of sight as at and marking the place of your neareft pillar by dot at the summit or top as at and another at the bafe as at then rule line from to ard ano- ther from to and thefe two lines give the height of any number of villars for inftance would you have your pillar at fix your dor for the bafe then meet the diagonal at by ruling parallel line and to the diagonal rule the per- pendicular which perpendicular thews the height of the pillar required at or would you have pillar placed at obterve the foregoing directions ruling the parallels il and and the perpendiculars and will shew the required heights and diftances in finding the diameter at any particular diftances you are to be guided by that nearcit the bafe as for example fuppofe your neareft pillar to be ten feet in height and one in diamerer interfect from bottom to top in two equal parts and upon the bafe of the pillar fot off one of them from the point of sight to the din- meter then rule line to the point of sight from and you will have on the re- spective bafis the thicknets of each pillar the preceding rule exemplified in objects beneath the horizon see fig kii plate iv having ruled the horizontal line fix the point of sight as at then ac- cording to your judgment make dot for the feet of your figure as at and another for the head as at es then rule line from to and from to and thefe two diagonals will shew the true height of any number of figures that can be wanted make dots for the place of the feet of any figure where you would have them stand as at ii and now to know the height of each respectively draw parallel lines from the dots ii and to the diagonal then raife perpendiculars from the points where the parallels interfect this diagonal at mr ns and pu and the perpendicular thews the height of the figure at as does mr of that at ns of that at of that at and p of that at note you will be obliged always to fix the height of one figure as at de in or- der to find the size of the reft and the point of sight may be placed at any diftance you pleafe from the firft fuppofed figure on the horizontal line from line given to form square see fig kiii plate iv rule your bafe line of any length you pleafe as at then raife perpendicu- lars as in fig ii from to and from to next take with your compaffes the length from to and fetting one foot in turn the arch ef then with the same extent of compaffes fet one foot in and defcribe the arch laftly rule line from to touching the outward parts of the two arches where they interfect the perpendiculars and you have the square required from given line to form parallelogram see fig kiv plate iv rule given line of the length required as at then raife perpendicular at and another at as in fig ii and on them fet off the proper heights as and bd join dwith line and your parallelogram is complete fic xv plate iv in this figure we have attempted to thew how to draw with certainty that curved line which mr. hogarth in his ingenious analyfis has ftiled the line of beauty there has however been an objection raifed by some that he has omitted the rule whereby this truly afefid line may be found for which reafon and in order to enforce the study of it we have given this figure not as an infult upon that celebrated author whofe meaning is very clear but as line well deferving of attention being of itfelf fingle and eafily drawn and as we are defirous of following the method of that great artift in the explanation of our ideas by the moft familiar objects we here inform the student that it may be plainly feen in that well-known amulement of the school-boy fix-pointed star in which the contrafted halves of any two opposite points give the line which is with great propriety stiled the line of branty to execute direct view see fig plate if you would draw direct view of houfe and wall or in other words geome- trical elevation to be raifed from plan or ground-plot by scale made according to the dimenfions of the building firft rule the bafe line above the plan at any height you pleafe then erect perpendiculars at and for the extremities of the houfe alfo from the windows marked in the plan ef no which will give the breadth of all the windows rule thefe perpendiculars faintly with black lead having done this fuppose the bottom of the parlour or ground-floor win- dows to be feet above the bafe line take off with your compaffes feet from the scale and transter that meafure from to at each end of the houfe then fup- pofing the parlour windows to be feet high fer off that meafure from the scale and transfer ir to the extremities from to then if the diftance from the top of the parlour windows to the bottom of thofe on the firft floor be feet take ir as be- fore from the scale and fet it off at each end from to then fuppose the chamber windows to be feet high transfer that diftance from the scale from to at each end next supposing from the top of the firft floor or chamber windows to the bottom of the cornice to be feet take feet from the scale as before and fet off that diftance at each end from to then if the cornice be foot high meafure it off from the scale and transfer it to each end from to laftly fuppofe the roof to be feet from the top of the cornice fet off feet at each end from to then rule faintly with your pencil the parallels and you have the height and breadsh of all the windows cc which having ourlined rub out the parallels and perpendiculars with bread and fetting off feet the fup- pofed height of the wall rule the line from to at each end and the work is ready for shading to draw an oblique view see fig ii plate firft rule the horizontal line and if the moft remarkable objects be on the left-hland as at having taken your station on the bafe line as at from that place raife perpendicular which at the point of sight will inrerfect the hori- and to find the roof and bafe of the principal building rule the diagonalsl and me obferve whether the prospect before you make curve which if it should be careful to make the fame in your copy whether it be direct or oblique to draw view wherein are accidental points see fig iil plate suppofe large building in which are feen two fronts taking different directions as in this views fix your station at about the center of the bafe line after which rule the horizontal line then fix upon that your points of sight and es and rule firft the diagonals and and you may draw diagonals from the point of sight to and cc that they may take their proper directions towards their respective points of sight accidental points feldom intervene where there is but small diftance as in canals groves noblemehs ’ seats cc which are to be drawn by the stricleff rules of per- spective but when the prospect is extenfive it muft include every thing analagous thereto but as this requires fuch an infinite number of accidental points you had better not attempt them till your ideas are farther improved and your judgment more htrengthened of enlarging and contracting fig iv and plate wirff your compaffes divide your original into any number of squares and with your pencil rule from side to side and from top to bottom then divide your paper into the jame number of squares bigger or lets than the original you intend to enlarge or contract and you may to prevent wiltakes number the squares both in the original and copy as they are dene in the plate this done place your original before you and draw square by square that is to fay make the fame parts as are contained in one square of your original fall into the jame square of your intended copy and by doing this with care you will make the one exactly corre- spond with the other in due symmetry and proportion then outline your subject with indian ink and rub out the marks of the pencil with bread and fo preceed to thading of copying of draughts when you would copy print or drawing exactly of the jame size rub the back of it with the duft of red chalk or black lead lay this upon your paper and pin it down at the four corners then with blunt point trace the outlines and breadths of the shadows which done having carefully examined it to fee that nothing be omitted take it off and finith it with the pencil or pen another way to make an exact copy and at the tame time to preserve the ori- ginal is to lay piece of tranfparent paper upon it and draw the outlines thereon with black lead pencil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin poft-paper reddened or blackened at the back after which pro- ceed to trace and finish it according to the foregoing rule if you would reverfe your original you need only turn the tranparent paper with the drawing you have made upon it downwards upon the peft-paper and trace it as above directed of the imitation of life chiise the perfon you are to draw from to be of an handfome shape and good proportion as this will confirm your ideas and illuftrate the rules before-mentioned place the perfon in the moft natural and eafy pofition always avoiding in your early practice the copying of ungraceful or difforted attitudes which ferve only to give the young practitioner wrong bias and render him incapable of forming just and proper conception of the natural bcauries and graces of the human form begin as before directed with flight skerch with your charcoal of the main leading strokes or ourlines which having done correctly proceed to finith with your pencil take particular notice of the mufcles as they occur as this will give refemblance of the perfon in the outline if correctly obferved before you shadow it in drawing likeness great care is neceffary to express the paffions in the livelieit manner and this is done by minding the difpofition of every feature with peculiar nicety this being by far the moft difficult part the pupil has to learn we would advife him not to be too hafty to attain it before he has made thorough proficiency in the eafier and more practicable branches of drawing nor would we on the other hand difcourage the efforts of genius which in the purfuit of any art or science are noft certainly truly laudable and have been frequently attended with the deserved success all that we mean to inculcate by this caution is not to afpire all at once or by too hafty strides to perfection but rather to afcend progreffively the neceffary steps which lead towards it of hisory the student has in this branch the whole art of drawing as it were blended together and when he has fo far gained his point as to draw completely the human body this will be the moft delightful employment that can be imagined for the choice of subjects he need never be at loss as his own or his neighbours families will furnish him with abundance books will likewife greatly affift him particularly the sacred hiftory which is replece with an inexhauftible fund of events above all others worthy to be recorded and therefore moff deferving his ferious attention to this we may add the hiftory of our own country wherein the illuffrious actions of ancient heroes as well as thofe of our contemporaries and particularly our gallant officers military and naval in the laft war afford ample matter for the exercife of the ingenious artifl as to bealts birds flowers fruits plants cc we think it wholly unneceffary to give any directions concerning them as the subjects we have al- ready difcuffed are by far the moftufeful and he who can draw human figure correctly is fufficiently qualified for every other branch of this noble art but as the experienced draughtiman may fometimes choofe to vary the object of his study which when perfeet in anatomical subjects he may do with safety we have given few examples of beafts birds shipping for his farther entertainment and amufement observations on defign as well in regard to theory as practice the theory of defign is only to be acquired by fludying the beft authors who have laid down the fcientifical rules for the attainment of this art by found knowledge in the theory of defign thofe who are unable to draw the moft fimple ob- jects may be enabled to give their opinion upon the performances of the beft mafters in this cafe theory being detached from practice is equally confidered and diftinguish- ed by the epithet of tafte there is another method of acquiring taftes which is by frequently examining good pictures in the prefence of thofe who are efteemed con- noiffeurs in the art who generally pats their judgment without referve theory in this senfe of the word has been hitherto the greateft support of paint- ings for had tafte been confined to practice only we should not be able to find fo many invaluable pieces in the cabinets of princes and other encouragers of art and who could not perhaps have been permitted by their avocations to have acquired any tafte for this polite art to that painting of courfe would have found no patronage the practical part of defign is produced only by frequent application of the hand accompanied with the understanding in the imitation of various forms thofe objects whether perfons or places which we have but tranfient view of are in the memory like sketches of charcoal upon paper which the whilking of feather will entirely deface how then shall the unaccuftomed hand perform its func- tion when the object is not inculcated in the mind and can in short time retain only confuted idea of its refemblance this is therefore an infallible proof that the only way to attain perfection is to blend practice with theory from what has been already faid it is plain that the conveyance of the similitude of objects is only to be obtained by an unwearied application the hand by practice acquires facility which gives freedom and we muft correct that freedom by judg- ment pleafe to obferve that we do not here mean by judgment but exertion of the underftanding that is neceffary to compofe an hiftorical picture but relates only to proportion it being nothing uncommon for one who is good practical draughtf man to be entirely incapable of compofing which we think should be with the usmoft propriety afcribed to the genius
