certainly be reckoned among the qualifications which are the characteriftic of gentleman the study of it ought to be encouraged in every vouth whatever station of life he may be placed in for besides its great ufe to all perfons con— cerned in the way of art it muft be extremely agreeable to gentleman to sketch fine building beautiful prospect piece of art or uncommon appearance in nature befides drawing erables us to fee things in plainer and clearer manner and remember their form shape and other circumftances much better than can poffibly be dene without knowledge in this art in all ages it has been carefully cultivated by the moft- nations and the great men who have excelled in it have been homoured by the protection of thofe kings and prin— oes who had tafte for the liberal arts it fets before us the moft magnificent buildings the moft delightful gardens the beauties of art or the productions of nature in to ftrong and juft light that one might imagine one felf on the spot and this in language underftood by all mankind the implements for drawing are fmooth-grained charcoal black-lead pencils red black and white chalk port-crayon hair pencils crow-quill pens indian ink ruler and pair of compaffes.——charcoal is proper to lketch with as any strokes made with it may be brushed out with feather if wrong and the black lead pencil gives the correct out-line red chalk is proper to draw large or academy figures with and black chalk the fame especially on colour ’ paper where the lights put in with the art of drawing with white-chalk has beautiful effect.——it is beft to begin drawing from fome of the leaft complex examples as they are placed in this collection every thing should be drawn at firft with strokes juft vifible and afterwards corrected by altering what is amiss made as like the original as poffible in this manner learner should draw the feveral fearures in different pofitions well before he attempts an entire head or face for he can not do the whole together until he is mafter of the parts this done draw faces and heads from forme in outlines only ketch the out-line and finith from the same haded before in this particular will here give the moft approved proportions of face and head and the better to underfland it shall defcribe one viewed in front in which pofition it' outline makes nearly the shape of an egg divided by lines as in the examples the upper divifion for the hair then to the top and next to the bottom of the wose the lower one to the chin this laft part is fubdivided equally into three the uppermoft is the diftance between the nose and mouth the breadth is divided into five equal parts of which one is the eye another the diftance between the eyes from the outfide of the eye to the side of the face is another part the mouth is little more than one the nose little lefs the eye in front is divided into three one of which is the pupil or sight the ear is the length of the nofe one of the greateft beauties in drawing face and which is abfolutely neceffary to it is to place the features truly in their places that is the middle of the forebead the nofe and the moutb exactly under one another in line and the eyes on line properly croffing that on which the forchead nofe and mouth are placed if you would fee how thefe lines curve in the feveral attitudes the head may be put into there is very ingenious method in doing it by getting piece of box or other fmooth-grained wood turned in the shape of an egg make rraight line on this piece of wood from the middle of the top to the middle of the bottom then make cross strokes on it at the on the art of dr win proper diftances as before directed in peaking of the pro- portions of the head for the eyes nofe ec and by fetting this piece of wood in variety of different attitudes you will fee how the lines curve on thofe occafions and according to thofe curves you muft place and turn the feveral features by this means think you will eafily underftand this rule for placing the features properly which is one of the moft difficult points and at the fame time to abfolutely neceffary that it is impoftible to do any head well without it and next proceed to blands feer oc and for due proportions of which fee the examples after you draw thefe parts well and with eafe try an entire figure of which shall here give you the moft approved mea- fures and proportions.—the antients commonly allowed eigbt heads to their figures but we ordinarily divide the figures into ten faces from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot viz from the crown to the forehead one third of face the face begins at the root of the loweft hairs upon the forehead and ends at the bottom of the chin.——— the face is divided into three proportionable parts the firft contains the forehead the fecond the nofe and the third the mouth and the chin thence to the pitbetween the collar-bones two lengths of nofe to the bottom of the breafts one face to the naval one face to the genitories one face to the upper part of the knee two faces the knee contains half face to the ancle two faces to the sole of the foot half face man ’ arms ftretched out is from the longeft finger of his right hand to that of his left as broad as he is long from one side of the breafts to the other two faces the bone of the rm called humerus is two paces from shoulder to the elbow thence to the root of the little-finger the bone called cubitus with part of the hand contains two faces from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the col- lar-bones one face the sole of the foot is the sixth part of the figure the hland is the length of face the thumb nofe ec thofe meafures are general but liable to exceptions varying on the art of drawing from the quality of persons and movement of the miaf cles be careful to make juft symmetry and harmonious cor- in the whole figure not one leg of rm big ct or longer than the other not the fhrivelled face of old age with the plump lips of vouth the body of bacchus with the limbs of an apollo or the shoulders of an hercules with the waift of fribble it is proper here to take notice of hew great advantage to perfon who would draw human figure well it is to underftand fomething of the anaremy of it mean to much of it as relates to the bones and the mufcles and as appears externally more than this would be to him mere matter of curiofity but thus much is worth the pains of every one to become mafter of who is ambitious of know- ing the foundation of the art for it will be means of piv- ing grace strengib and bearuty to his figures and he wilk be able to exprets the proper parts of the limbs which prin- cipally operate in every action not blindly and by chance but with truth and certainty which is efteemed by every one who is beft able to judge one of the greateft beauties in figure there is proper work for this purpofe entitled compendious trearife of hnatomy adapted to the arts of painting and defign in which to much only as is neceffary to the painter with concife explanation of it is collected together from the more minnute parts which are neceffary to the surgeon or anatomifl in drapery cleath your figure properly and elegantly and neither with fome moderns by mafty folds lofe sight of your original intention nor by fervilely copying the ancients imi- tate wet linnen and it will be great help to proportion if whatever is intended for cloarbing be sketched naked of which preferve as much as poftible yet carefully avoiding the above extremes next in courfe tho firft in art is the expreftion of the feveral passions of the soul which is the moft difficult and beau- tiful parts of this art le brun who has treated this subject on the art of win with great fuccess fays that passon is motion of the soul which makes it follow what it thinks good and from that which it thinks hurtful and what caufes any paftion in the soul produces particular aetions in the body in the face it more particularly fhews what it feels which for that reafon is called the mirror of the soul the moft capital sub- jets extant of this kind are le bruns expressions of the passions of the soul where the principal paftions are beautifully exprefted by that great mafter in hleads almoft as large as the life with an abstract of his difcourfe on each of them thefe heads befides their fefulness in this particular are likewife some of the beft examples to draw after either in red or black chalk that are to be met with out-fine conquered our advice touching light and sbadow might almoft be pared fo shall only fay in the examples before you cover not the light too much at firft for that will throw gloom over your drawing and can not eafily be effaced on the contrary if your lights are too open you may advance on them with shade at pleafure in com- position to ditpose your objects that both light and shade may fall in mass and be careful that your principal be placed to advantage when you copy nature the nobleft school for art obferve the operation of ligbt which confidered and observ- ed from its fountain will alone instruct being unerring in its progrefs and rendering the beings moft confpicuous neareft to our view thus far relates to the human figure and it immediate ap- pendages which are the moft difficult and important subjects of this art thereare however other part which merit the re- gard of the learner the drawing flowers fruits birds beafts and the like might be the subject of fome of your firft attempts not only as it is more pleafing employment but as it is an eafier talk than the drawing of faces hands feet and other parts of the human body which require not only more care but greater exactnels and more judgment there are but the art of draw in but few particular rules for your instruction on this head you have variety of examples in this collection which copp with great care and exactness and be fure to make correct out-line before you begin to shade drawing of land/capes buildings cc for gentleman is the moft entertaining and wfeful in the whole art to be able on the spot as is before obferved to take the sketch of fine building or beautifiel prospect of any curious production of art or uncommen ap pearance in nature or whatever elfe may prefent itfelf to view on our journies or travels in our own or foreign countries may be thus brought home and preferved for our future ofe either in bufiness or converfation and is the beft method of bringing to mind again thofe beauties that have once charmed us trees or houfes though of the fame size will appear otherwife according to their nearness or diftance thofe at distance appearing less than thofe on the fore ground and thofe that are farther off yet less this propertion you muft be care- ful to repretent accordingly becaute it is that which principal ly gives the appearance of diftance and is one of the greateft beauties in view or landscape as may be feen by the ex- amples annexed and are beft inculcated by the appearance of objects according to their situation in nature the foregoing rules are neceffary to be known and will rear dily advance student therefore he who intends the imitative arts for his profeffion should well attend to them.—but the gentleman who means no further from his purfuit than an ac- complishment may be lets folicitous in the dicipline
