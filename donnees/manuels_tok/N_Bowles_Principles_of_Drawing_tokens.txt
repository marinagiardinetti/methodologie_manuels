bowles' principles of drawing forming complete drawing book illustrated with curious collection of examples beginning with an easy and simple method calculated to convey instruction to young minds by which they may acquire the art without the assistance of master every branch of drawing is contained in this book such as the different parts of the birds human body cattle academ shipplng dressed figures landscapes elegantly engraved on sixty folio pages of copper plates all from the original drawings of the most approved masters to which is prefixed an introduction to drawing containing rules and directions for the choice of instruments and materials and how to apply and manage them with easy and proper lessons for the young student translated from the french of monsieur gerard de lairesse with abstracts from du fresnoy the seventh edition corrected and greatly improved with additions london printed for and sold by the proprietor carington bowles at bis map and print warehouse no in st. paul church yard drawing is the art of representing by lines and shades the figure of any object we see or of any form we conceive an idea of in the mind it is most ingenious useful and elegant art and the study of it ought to be encouraged in every youth that discovers an inclination or genius towards the practice thereof whatever station of life he may be placed in its utility is so very exten- sive there are few arts and few professions in which it is not serviceable all designs and models are executed by it ma- thematicians engineers architects mariners gardiners em- broiderers weavers and multitude of other professions have frequent occasion to practise it in most stations it is useful from the general who commands an army to the mechanic who supports himself by handicraft person who has knowledge in drawing and capacity of performing it usually sees and remembers the form shape and other circumstances of objects more minutely and perfect than one unacquainted with the art and possesses an accom- plissiment exceedingly desirable both for amusement and use he is qualified to take on the spot the sketch of fine building of beautiful prospect of any curious production of art or of uncommon and striking appearances in nature and to bring home for future inspection and service the foris of objects which yreld entertainment in journies and distant places whether you draw after nature or the perform- ances of others the hand can only express by lines and shades those forms and ideas which have impressed the mind hence the utility appears of accustoming the mind to curious and attentive observation of objects especially of those intended for imitation its imprefsions will hereby be strengthened its conceptions will be more exact and just and the hand will delineate with greater ease and correctness those forms which are clearly and strongly retained in the memory inform your judgment of the properties and excellencies of à drawing well executed in this knowledge the mind wil make quick improvement by frequent attentive inspection of the performances of those who have excelled in viewing them contemplate the freedom and boldness of the outline the correctness or justness of the proportion of the several parts the character which is peculiar and distinguishing in every figure and expressive of the circumstances it is supposed to be in the elegance or that which gives à kind of delicacy or certain agreeableness which pleases every one the perspec- tive or representation of the parts according to their situation with respect to the point of sight if the judgment be well in- formed in these particulars the young practitioner will make much greater improvement than can possibly be attained if he proceeds in practice without due regard to increasing know¬ ledge and judgment more to the genius than the hand we owe from this the beauties of your art must flow the labour of the hand must second and support that of the brain to become an able artist the art must be made habi- tual an easy and just expreffion is only to be gained by con- stant practice in all aris the rules are learned in little time but the practice requires long and severe diiigence the hand should be improved in practice and the mind in judgment every day this ingenious art not only affords very pleasing entertain- ment to men of leisure and fortune in variety of instances but enables them to judge the propriety of designs for such works as they intend to have executed to lay down and ex- hibit their construction and vary and improve the plan most to their own liking of all others this art has the greatest number of admirers and no wonder since in kind of universal language under- stood by all men it represents to our vicw the forms of innu- merable objects we have no other ways of beholding and helps us to the knowledge of many of the works in nature or art which any other method of describing would be insuffi- cient to give an idea of- it transmits to our view things long since past and preserves the forms of others that will soon perisni it reprefents the deeds of people and actions for many ages dead and hands down to us the features and resem- blances of our ancestors and of other valuable and renowned persous of former generations the esteem of this excellent art is not confined to adults children admire it and often by the power of natural genius draw variety of objects ili such manner as to excite commendation for the instruction of vouth in this useful art the following rules are laid down and course of proper lessons exhibited for their practice to be observed let your first practice be employed in imitating the most plain and simple objects in accustoming your hand to draw strait lines perpendicular and horizontal ones circular and irregularly curved lines this method will be useful in bring- ing the hand to facility of operation moreover these lines are the rudiments of all objects that can be expressed they bound and circumscribe every figure all its parts or mem- bers are composed of them little time may be advantage- ously employed in drawing after plain inanimate figures which require strokes of various curvings after this draw the par- ticular seatures of the face beginning with the eye the nofe the mouth the ears draw them in their different positions persevere in copying several times after the same example be- fore vou make the transition to new one you cannôt expect to draw an entire head or face till you are capable of perform- ing the parts separatelv nor of copying with pleasure and improvement those objects which require more art and time till you have acquired customary exercise of patience and freedom and exactness in copying those that are easier sketch vour outline at first very faint that the amendment of it may be performed without its appearing to be re-touch- ed endeavour at à graceful freedom boldness and just pro- portion of all its parts in these the exceliency of good out- line consists it should be drawn with flowing and gliding strokes not swelling suddenly but with gradual risings such as might just be felt in statues be careful that it loses nothing of its freedom and boldness when you correct it by reducing some purts and swelling others the outiine on that side nearest the light must be fainter than the other the surest and most im- proving miethod of practice is to fketch outlines for consi¬ derable time without attempting to shade any of them and to make numbers of sketches from the same pattern imitating as nearly as you ean every stroke and carefully to compare each of vour copies with the original that vou may observe wherein it is faiilty and avoid those ercors in vour next sketch good outline is of the greatest importance and extent in the art of drawing drawing an ability to make it can only be acquired by appli¬ cation and practice proceed slowlv in vour first attempts making it vour care to secure every stroke and rather to produce one good sketch than in heedless manner to hurry over number of bad ones view your original with close attention ponder upon the length the breadth and the form of each part their propor- tions to one another and to the whole the distance from one part to fhe other which of them lie parallel and which un- derneath the other in considering what parts are opposite to each other you may conceive or occasionally draw perpen- dicular line from the top to the bottom and à strait line from side to sitle and notice what parts are marked by these lines and in what manner others deviate from them this obser- vation may be made by laying vour ruler acrofs the work and observing the parts intersected thereby sketch out the general appearance of the whole in very faint strokes without regarding the minute particulars and littie turns these may be added afterwards review your sketch after it has been laid aside for some time comparing it again with the original faults may then appear which were indiscovered before this method of practice tends to make you more perfect in any particular sketch and by improving your knowledge of outlines and proportions to enable you for nearer imitation after other patterns proportion or the just magnitude of the several members makes one essential article in every good draught scheme of the proportions of graceful human figure is given in the fifth lesson taken from the measures of antique statues estcemed for the highest degrees of proportion knowledge of these will be of great service to the young student yet it must not be supposed that this scheme is the standard of measurement for all figures for different attitudes make sensible difference in the limbs of the same bodv the muscles shift their appearances swell- this the arm the foot the knee are enlarged by bend¬ ing them and the limbs are also fore shortened moreover different human bodies of agreeable appear- ances have nat the same meafures and exact propoitions in their features and limbs therefore the eye must judge of gracefulness and proportion fitnefs to peculiar characters should always be joined to the idea of proportion brawny muscular limbs are expressive of strength and more stender forms of agility for motion the legs of chairmen and the shoulders of watermen are enlarged by tleir different occupations aukward as such fioure ap- pears yet thoughtiess country clown is fitly expressed by large liead shoyt neck high shoulders flat stomach thick knees and thighs and large feet proportion in these and other instances are regulated by fitnefs to peculiar characters and no exact dimensions can be given of them the proper materials for drawing he materials for drawing are black lead pencils charcoal crayons 'of black white or red chalk or other dry co- lours madle up into crayons portcrayon indian ink hair pencils crow-quill pens à rulerand pair of compasses black lead pencil is most convenient at the beginning of practice slope your pencil to fine point accustom yourself to hold it further from the point than the nib of pen in writ- ing this is necessary to an easy command of hand and to the making your strokes with freedom and holduenrs charcoal of fine smooth grain slit into slender pieces fon the portcrayon is very proper for sketching as any strokes made with it are easisy brushied out with feather or clean soft rag if you thiuk them wrong having secured your outline with charcoal wipe it slightly over with feather to make the lines fajnt then go over them with black or red lead endea- vouring to make them more correct these new strokes when wrong may be discharged with india rubber or the crumbs of stale white bread in sketching after plaster or academy figures charcoal is much used because it is easily discharged chalk the best sort of it is free from grittinefs and sand is pretty foft and has kind of fatness in it black chalk is often used on blue or grey paper the colour of which serves for good part of the shading and the lighis are put in with white chalk red chalk is used on white paper the shades made in hatching with it receive sostness by rubbing them in gently in the broad strong parts with stump made of wasfi leather and then hatching upon them again chalk is proper for drawing large figures but little experience will teach you to be careful not to make false strokes with it for they are very difficult to be discharged from the paper crayons are any colours mixed with tobacco-pipe clayy which while soft and in the consistency of paste is rolled up in pieces about the thicknefs of quill and two or three inches in length and then being dried are properly called dry co- lours they work easiest and express themselves strongest on paper of rough grain and are used on coloured paper if dark or brownissi or near the colour of whited-brown paper it yields good relief to the tender parts of the work in ufing these colours they are rubbed and wrought one into another in such manner that no strokes appear but the colours are mixed as if they were laid in with brushi many pictures after the life are painted in crayons drawing with these dry colours is quick and expeditious and when the crayons are handled with judgment they give delicate softness but the touch of rude finger may spoil the sine work or damp place mildew it indian ink does not spread and run like common ink and the work performed with it-appears much softer it is bought in small cakes and by mixing it with water may be made to any degree of strength and used either with hair pencil or in pen like common ink when the young student has made some progress in drawing with his black lead pencil and be- gins to use this ink let him secure his outline as correct as he can with the black lead then he may trace it over with pen or hair pencil and indian ink and afterwards with india rub- ber er the crumb of stale white bread rub out any remaining marks of the black lead pencil shading with this ink is sometimes done by hasching with the pen or making strokes crossing one anorher but this is as well or better performed with the hair pencil more expe- ditious and customary manner is washing or working the shades with the ink and hair peneils in the sanie way as water colours are used the shades made by hatching resemble the siroke of engraved prints in wasliing the shades they appear like those in mezzotinto prints in which there is not any lines the ruler and compasses are useful in making geometrical figures and in architecture excepting in these instances the ruler is never to be used and the compasses but seldom oc- casionally they may be applied in nicely examining the agree- ment of the copy with the original but it is best to judge in most caïes by the eye only the conduct of the teints of lights and shadows it is the proper distribution of light and shade which gives the appearance of substanice round or flat sliapes distance and relievo or projection to whatever bodies you represent draw circle and according to the manner in which you shade it it will either receive flat globular or concave appearance fill it up with an even colour or with number of lines of thie same strength and it will resemble body with round circumference and flat sides by colouring it strongest in the middle the edges are made to retire by the gradating shiades and it receives convex appearance like globe by graduaily weakening the stiades from the edge towards the centre the middle part will be made to retire and concave appearance like bason be given to it those parts of an object which have the greatest vivacity of colour catch the sight first and appear nearest to it by gradually weakening thé colour the other parts are made to recede from the eye and appear farther off pure and unmixed white either brings an object nearer or makes it to retire further if the white be gradual ly weak- ened and supported by fhade it then advances but unless it be thus forced forward it slies off to the remotest view in rounding the parts of any object thelight and thade must be gradually softened into oné another and lose themselves by slow and almost imperceptible degrees the outline must be faiait in those parts which receive the light and strong and bold where the shades fall begin vour shading at the top proceed downward and go through the whole of it with faint shade before you give the finishiag to any particular part abalance should be preserved between the lights and shades they serve for an opposition to onc another broad light must therefore be accompanied with broad shade fainter light with fainter shade light objects must have sufficient strength of shadow to sustain them and dark bodies must be relieved by mafs of light behind without this opposition objects will adhere to the ground or stick to one another but by distributing lights and shadows to advantage they are loosened and set free and receive strong relievo those objects or parts of objects which come forwardest to view must have strong and smart oppositions and the highest finishing those that are designed to be thrown further off must be made still weaker and less distinct in nature objects appear distinct or confused according to their nearness or dis- tance the features of face or folds of garment are not distinguishable the length of street and the innumerable leaves of distant plantation look like one confused mafs more accurate or slighter finissiing gives to oljects relative dominion over each other as to their distances the heightening of one chases another further from the sight which is not so minutely and strongly penciled give to every object such lights as are most proper to its supposed situation in the open air when the sun shines full upon objects the lights must be strong and bold and the sha¬ dows dark if the sun is obscured by clouds the light is more equal and universal but not so strong and warm and the shiades must be fainter and more sweet artificial light tinges the object with its own colour and occasions large shadows with bold extremities elementary light is pure and more generally diffused and the shadows it produces are softer the projecting parts of objects that are nearest to the light catch it first are brightest and produce shiades upon the lower parts consider trom what poinf and in what di- in all arts and sciences the learner begins with the most simple principles the knowledge of the alphabet is an intro- duction to the grammar aud an ability to imitate the forms of different lines it is no matter of what shape so that they are cxactly imitated is the foundation of drawing aster every kind of object in the first lesson the scholar is presented with many lines of different kinds for his imitation viz perpendicular lines marked that is line falling directly on another so as to rection the light salls upon the object and place all your lights and shades according to that direction if it falls perpendicu- lar upon man the top of the head is then lightest the shoulders in the next degree so and the lower part gradually darker the cavities and parts that bend inwards not receiv- itg any direct rays are darkest of all and the colours are lost in them the full force of the principal light is to be only in one part and ought not to be crossed or interrupted with littie shadows sudden brightness is seen and many reflections and small tints are produced when the force of light strikes upon siiks sattins vessels of silver copper or upon other glit- tering objects the very extremitv of the shadowed side of objects is sel- dom the darkest of all because it almost always receives à re- flection of light from adjacent bodies reslexes are scarce sensible except in the shadowed parts all reflected light is supposed to carry withit part of the colour of the body which reflects it so that those places which receive this light have their own colour mixed or tinged with the other much skill and accuracy is often required in management of the reflexes as the same place many times receives them from different ob- jects differently coloured every circumstance of the colour light and position of each figure and what effect each has upon the other is to be considered and nature pursued in all the variety of mixtures nature gives vast variety of appearances in light and shade 'curious observer of them is rewarded with high delight and the artist with much improvement the sky always gradates one way or another the rising and setting sun exhibit it with astonishing beasty and perfection the variety of forms and colours reflected in water from the sky and clouds from trees houses and other objects are exceeding beautiful to behold accustom yourself to consider the different effects of light falling upon objects its various and delightful softnings and modulations in the shades or parts which are more or less deprived of the rays your judgment will this way be best in- formed by your senses how to represent these pleasing appear- ances the proper ianagenient of which makes onc of thé great divisions or branches of painting first lesson make equal angles on each side horizontal lines which pass srom onc point to another without any deviation ob- lique lines converging or approximating one way and diverg- ing or continually increasing their distance the other way parallel lines which are every where equidistant from each other at two semicircles are drawn from points assumed in the lower line and the upper line being tangent to both of them proves the truth of its being drawn parallel ex- amples are also given of various sorts of curved and twining lines the second lesson consists partly of geometrical figures some of them with plain lines others with their surfaces formed by light and shade number is cijcle the circle appearing with flat side being filled with an equal shade convex ap- pearance given to the circle by light and shade con- cave appearance given to it other convex and concave surfaces square of four equal sides an equilateral the third leslon will be more pleasing to the learner than the former ones and practising after the instances the following leaves exhibit many examples of the fea- tures of the human face as the eyes nose mouth ears the pupil should practise after the different features in their various positions till he is able to draw them well unless he can perfoim the parts separately it will be fruitless to attempt the whole together triangle spiral or curve line issuing from centre and continually going off fromit at every turn cone these with other figures shewn in this lesson are useful in different parts of practice by consulting small treatise of practical geometry by le clerc the student in fhiort time will gain knowledge of the construction of geometrical figures very advantageous in drawing multitudes of objects here given will qualify him to copy more difficult representations several easy examples are also given of entire faces and heads in variots aftitudes when the student has made progress in sketching after those in outline there are others which are finisnied for him to shade after by considering the plate annexed he will improve his ideas of face and the method of drawing it in all the changes and variations which are occasioned therein by different turnings of the head the divisions and proportions of the head and face in drawing head and face four equal parts the length of the nose are usually allotted from the top to the bottoi froi the crown of the head to the top of the forehead from thence to the top of the nofe to the bottom of the nofe from thence to the bottom of the chin the breadth of the face is divided into five equal parts one of which parts is the length of the eye the distance between the eyes is the measure of one part and from the corner of the eye to the side of the face is one part the width of the mouth is little more than one of these parts the width of the nose across the nostrils little less thie eve is divided into three parts one of which is the measure of the pupil or sight with the iris round it the ear is usually the length of the nose these are approved proportions of good face viewed in front but in different beautiful subjects the same features often vary both in length and shape the head in general has nearly the shape of an egg or oval as in fig of the annexed plate in the middle of the oval draw from the top to the bottom perpendicu- the features of front face when drawn upon the cross lines according to these directions will ap- pear in their proper places whatever way the oval or egg is turned as is shewn in fig and the learner may ap- prehend more perfectly the ule of these two lines their variations in the different turnings of the head and how the features on them appear when the face is in- clining to either side turn- ing upwards or dotn wards let him either conceive of or procure piece of smooti wooe turned in the form of an draw line length- ways quite round the egg as in sig and -rpendicu- lar from top to bottom as in fig divide this line into two equal parts by another which reaches from side to side as in fig the fea- tures being drawn on these cross lines produce front right face as in fig by turning the egg small mat¬ ter to the left or to the right the crofs lines appear more curved as in fig and the features must be drawn on them as shiewn in fig and the nose always projects beyond the perpendicular line in pro- portion as the face is more or less turned aside and more of the ear and nearest side of the face becomes vi- sible the first line which was drawn round the eg no longer its boundary but it gains à new circum- ierent line by being turned into new position by in- ciining the egg downwards and little to the left the cross will appear as in fig raised upwards and re- clining to the right the lines appear as in fig and the features in these instances are shewn in sig and vast variety of faces differently inclined may be shiewn by this oval or egg lar line as in fig through the centre of this line draw another directly across as in fig on these two lines the features of the face are to be drawn in their due proportions divide the perpendicular line into four equal parts the first must be allotted to the hair of the head the second is from the top of the forehead to the top of the nose the third reaches to the bottom of the nose the fourth division includies the lips and chin this perpendicular line divides the face breadth-ways into two equal parts it lies exactly in the middle betwixt the eyes runs down the midst of the nose and the gutter underneath the middle of the mouth must always be placed on it and the bottom of it terminates on the point of the chin divide the cross line which is the breadth of the face into five equal parts and place the eyes upon it so as to leave exactly the lergth of one eye between them this is to be understood of front face as in fig for if it turns to either side the distance appears lessened on that side which is farthest from you the cross line is the boundary for the top of the ears the bottom of them is parallel with the bottom of the nose the nostrils should not swell beyond the inner corner of the eye profiles or side faces are to be drawn by means of per- pendicular as in fig on which the forehead nofe mouth and chin are to be placed as in fig in these figures the line from top to bottom is strictly perpendicular it would be so in an oval drawn on paper or any flat surface but the curvity of an egg turns it out of that form though for dis¬ tinction sake it is described by that name in the foregoing accouint yhen vou mark the features in their proper places touch them very lightlvat sirst and afterwards proceed on them with greater exactness then draw the hair beard and ’ shadows when the pupil can draw face and head tolerably well he may proceed upon the hands and seet the hands are very important articles and to perform them with ease and freedom is not à little difficult much labour should be be- stowed in practising aster the examples given of them in their various actions and foreshortnings the hand from the tip of the fore-singer to the wrist is the length of face that is threc quarters of head and this length is equally divided into two parts one of which is for the pali of the hand the thumb is the length of the nose the breadth of the palm is the same as its length equal to the length of the fore finger the nail of the finger is about half the joint it stands upon the soot vicwed sideways is in length the sixth part of tlie figure and may be divided into four equal parts one of which is for the heel two others for the sole and the other for the toes the great toe is commonly the length of the thumb these proportions usually obtain and it will be useful for the pupil to fix an idea of them in his mind though there be few opportunities of applying them directly because of the foreshortnings in which these parts appear in almost every graceful action he ancients commonly allowed eigat heads to their figures the moderns ordinarily divide the figure into ten faces the face beginning at the root of the lowest hairs on the forehead and ending at tne bettom of the chin an human sigure divided according to this method into ten equal parts of the length of face each division will reach as followys the first from the crown of-the head to the nostrils the second tothe hole in the neck between the collar-bones the third to the pit of the stomach the fourth to the navel the sisth to the lower part of the belly the sixth and seventh to the upper part of the knce the thigh being the length of two faces the kuce contains half face from the lower part of the knee to the ankle two faces from tlic ankie to the sole of the foot haif face man with his arms extended from the extremity of the longest singer of his right hand to the longest of his left mea- sures as broad as he is-long viz from the tip of tie long singer to the joint of the wrist one face thence to the elbow one sace and one third begin with making the oval for the head and divide it according to the instructions already given agreeable to tiat uiversal rule in all just designs of comparing and pro- portioning every part to the first the rest of your figure must now be proportioned to the head theresore draw perpen- dicular srom the top of the oval and mark on it eight divisions or lengths of the head sor the heighth of the figure and adjust- ment of its parts this line is also of use in placing the figure upright and whether it be measurede by eight heads or ten saces the sormer leston directs what parts of the body are to be placed on the several divisions skeich the head sirst then the shoulders then draw the runk of the body beginning with the arm-pits ioaving the aviie tiil afterwar-ie and sy doin to the hips on boch sides bout it in all faces there are some principal touches which ive spirit and are the characteristic thereof these should be well considered and caresully expressed if the face be fat the cheeks will seem to swell if lean the jaw bones will stick out and cheeks fall in the corners of the mouth and middle of the eye-brows will be elevated in agreeable sensations the eye-brows will rise up at tlie ends and fall in the mid¬ dle and the corner of the mouth will sink in pain or unea- siness the mouth by fhooting forwards and rising in the middle expresses aversion every passion of the soul is visible in the features of the face the lines and lights which are ex¬ pressed of them proclaim particular attention thence to the juncture of the shoulder one face and one third thence to the hole of the neck one face and one third in all five faces which with the five along the other arm to the tip of the middle finger gives ten in measuring figure by eight parts each part the length of the head the divisions allotted to them are vix from the crown of the head to the point of the chin one thence to the bottom of the breasts one thence to the navel one thence to the lower part of the belly one thence to the mid- dle of the tligh one thence to the lower part of the knee one thence to the small of the leg one thence to the bottom of the foot one the figure with his arms stretched out measured breadth- ways by eight parts or heads is divided as follows viz from the end of the long finger to the wrist one thence to the bend of the arm one thence to the bottom of the shoulder one thence over to the other shoulder two thence to the end of the other long finger three the proportions of man differ in some respects from those of woman particularly the head of woman is lessthan that of man and her neck longer the breasts and belly are lower the space from the bottom of the breast to the navel is half the length of the nose less than in men aad the thigh third part of the nose shorter as to the breadth wogfian has her breasts and shoulders narrower and her haunches larger her thighs at the place of articulation are larger the tops of their arms and legs are larger than man ’ but down¬ wards more slender and their hands and feet are less new born infant is not at most above sour lieads long and seldom so much at sour orfive years old it is about five heads long and the length of the body increases with its age till it arrives fo tie state of manhood and attains its ful proportions the thicknefs of the limbs must be adjusted agreeable to the qualitv and character of the figure in general it may be noticed that the breadth of the thigh at tliè thickest is double that of the thickest part of the leg and treble that of the smallest but there is à difference in tlie contours of paris when put in different postures thus when the arm is bent it is larger than when straight the same is true of the foot and kuee and other limbs and joints baing careful to observe the breadth of the waist then draw that leg which the body rests upon and asterwards the other which stands loose next draw the arms and last of all the hands.. it is somctimes recommended to begin the sketch on the right side of the figure that in the proeess of the work the performer ’ hand may nehiter hide or shade any part of it as it may happen in some draughts when begun on the left side to ensorce direction already given in the general rules carefully view the original you draw after the distance of one feature limb joint mulcle fromt another their length breadth and turnings their proportion to cach other and to the whole figure which of thei are directy unaer the other which of them are parallel and how they stand situated with regard to any part of the figure preserve just symmetry and harmonious correspondence in all the parts of the figure by forming them in due propor¬ tions to one another not one arm bigger or longer than the other or of size ill adapted to any of the other parts not plump and strong limbs with shrivelled face or decayed body or broad herculean shoulders with the wasted limbs of fribble take notice of the bowings and bendings of the body and contrast the opposite parts answerable thereto if the belly bends in the body must stick out if the knee bends in drawing naked body whatever muscles appear must be expressed agreeable to the rules of anatomy they must not be subdivided into small sections but kept as entire as possi- ble only the principal muscles and those which are of signi¬ fication to express that action which is represented should be the motion or action of the figure must made to appear always be considered in drawing the muscles for they rise and sink and are either less or more apparent according to the different motions of th- body the muscles of the leg which supports the body or of an arm that lifts weight are fuller or more swelled than in the leg or arm wllich are not an cloathing vour figure or casting the drapery over them with elegance and propriety it shiould be considered that the beauty of draperies consist not in the multitude of folds but in their natural order and plain simplicity the drapery must encompass the parts loosely when it sits too strait or close it gives stiffnefs to the figure and seems obstructive to its motions draw the plaits large and foliowing the form of the limbs underneath that they may be distinguished srom others by due management of the light and shades the extremities of the joints as the fhoulders elbows knees should be so marked as to be apparent as far as art and probability will permit notwithstanding they are covered this is so material consideration that many artists first sketch the naked figure aud afterwards put the drapery on it the great folds must be drawn first and asterwards broke and divided ints lesser ones and great care be taken that they do nut cross one another improperly though in general rhe folds should be large and as few as possible vet thev must be greater or less according to the quality of the stuff of which the draperv is supposed to consist some as coarse woollens make their folds abrupt and harshi and others as silks and sine linens more soft and easy the surface of some has à lustre others are dull some aré pliable and transpa¬ rent others strong and solid the quality of the person is likewise to be considered in the drapery if they are magi- strates or dignisied personages their robes or dvaperies should be large and ampie if ladies and nymphs thin sost and pliable if counsy clowns ordinary people or slaves they out the ham must fall in and so of every other joint in the body sketch vour outline at sirst very faint marking the general appearance and proportion of the most conspicuous and remarkable particulars with slight touches and afterwards introduce the minute parts by tracing it over again correcting the first sketch by little and litile until the whole contour be finished with admirable exactness steady even light is al- ways to be chosen that no glare may come on the original or on your own work so employed those of the breast become more or less visibie lifting up or holding down the arm in drawing young persons the muscles must not ap- pear so manifestly as in those who are elder and full grown the same is to be observed in fat and flesliy peôple and in such as are very delicate and beautiful in women and children scarce any muscles at all are to be ex- pressed and but faintly when swelled by forcible action in persons of an hardy and robust make they are most apparent ought to be stout and coarse suit the garment and folds to the posture of the body and the sway or action of the limbs crooked or strait or bending one way or another ac- cording to their various positions in such manner as will best express their attitude and motion different postures and motions vary the solds and bring them into new forms and whatever posture the body is supposed to be in should be ex- pressed by an artful complication of them when they are well imagined they give much spirit to every action great likeness and motion of the drapery are ouly proper for figures in great agitation or exposed to the wind the loose apparel in this case must all sly one way and that part of the garment which adheres closest to the body should be drawn before the loose part which flies from it in order to secure the true position of the figure the closer the garment sits to the body the narrower and sinaller must be the folds the draperies which cover those parts that are exposed to great light mnust not be so deeply shaded as to seem to pierce them nor should the limbs in that situation of light be crossed by solds that are too strong lest the great darkness of the snade give them the appearance of being broke whenever the drapery is adorned with rich ornaments they should be intro¬ duced with judgment and propriety suitable to the character of the sigure and in general be used sparingly it is altoge- ther improper and debasing to use them in the imaginary re- presentation of angels the dignity and grandeur of whose dra¬ peries ought rather to consist in noble flow of the folds than in rich stuff and the glitter of ornaments always choose north light if possible because it is stcady and most equally diffused darken with the slutters all the windows of the room but one and darken the lower part of thât window the light contracted in this manner and only admitted at an altitude above the position of the figure will make the snadows distinct and snew every part of it to advantage if vou are constrained to window which has south aspect transparent sasni of oil ’ paper will mo¬ derate the light and take off the glare sit at distance from the model in proportion to its size so far that vou may sce the whole of it at onice which may be effected at à distance about twice or three times its magni- tude seat yourself in such manner as to bring vour eye upon à level with the sigare place vour picture in good light by which is meant not only an even steady light as directed in the former arti- cle but also the proper light for the picture that it may fall thereon cither on the right or left side agreeable to the lights and shadows in the painting seat yourself at proper dis- tance fromn it to see the whole picture at once observe nicely what object is placed in the middle of the picture mark slightly the middle of vour paper and give it the same situation observe the principal olyjects on the left and on the right side how they are placed and ranged sketch their rough form very slightly in the same disposition and proportion till all the principal parts are marked on your paper in their proper places the expression or supposed character and circumstances of every object in the picture must be well studied and imprinted on your mind its atti- tude posture and gesture preserved in your copy and those parts be particularly noticed by which the action and senti- ment are represented in strong and lively manner as the whole composition thould be slightly sketched before you begin to sinish any part for the snading vou should oo on with the whole together with faint shade before you finish any part mauy directions are given in the preceding essay for thie lights and shades common method of adjusting the distances the situation and proportion of every object agrecable to the picture is to divide it into little squares and then to divide the paper foi having fixed vour station and deteriined what ex- tent of view to delineate draw the horizontal line faintly aud mark it into three divisions then divide in vour mind the landscape in three divisions likewise sketch the middle divi¬ sion first then that on the left hand afterwards tiat on the right observe what objects fall under one another and mark them on your paper accordingly what objecte range on level with each other between the two sides and place them parallel in your draugnt remnark what ohjects are the observations heretofore laid down are applicable ti this branch of drawing to urge the most material of them copy after good originals mark out all the pars before you begin to shadow make the contours in great pieces without taking notice of the little muscles and other breaks observe every stroke as to its perpendicular pa¬ rallel and distance and particularly so to compare and op- pose the parts that meet upon and traverse the perpendicu- lar as to form kind of square in the mind which is the great and almost the only rule for producing just and exact copy.. carefully regard not only the model vou are copy- ing after but also the parts vou have already drawn therei being no possibility of perserving strict justness in vour per- formance but by comparing and proportioning every part to the first the copy into the same number of squares and to draw ini them what is correspondent to each square this is sure- method to enlarge or reduce draught with exactness but ifj the student accustom hiinself to practise by the help of these squares he will certainly stint and confine his judgmenti let him rather help it by imaginary lines than cramp it by real ones let him conceive in his mind perpendicular and an horizontal line intersecting each other in the middle of thej picture and observe what objects are crossed by them and then suppose two such lines crossing his paper in order to give those objects similar situation in like manner the si- tuation and proportion of all the chief parts throughout the picture may be considered by imagining other lines traversing them and dividing as it were the several parts of the paintingi into small squares the primary qualification in the art off- drawing is readiness of comparing and measuring by the eye all the parts of composition and an ability to exprefs them with boldness and justness.. this essential accomplissi- ment is to be acquired by habit and application the proportion form and magnitude of olyjects their di- munition in size and lustre are governed by the rules of per- spective knowledge in the practical part of that sciencen will greatly advance tlie pupil ’ judgment and facilitate his practice and this knowledge may be attained with surpriz- ing ease by consulting that plain and familiar treatise thei jcsuit ’ perspective translated by ephraim chambers seen through the intervals of other particular objects and give them the same apparent situation endieavour to sketch all the objects in their proporyional magnitudes and distances they gradually diminisn as they are farther removed from thei eye and it is this dimunition with gradual softenings and in- distinctness which gives distant objects their remote appeark ance there are certain infallible rules in perspective for the management of this important article make all you lights and shades
