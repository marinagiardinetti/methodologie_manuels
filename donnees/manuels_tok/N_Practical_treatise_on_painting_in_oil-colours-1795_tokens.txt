thus reduced into vapours catily attaches itfelf to the furface of thefe plates penetrates them and is impreg- lated with this metal which it reduces to beautiful white powder called cernss when this powder is ground and fitted for painting it is termed white lead.— flake-white and nottingham-white are alfo preparations of lead and are nearly the felf fame thing through the com- munication of philofophical gentleman of veracity the writer of this is enabled to hate—that the principal difference be- tween the procets of making obite lead and nottingsam-white confitts in the ufe of alegar inttead of vinegar from very fevere trial he made of both the white colours the preference is decidedly in favour of nottingham-white— he painted wii the back-board of picture frame one half with common obite lead the other half with nottingbam-white the picture in its frame was hung up as ufual and was not difturbed for feveral months at the end of which time the picture was removed and the fide painted with notting- ham-wbite wasnearly as whiteas ever while the other half was changed to deep yel- low.—if conjecture may be offered on the superior efficacy of alegar over vinegar in the preparation of white colour from lead it is—that alegar contains more of vinows acid than common vinegar for independent of the greater quantity of faccharine matter which enters into it poffeffes the virtue and spirit of the bop peculiarity unknown to the common vinegar that vinous acid is fuperior to any other is well known as the verdigrife made at mont- pellier e and grenoble from vine-ftalks

again faturated which will be known by the difcontinuance of the bubbles more acid of vitriol is to be dropped in and white precipitate is again thrown down if any of the litharge remains undiffolved the nitrous acid being fet at liberty fe- cond time attacks it as at firft and by continuing to add acid of vitriol the whole of the litharge may be converted into moft beautiful and durable white infortunately this colour can not be ufed in ofl though in water it feems fuperior t any if the process be well managed an ounce of nitrous acid may be made to convert feveral pounds of litharge into white of this kind ir has been firongly recommended to paper-ftarners and others who ufe water- colours in large quantities to prepare their lakes and the colours now prepared of chalk on the bafis of the above precipi- tate of lead.—for inftance if the colour required be very fine one suppofe from cochineal the colouring matter is to be firtt extracted by fpirst of wins without heat when the

be poured on rubbing the mix= ture conftantly and thus by proper ma ragement wv ii many beautiful colours not in- ferior to the beft carmine may be pres pared.—when only fnall quantity of colour for the more exquitite touches of the miniature painter is required we would recommend the process to be con- ducted on the bafis of robite precipitate or calx of tin purfuing the same method of rubbing in the colouring tincture as when white precipitate of lead is uted if inftead of cochineal brazil-wood tur- meric logwood exc be fubftituted dif- ferent kinds of red yellow and purple may be

fhade- tint here we may obferve that the shade and light-red tints are fo friendly and delicate in their natures that they will not dirty though we are continually changing them how proper then and agreeable to our purpofe are they for making the moft principal part of the like- nets when in altering and changing they always produce clean colour of the in¬ yiting pearly hue the second part of the first paintinc in order to finith the firft painting im= prove tracticaerules for prove the reds and yellows to the com= plexion and after them the blues obferv- ing that the blues on the reds make the purple and on the yellows produce the green the same method is to be under- food of the shadows but be fure to leave them clean and not too dark therefore allowance should be made in their

always in the fame order for finithing though the colour of the cloth be quite the reverfe i in.oil colours is proved by experience that the grounds of shadows in what we call the dead-colouring should be fuch as will tupport the character of the finishing co- lours which ground muft be clean and little lighter than the finishing colours litile lighter becaute the sinishing of shadows is glazing and no other method but glazing can leave fuch brilliancy and beauty as they ought to have for glat- the fhadows in the first painting is not to proper as laying body of fhadow co- lours that

of no ufe and the folid co- lours which are laid on it will look heavy and dull therefore all thadows and co- lours that are to be glazed should be done practical rulesfor done with colours of clean folid body becaufe the glazing is more lafting and has the beft effect on fuch colours re- member to leave no roughnets mean tuch as will appear rough and interrupt or hurt the character of the

malters veryfeldom tweetened or foftened the colours but in uniting the firft lay they were very careful in preferving the brightness of their colours and therefore did not work them below the complexion for to force or keep up brilliancy in the grounds can only be done with the whites reds and xellows which method will make up for the deficiency of the white grounds therefore practical rules for therefore the firft painting should be left bright and bold and the less the colours are broken the better we should fors bear ufing any colours that will prejudice them and be contented to add what is tvanted the next painting where if we fail clean rag will reffore the firft ground second colours st second painting the second painting begins with lay- ing on the leaft quantity that can be of oppy oil then wipe it almoft all off with dry piece of filk handkerchief the second painting is alfo divided into two parts one is called the firft lay of the second painting which is fcumb- ling the lights and glazing the fhadows the other finithing the complexion with the virgin tints and improving the like- nels as far as can be without daubing scumeling is going over the lights where they are to be changed with the lightred tints or some other of their own colours fuch as will always clear and im- drove the complexion with fhort fliff ii pencils praciical rules for pencils but fuch parts only as require it otherwife the beauty of the firft painting will be spoiled and we make double work the light-red rint improved is the very beft colour that can be for fcumbling improving the complexion in gene- ral where the shadows and drawing are to be corrected we should do it with the shade-tint by driving the colour very fiff and bare that we may the eafier retouch and change it with the finithing tints some parts of the fhadows should be glazed with some of the tranfparent tha- dow-colours fuch as will improve and come very near to the life but be fure not to lay on too much of it for fear of loting the hue of the firft painting the ground of which should always appear through the glazing be very careful in uniting the lights and shades that they do colours mix dead and mealy for the more the lights mix with the fhades the more mealy thofe shades will appear thus far the complexion is prepared and im- proved in order to receive the virgin ants and finithing touches the second part of the second painting is to go over the complexion with the virgin tints thefe are the colours which improve the colouring to the greateft per- fection both in the lights and hadows this should be done in the same manner as we laid them in the second part of the firtt painting that is with the reds yel- lows and blues blending them with deli- cate light touches of the tender middle tints without foftening we should leave the practical rules for the tints and their grounds clean and dif= tinct and be content to leave off whilft the work is fafe and unfullied leaving what is farther required for the next fitting in attempting the finithing touches before the other is dry we lofe the spirit and drawing and dirty wherever we touch the painting inoil colours jor the third paintinc or pinishing it is to be suppoted the complesion now wants very little more than few light touches therefore there will be no oc- cation for oiling begin with correcting all the glazing firft where the glazing ferves as ground or under part we should determine what should be done next that we may be able to make the alteration on the part with one ftroke of the pencil by this method we preferve both the glazing and the tints but if it happens that we can not lay fuch variety of tints and finithing colours as we intended it is much better to leave off ii practical rules for off while the work is fafe and in good order becaute thofe few touches which would endanger the beauty of the co- louring may eafily be done if we have patience to ftay till the colours are dry and then without oiling add thofe finithings with free light flrokes or the pencil belteve that rembrandt touched upon his beft pictures great many times letting them dry between it was this method moft certainly which gave them that furpriting force and fpirst which is to inimitable find it much eafier to foften the over-frong tints when they are dry than when they are wet becaufe we may add the very colours that are wanting without endangering the dry work if any of the colours of the palette want to be little changed to the life painting inohl colours roy life when we are painting it is much better to do it with the knife on the palette than with the pencil becaufe the knife will mix and leave it in good order for the pencil hi practical rules for of back-grounds van dyck made out the keeping in his back-grounds more from the different oppofition and harmony of the colours than from his knowledge of the claro obfcuro there is not in his pictures that intelligence of light and shade which to hriking and beautiful in rembrandts van dyck general method was to be very hill and mellow and to break the colours of the ground with thofe of the drapery this will certainly produce harmony the principles of which method belong only to the art of colouring but it is the knowledge of light and shade which gives that furpriting force and ftrength which at firft fight we find in rembrandts works there is picture of lady painting in oil colours tog lady where he has made the ground juft light enough to thew her complexion and hair which is dark brown in the greatelt perfection the ground is wall which near to the face is lighter than the shadows of the fleth and the light diminithes fo artfully in the gradations that though the part round the head is much darker yet it appears to be of the same colour with that near the fieth this method of relieving the head from the ground is better than van dyck' method where he has made the ground almoft of the fame colour with the hair and though his way of breaking the colours of the ground with thofe of the draperies is admirable yet there appears t near famenels as in tome of his pic- tures where he has carried this principle to near that it is almoft imperceptible in rembrandt pictures at farmouth the lights practical rules for lights and shades are as vifible as thofe in his prints and are remarkably broad clear and hill the fhadows are very warm and thin and look as if they were painted all at once with plenty of co- lour which appears tranfparent which trauparency was done by glazing the dead colouring the principal colours that are necet fary for painting of back-grounds in per- traiture as walls buildings or the like are white black indian red light and brown ochre pruffian-blue and burnt umbre from which the eight principal tints are made as follows pearl is made of black white and little indian red lead of black and white mist to dark lead-colour fellow inoil colours fellow of brown ochre and white olive

the olive is too frong.. the umbre white and dark-fhade will produce fine variety of ftone colours the dark thade and umbre ufed plentifully with atrying oil practical rules for oil make charming warm thadow-colour all the colours should be laid with drying oil only becaute they mix and fet the better with the foftener where the marks of the trowel are fo frong in the priming of the cloth that one body of colours will not be fuffi- cient to conceal it we should lay colour to prevent it which should be dry be- fore we begin with thofe parts that we expect to finith at one painting the method of painting back-grounds is divided into two parts the firft part is the work of the firft lay the second is to follow on that with the finithing tints of painting in oh colours the first lar we should always begin from the shadowed fide of the head and paint the lights firft from them go into the gra- dations and thadows which should be done with large fiffith tool very par- ingly with the dark-fhade and white little changed with the colours that will give it more of the required hue but very near in regard to tone and ftrength leaving them like mezzotinto the dark and warm fhadows should be laid before the colours that join them this we should do with the dark-fhade and umbre drove with drying oil before the colours that join them becaufe if thofe colours were laid on firft they would interrupt and fpoil the tranipa- tency practical rules for rency which is their greateft beauty the more the firft lay is drove the eafier and better we may change it with the finithing tints therefore we may lay them with the greater body the second part is to follow directly the firft lay is wet with thofe tints that we think are moft proper to harmonife and finith with begin with the lights firft and re- member as we heighten and finith them we do it with warmer colours and let thofe be accompanied with fine tender cold tints the lighteft part of the ground is always neareft to the fhadowed fide of the head this is the part which governs all the reft and should be painted with variety of light warm clear colours which vanith and lofe their firength im- perceptibly

confider it as the principal colour from the lights we go to the grada- tions and fhadows for when the lights are well adapted to produce and fupport the head it is ealy to fall from them into whatever kind of fhadows we shall find moft proper for our work then foften and blend the whole with long large tool which with the firength and body of the drying oil will mell and weeten all

make the firft lay of colours and after that the refiects and finishing tints rigut method of painting drape= fies or fatins in general is to make out the whole or the firft lay with three cos jours only viz the lights middle tint and thade tint for the lights that the colour of all the high lights—the middle tent should be very near to the general hue of painting in oil colours the fatin exc and of an exact middle degree between the high lights and the thade-tint the thade-rint should be dark enough for the general hue of all the thadows for which reafon it is called the thade-tint we should obferve that the lights should rather incline to warmith hue and the middle tint should be made of friendly working colours fuch as will always mix of clean tender coldifh hue the shade-tint should be made of the same colours as the middle tint only with lets light therefore this tint will alfo mix of tender clean colour it is with thefe three colours we should make out the whole like mezzotinto and we should underttand that all the beauty and character of the folds the shape atti- fude and principal lights and thades are practical rules for all to be confidered and made with thefe three colours only which should be done to our fatisfaction before we add any of the reffects or finishing tints the reffects of drapery and fatins are generally productions of their own and are always lighter than the fhadows on which they are found and being pro- duced by light will confequently have light warm colour mixed with the local colour that receives them here it will be neceffary to obferve the general me= thod and secret in managing the colours of the firlt lay and thofe of the reffects and finithing tints in the firft lay the high lights should be laid with plenty of fliff colour and then fhaped and foftened into character with the middle tint very correctly where paintinng in oil colours the gradations of the lights are flow as in the large parts it will be pro- per to lay the middle tint firft at their extremities with tool that will drive the colour and leave it paringly becaufe the lights will mix and he the better upon it ext make out all the parts of the fhadows with the fhade-tint drove bare after this comes the middle tint which fills up and ferves as the fecond lights and gradations and should be managed together very nicely to character without touching any of the high lights which finith the firft la reffects and finithing tints are in general the antipathies of the firft lay they will without great care porfon and dirty the colours on which they are laid and therefore should be laid with deli cate light touch without foftening if it practical rules for is over-done we muft remember to res cover it with the colour of the part on which it was laid this may be done directly or when it is dry we should alfo obferve whether the reflects proceed the same colour or any other that cie method of uting them is the fame before proceed to the particular coours it will be proper to make fome obfervations on their grounds i often happens that the colour of the cloth is very improper for the ground of the drapery and when it is we should change it with thofe colours which tre think are moft proper to improve and tupport the finithing colours this me- thod of dead -colouring muft confequently preferve them in their greateft luftres in dead-colouring we should lay the lights painting in ohl colours r and fhades in manner to as only to thew faint idea of them with regard to the shape and roundings of the figure if we have design to work from then it will be proper to make all the large and principal parts in their places which should alvrays be done with colour that is clean and lighter than the intended drapery though in general of the fame hue and let the fhadows be no darker than middle tint thefe should be mixed and broke in tender manner and then foftened with large tool to that nothing rough or uneven be left to interrupt or hurt the charalter of the finithing colours white satin all whites should be painted on white grounds laid with good body of colour practical rules for colour by reafon this colour finks more into the ground than any other there are four degrees of colours in the firft lay to white fatin the firft is the fine white for the lights the second the firtt tint which is made of fine white and very little ivory black mixed to an exact middle degree between the white and middle tint this colour follows the white and it is with this we should fhape the lights into character before we lay on any other and take care that this firtt tint appear diffindly be- tween the white and the middle tint otherwife the beauty and character of the latin will be spoiled the middle tint should be made of white black and little indian red thefe three colours are very friendly and mix in oil colours beautiful clear colour of pearly hue which has the true brightness and warmth of the general hue of the fatin re- member to allow for the red hue chang ing little to lead if there is occafion to make any part in the middle tint lighter we should do it with the firtt unt only this colour should alfo be laid paringly before the white in all the little lights that happen in the middle tints and tha- dows on which we should lay the white with one light touch and be fure not to cover all the part that was made with the firlt tint if we do it will fpoil the character and look like spot for want of the foftening edge or border which mult be between the white and the middle fint the thade-tat should be made of the same colour as the middle int but with less white to that it be dark enough for the thadows in general with practical rules for with which we should make out all the parts of the hadows nicely to character this is the work of the firft lay nent come the reffects and finithing tints brown ochre mixed with the colour of the lights is the moft ufeful colour in general for all reffects in draperies that are produced from their own colours all accidental reffexes are made with the co- lour of the parts from which they are pro- duced and the local colours that receive them there are but two reflecting tints franted for draperies in general to any one particular colour one should be lighter than the middle tint the other darker thefe colours may be little changed on the palette with the firft and middletints as occafion requires or lightly broken painting in ohl colours on the part that receives them but this laft method is not to fafe as the other the rint fufficient for blending the dark shadows to the mellow tender hue is made with the fhade-tint and little brown ochre which should be laid on very par- ingly with foft light touches for fear of making them dull and heavy if it should be over-done we may recover it with the colour it was laid upon we often fee little bhie ufed in the firft unt of white fatin van haecken who was the beft drapery-painter we ever had in england did fo and fometimes inftead of the blue he ufed bhie-black till he found it to be pernicious colour and was therefore obliged to ufe blue be- caufe his middle tint which was made only of black and whice was fo very cold that no other colour but blye would make practical rules for colder tint yet he managed thefe cold colours in all the lights and middle tints to agreeably and fo light and eafy was his touch that we can not help admiring and may learn fomething from him though he was not to lucky in his fhadows which were generally of heavy dirty hue this was owing to the colours he ufed and the method of uling them which will always have fuch an effect when warm or dirty colour is mixed with clean light one for being mixed together they will form dirty colour that muft confequently appear to in the work bur if his lead or thade- fint had been mised with indian red in- stead of the cchre and then followed with few light blending touches of the ochre- tint it would have left them clean and mellow it is the want of the red hue which makes the white fatins appear fo often like pewter blue painting inoil colours satin bl ve fatn is made of pruffian-blue and fine white the beft ground for blue is white for the lights and black and white for the shadows the firft lay of colours for blue is di= into three degrees or tints we should firft make the middle tint of beaunful azure then mis the colour for the lights about middle degree between that and where make the fhade-fint dark enough for the fhadows in general all the broad lights should be laid with plenty of colour and shaped to character with the middle tint before we lay on any practical rules for any other colours remember the lets the colours are mixed the better they will appear and fland for the lights of blue should be managed with as much care as thote of white fatin next is to follow with the reft of the middle tint and then make out all the fhadows the more we drive the fhade-tint the better it will receive the reffects and finithing fints the fhadows should be ftrength- ened and blended with ivory-black and tome of their own colour which will mix with them into tender mellow hue the reflects are made as thofe of white fatin that with ochre and fome of the lights which should be perfectly done as we intend it at one painting the fhadows when dry may be little im- proved if there is occafion to alfer them with paintinginoil colours the colours they were made with the pruffian-blue proper to be ufed is that which looks of the moft beautiful ature before it is ground and the fooner it is ufed after it is ground the better it will work and appear velvet may be painted at once the method is to make out the firft lay with the middle tint and shade tint on which we should lay the high lights with light touches and finith the fhadows as we did thofe of the fatin but the nearelt imita- tion of velvet we can make is done by glazing which is prepared on ground or dead -colouring of fuch colours as will when dry bear out and fupport the glar- ing colour in iis higheft perfection the nature of the glazing colour is to be of fine tranfparent quality and ufed fimply with oil only to that whatever ground i practical rules for it is laid on the whole may appear di- ough the beft ground for blue is made with white and white is for the high lights which with the middle tint and fhade-tint makes out the firtt lay like merzotinto remember to make the middle tint lighter in proportion to the glaring becaufe that will make it the darker it is often ne- ceffary to cover all but the high lights with thin glazing not with plenty of in the colour but laid with lets quan- tity than if ii was to be done once only if any of it touch the lights we should wipe it off with clean rag the very high lights should be improved and made of fine white and left to dry the coiour prman-blue ground very fine with nui oil and should be lard with large nhith tool that will drive colour as occation requires it o in ohl colours the latt glazing we should frengthen and finith the fhadows the greateft fault in the colouring of draperies is the painting the shadows with hrong glaring colours which defiroy the beauty of the lights this is not only the reverfe of art but of nature whofe beauty always diminithes in proportion with the lights for this reafon we should take care to blend and foften the fhadows with fuch friendly colours as will agree with their local character and obicurity here we may obferve that glazing the middle tint which is made of black and white will not produce colour to blue as if it had been prepared with pruffian- blue and white yet this colour will pre- serve the beauty of the lights in the higheft perfection by reafon of its tender obicure hue when the blueness of the other practical rules for would only diminith them this method of glazing the blue is the general rule for all glazing when we are glazing blue the lights may be glazed with ultramarine though all the other parts are done with prulfian blue this method faves great quan- tity of that valuable colour and anfivers our purpofe as well as if it had all been done with ultramarine thowgh this general method of paint- ing latins is to make the firtt lay of co- lours with three degrees of tints yet we should underfland in uling them that they produce two more for the mixing of two diffcrent colours together on the cloch will make another of middle tint between them to it is with the lights and middle tint and with the middle and shade= painting in ohl colours the firft anfwers to the firft sint in white fatin and the laft will con- sequently be fort of gradating or half- shade if the lights and middle tint mix to beautiful clean colour of middle hue between both there will be no occafion for colour to go between them as in the blue fatin but if in mixing they produce tint inclining to dirty warm hue then there muft be another found of fympathizing nature which should he laid between them in order to preferve the beauty of the lights as the firft tint in the white fatin for if it was not fo the red in the middle tint would certain- ly dirty and fpoil the whire ir is highly necelfary to underlland thefe principles of the firft lay of colours in practical rules for in order to have perfect knowledge of the general rule of colouring on which the principles of colouring depend scarlet and crimsonn ad licti yellow-red made of light cchre lightred and white is the proper ground for fearlet the shadows are indian red and in the darked parts mixed with very little black the second painting should be little fighter than we intend the finithing co- lour in proportion to the glazing which will make it darker the high lights are vermition and white for fatin velvet and cloth the miditle is vermition and white with tef in oil colours litle lake or indian red the shade- tint is made with indian red and lake with the addition of little black in the darkeft fhadows the difference between fearlet and crimfon is that the high lights of crimfon are whiter and the middle tint is made darker their reflects are made with lightred and vermilion the high lights should be laid and managed in the fame manner as thofe of the blue for fear of dirtying them and fometimes they require to be touched over the fe- cond time before we glaze them the more the colours of the second painting are drove the eafier and better they may be managed to character but the high lights should have good body of colour and be left with delicate light touch after it is well dry we should linith with glazing the whole with fine lake and im= prove the reflects and thadows remem- her practical rules for ber that the fearlet requires but very thin glaring and it is better to glaze the crimfon twice over than lay too much at one painting pine-colour there are two different methods of painting pink colour one is by glaz- ing the other is done with body of co= lours at one painting the same grounds do for both which should be whitifh colour inclining to yellow for the lights and indian red lake and white for the thadows the second

the fineff green we have for drapery made of king yellew pruffian-blue and brown pink the high lights are king yellow and very little pruffian- blue the middle tint has more pruffian- blue and the

should be managed in the fame manner as thofe of the blues the fhade tint should be kept entirely from the lights becaufe the brown pink that is in will in mixing dirty them as the black does thofe of the blues remember to allow for their dry- ing little darker and that the king' yellow should be ground with good dry- ing oil for the longer it is drying the more it will change and grow darker and the fooner it is ufed the better it will fland it is proper to have two forts of king yellow- one to be very light which will do beft for the high lights of relvet changeable paintingnoil colours colours are made with four principal tints viz the high lights middle tint shade tint and reflect- ing tint the greatelf art lies in finding the exact colour of the middle tint becaute it has more of the general hue of the filk than any of the others the shade-tint is of the fame hue with the middle tint though it is dark enough for the fhadows the high lights though often very dif- ferent from the middle tint should be of clean friendly-working colour that will in mixing with it produce tint of clean fympathizing hue the method of painting filks is to make out the folds with the fhade tint and practical rules for and then fill them up in the lights with the middle tint this is the firft lay which should be done to our fatisfaction before we add any other colours and the hiffer the middle tint is uted the better the high lights may be laid upon the reffecdingunt falls generally upon the gradating half-fhades and should be laid with tender touches paringly for fear of fpoiling the firft lay this method of painting antwers to all coloured filks as well as changeable with this difference only that the plain colours require not fo much art in match- ing the tints as the changeable do the laft part of the work is the finithing and rrengthening the fhadows with an obfcure int little inclining to mellowith hue tuch as will not carch the eye and inter- rupt the beauty of

little lake the mid- dle tint has lets white and more lake and black the fhade-tint is made of an equal quantity of lake and brown pink with very little black the method of painting black is very different from that of other colours for as the principal thing in them is to leave their lights clean and brilliant fo in black it is to keep the fhadows clear and tranf- parent therefore we should begin with the shade-tint and glaze over all the sha- dows practical rules for dows with it next lay in the darkeft lhadows with black and little of the thade-tinr very corredly after that fill up the whole breadth of lights with the middle tint only all which should be done exactly to the character of the fatin exc and then finish with the high lights here we may obferve the ground being red will bear out and fupport the reds which are ufed in the finithing co- lours the lake in the lights takes off the cold hue and gives it more beautiful colour if the fhade-tint was of any other colour than tranfparent warm hue the ihadows would confequently be black and becaufe no other colours can pre- heavy ferve the warm brilliancy which is want- ing in the fhadows of the black like lake and brown pink black is of cold heavy nnature and always too flrong for any other painting inoil colours colour therefore we should make an allowance in uling it there will be few reflects in fatin which should be added as thofe of other colours but they should be made of flrong colours fuch as burnt umbre or brown ochre mixed with little of the shade-tint thovo the grounds which are here mentioned for the draperies are abfolutely neceffary for the principal and neareft figures in picture fuch as fingle por- trait or the like yet they are not in- tended for figures which are placed more into the picture

now tuppofing this glazed ground is properly adapted to the object and place it will be eafy to find the other colours which are wanted for the lights and fi- nithings of the fame but in laying them we mult take great care that we do not fpoil the glazing therefore we should be very exact in preparing thofe colours on the palette and then be fure to lay them with ight free touches before m

manage them like indian ink and the more diffint we leave them the better their tranfparent beauty will fland and appear provided we do it with good drying oil after thefe four glazing co- lours burnt

warm hade when it is drove with drying oil no colour in the world is to fweet and fympathiting it mixes harmonioutly with all the lights as well as the thadows and is charming colour paintinginoil colours in the trunks and bodies of trees and in all kinds of buildings we should make out all the ground of the objects with fuch glazing fhadow- colours as feem neareft to the natural hue of the object in that fituation but as the principal glazing colours themfelves are often too firong and glaring they should therefore be little changed and foftened with fuch colours as are of near re- temblance to themfelves and the objects thus if it is in the diftances the terra- verte and azure which are their principal glazing colours may be improved and made lighter with fome of the fky tints and as the diftances come nearer with the purple fis we get more into the middle group the terra-verte and pruffian- blue may be changed with some of the green tints fuch as are made without white m practical rules for white for white is the deftruction of all glazing colours as we approach the firft group there is lets occafion for changing them but the fore-ground and its ob- jelts require all the arength and force of glazing which the colours are capable of producing after this glazing ground we should follow with firengthening the fame in the thadows and darkeft places in fuch man- ner as will feem eaty to finith which is the firft lay of the second painting the colours that come next for finish- ing are in the degree of middle tints thefe should be carefully laid over the greateff breadth of lights in fuch manner as not to fpoil and cover too much of the glazing do it with good body of the colour as fliff as the pencil can agreeably manage painting inole colours t to character remember the colours of the middle tint should be of clean beautiful hue according to thefe methods think it will be eaty to finith all the second painting as we work down from the fky through the middle group as we come to the firft group where all the objects should appear perfectly finithed we should finith their under or moft diftant parts before we paint any of the other which appear nearer oblefye this me- thod down to the laft and neareft objects of the picture and where it fo happens that painting one tree over another does not pleafe forbear the second until the firft is dry thin near trees of different colours will do better if we let the under parts dry before we add the finithing colours the practical rules for the third and last painting if oiling is neceffary lay the leaft quan- tity that can be which should be done with rump-tool or pencil proportioned to the place that is to be oiled to that we may oil no more than is wanted then wipe the whole place that is oiled with piece of filk handkerchief by this me- thod we leave no more oil than is proper for our purpofe when we are going to finith any ob- jects we should remember to ule great variety of tints very near of the same co- lour but moft of all when we are finith- ing trees this gives richness to the colouring and produces harmony the greens paintinginoil colours will fade and grow darker there- fore it is highly neceffary to improve and force them by exaggerating the lights and making an allowance in uling them to much the lighter for the fame reafon we should take great care that we do not overcharge and fpoil the beauty of the glazing for if we do it will be dull and heavy and will confequently grow darker the method for painting near trees is to make the firft lay very near to nature though not quite fo dark but more in the degree of middle tint and follow it with frengthening the fhadows and im- proving the middle tints and laft of all lay the high lights and finithing colours but all this can not be done as it should be at one painting therefore the beft way is to do no more than the firtt lay with practical rules for with the faint fhadows and leave it to dry then begin with improving the mid- dle tints and fhadows and let them dry the third and laft work is adding all the lights and finithing colours in the beft manner we are able this method of leaving the firtt and second part to dry fe- parately not only makes the whole much ealier and more agreeable but leaves the colours in the greateft perfection becaufe moft of the work may be done with fcum- bling and glazing and fome parts without oiling the lights alfo may be laid with better body of colour which will not be mixed and fpoiled with the wet ground what have faid of trees anfwers the tame to all kinds of thrubs and buthes the painting in ohl colours figures in landlcape are the laft work of the picture thofe in the fore- ground should be done firft and thofe in the diftances next for after the figures in the firft and fartheft group are painted it will be much eafier to find the proportions of thofe in the middle parts of the picture and we should obferve that the fhadows of the figures should be of the same hue or colour with thofe of the group or place they are in epitome orit .. aa very valuable work now fcarcely procurable at any rate was published by the late ingenious le blon

important of all colours in painting it affords to the painter the materials of light which he diftributes in fuch manner as to bring his objects together to give them relict and that magic which is the glory of his art forthefe reafons my attention will be confined to this colour the firft white which was difcovered and on white pigments indeed the principal one yet known is extracted from lead the danger of the process and the dreadful diftemper with which thofe employed in it are often feized have not yet led to the difcovery of another white less anx ous about the danger of the artiff than the perfection of the art they have va- ried the preparation to render the colour lets liable to change fience the diffe- rent kinds of white viz white of crems in auffria white lead in shells and white ceruffe bur every perfon converfant in colours knows that the foundation of all thefe is the cals of lead more or lets pure or more or less loaded with gas that they all participate of this metallic fubftance will indeed be evident from the following experiment which demon- ftrates and determines the alterability of colours by phlogiflic vapours poured onn.whiite pigments poured into large glats bottle of liver of fulphur on bafis quantity of qlkali fixed or volatile it makes no difference added fome drops of diftilled vinegar and covered the mouth of the bottle with piece of pafteboard cut to its lize on which difpoted different famples of crems of white lead and of ceruffe in oil and in water placed another ring of pafieboard over the firft and tied above all piece of bladder round the neck of the hottle with firong packthread it is evident that in this operation took ad= vantage of the means which chemiftry offers to produce great quantiry of phlo= giftic vapour to accomplith inflantane oully the effect of many years and in few words to apply to the colours the very fame vapours to thich picture is neceffarily expofed only more accumu- lated and concentrated

continu- ally quantity more orless of matter not only analogous but identically the fame with the vapour of vitriolic acid mixed with fulphur ir it happen that the famples of colour are fenlibly altered by the phlogiftic va- pour then we may conclude with cer- tainty that the materials of which the colour is compoted bear great affinity to that vapour and fince it is not pof- fible to preferve them entirely from it in anyfituation that they will be more or lets affected with it according to the time and valiety of circumstances after come minutesconfinuance in this vapour on whiite pigments vapour examined the famples of co- lours fubmitted to ius infinence and found them wholly altered the ceruffe and the white lead both in water and oil were changed into black and the white of crems into brownith black and hence thofe colours are bad and ought to be abandoned they may indeed be de- fended in fome meature by varnith but this only retards for time the contact of the phlogiffic vapour for as the varnish lofes iis humidity it opens an infinite number of paffages to this fubtile find after having afcertained the inrlab lity of the whites in common ufe made leveral attempts to dilcover fuch as would prove more latting and though many of thefe attempts were without effect thail give fuccinet account of the whole which may fave great deal of trouble to thofe on white picments who with to travel over the fame field there are three conditions effential to good colour in painting first that it dilute eafily and take body both with oils and with mucilages or at leaft with the one or the other of thefe fubltances circumftance which depends on certain degree of affinity where this affinity is too flrong diffe- lution enfues the colour is extinguished in the new compolition and the mats be- comes more or lets tranfparent or elfe the fudden re-action abforbs the fluid and leaves only dry fubltance which can never again be foftened but if the be too weak the particles of colour fcarcely fuspended in the ffuid and eteis on whiite pigments they appear on the canvals like fand which nothing can fix or unite the second condition is that the materials of which colours are compoted do not bear too near an affinity with the phlogiffic vapour the experiments to which fubmitted whites from lead are the infallible means of afcertaining the quality of colours in this respect without waiting for the low impreffion of time third condition equally effential is that the colouring body be not volg- tile that it be not connected with fub- ftance of weak texture fufceptible of pontaneous degeneracy this confi- deration excludes the greater part of fub- stances which have received their tint front vegetable wtitte pigmen.. organization at leaft it makes impoffible to incorporate their finer parts with combination more folid after thefe reflections my refearches were directed firll to the five pure earths next to the metallic earths either pure of precipitated by pruffian alkalit wen= has difcovered fixth earth which call eburne and which after other ex- beriments thought of applying to the purpofes of painting but foon perceiv- ed that it would have the fame fault with other kinds of earth and befides that it could not be obtained but at very con- fiderable expence the five pure eaiths poffels fixity in very great degree and at the same time no the article prussian-elue in the materin pictoria ae on white pigments are little affected by the phlogiftic vapour but they refufe to unite with oils or mu- cilages and the white is totally extin- guithed when they are ground with thofe liquids made feveral attempts on earth of alum not only becaufe beaume recommended the ufe of it in painting and becaufe it enters into the compofition of pruffian-blue but alfo becaufe it is chief ingredient in ochres and other earths of that nature which indicates that it would unite in certain degree with diluting liquors notwithllanding in whatever manner treated it it would not yield white but one will be less furprifed at this want of fuccess when it is confidered that in the ochres and pruffian-blue the earth from alum is only the vehicle of the colouring body whereas here it is the colour itfelf to be convinced of the truth of this obfer- on white picments it is only neceffary to mix equal parts of this earth or even of clay not coloured with ceruffe or any other white the mixture will be fufceptible of being ground in oil or in gum without being extinguithed it will eafily unite with any coloured

as the jaspek white the feldspat white the schirl white exc but all thefe fubltances in all the trials made had the fault which have al ready mentioned and oiginating from the fame caufe they wanted fixed co- louring body which would not change on white pigmennts when pulverized nor be extinguished when dilnted the ultramarine blue which is ex= tratted from the blue jafper and known by the name of lapis lazuli feems at firft view to warrant the poftibility of appro- priating to painting all the opague half- vitrified compofitions of the nature of jatper prepossessed with this idea con- ceived the hope of producing true white lapis but foon perceived that the ex- periment confirmed the principle which had laid down from my obtervations on pure earths fince it is not the fubitance peculiar to the jafper which conftitutes the uhramarine blue but the metallic subftance which accidentally colours this particular kind of jafper in whiiie pigments the fame manner art in this imita= tion of nature should have for its object to give permanent bafe to colour al ready formed to fix it without altering and to augment perhaps its plendour and its intenfity without attempting to pro- duce colour in excepting from earthy and metallic falts all thofe of which the acid is not completely faturated which would eafily attract the moifture of the air or which would be eafily diffolved

thefe nine fubllances we may pats over filver and mercury becaute though they yield very fine white precipitated by means of pure dry vegetable alkali yet it is foon altered when expofed to the air that from filver into black and that from mercury into yellow ir is well known that lead gives very good white and one which unites eafily with oil or fize but that it is extremely liable to change has been my principal object to prove and the experiments have made place it beyond contradiction shall only add that if there be reparation able to correct this fault it should be the precipitation of the earth of this metal from an acctous folution by the pruffian alkali but the white which refults from this preparation becomes fen- fibly on wihite pigments libly brownish when it is expofed fers minutes only to the phlogiffic vapour ir would be therefore unreafonable to perfevere in the ufe of this fubllance or to with to render it fixed fince the changes which it undergoes do not alter iis nature and the indeftructible order of iis affinities the calx of fin is ealily applied to any purpofe and experiences no change from the concentrated phlogiffic vapour thefe confiderations induced me to endeavour to obtain this calx perfectly white and here follows the refull of my experi- malacca tin calcined gives pretty white calx but whatever atten- tion paid to take off the red

effervelcent alkali have calcined this femi-metal alone and with nitre and in all thefe operations have obtained an earthy fub- ftance of different degrees of whitenels which after it was dried and prepared mixed readily with oil and mucilage without loting its colour and which ex- perienced no fentible change when ea poted to the phlogiffic vapour these valuable properties the chief object of my refearches engaged me to my experiments to determine at once the moff economical procets and the moft advantageous and infallible preparation.— thefe attempts have con- vinced oh whilik iigments me that the calcination of this lemi-metal alone in crucible placed ho- fizontally on the corners of reverberat ing furnace gives the pureft the whitelt and the leaft reducible cals and that to make an excellent colour it is fufficient to teparate with water the parts unburned and grind it with little of the earth of alum or chalk to give it body linc precipitated by pruffian alkali even in diftilled vinegar retains always fhade of yellow does not unite to well in oil and takes femi-tranfparent confiffence like cheefe arsenic extinguithes much lets in diluting than one would believe from its faline nature it preferves its colour beft in guim-water and it is remarkable that infead of turning black in the phlo- giflic vert whlle pigments giftic vapour it takes very diftinct fhade of yellow this property is fufficiently fingular and conflant to furnish new method of analyfing arfenic to as to know it and this alteration of colour makes it of no ufe in painting although its deleterious qualities might alone pre= vent the practice the femi-metal known by the name of manganese gives allo white calx had at firft great hopes from this colour as contrary to all thofe extracted from the other meials it became white by the phlogiffic vapour there remained therefore but one difficulty to overcome vit to feparate from the manganefe the portion of iron which it afually contains and which infallibly makes the earth little yellow to accomplith this in the cheapeft manner fubmitted the black ore on white pigments of manganele to long calcination to render its iron infoluble after- wards applied vinegar to it after the ex- ample of de la peyroufe and in precipitating the folution by alkall cafily obtained pure white precipitate but foon perceived that the facility with which colouring body lofes its phlogifton is no lefs an inconvenience than that of attracting it and productive of the fame alterations the white of manganefe became very foon yellow when expoted to the air and this is not to be afcribed to the iron contained in it fince neither the galls or pruffian alkali had difcovered any of it in the folution this fubliance therefore can be of no ufe in producing white colour for painting placed on whiite pigments placed wben the experiments were made in my apparatus pieces of cloth on which were laid the white of calcare- ous tartar different preparations of white from tin and zinc in oil and water and allowed them to continue expoted to the phlogiffic vapour during the fit of the academ if they were not altered their fuperiority over the whites in ufe would be fufficiently efta- blifhed the fitting continued for near an hour and the bottle having been opened all the colours continued to have the fame hade which they had before can therefore recommend to painters thofe three whites and particularly that of the preparation of which is ex- pofed to less variation the fhade more lively and uniform and moreover it is dijon sit on white pigments for all purpofes and perhaps procured at lefs expence will affert farther that it may be procured in fufficient quantities to fupply the place of ceruife in every branch of the art even in interior houle-paint- would recommend it less with view of adding new fplendor to this kind of ornament than for the fafety of thofe who are employed in and perhaps for the fafety of thofe who inhabit houfes ornamented in this manner bur without being too fanguine al though the procels in the preparation be timplified in proportion to the demand as is ufually the cafe yet there is reafon would it not anfwer the purpofes of an inge- nious colourman to prepare and yend this pir- ment on white pigments to apprehend that the low price of ce- ruffe will always give it the preference in houfe painting with regard to thofe who apply colours to nobler purpofes they will not helitate to employ the white of am aftured that four livres is paid for pound of white of crems and believe the white in question pre- pared in the manner which have point ed out might be fold for fix ni courtors connected with the laboratory of the academy has already declared that it is ufed in houfe-paining lets in regard to its unalterability than its folubility and this may be the more readily believed as the fowers of into many compofitions of the apo- thecary al courtors has alfo arrived at the art of giving more body to this white which the painters feemed to defire and of on white pigments making it bear comparifon with white lead erther in water or oil the only fault found with it is its drying too llowly when ufed in oil but fome ex- periments which have made incline me to believe that this fault may be eafily remedied or greatly corrected by giving it more body at any rate it may be rendered ficcative at pleature by adding little vitriol of zine white copperas hlightly calcined painters already know the proper- ties of this fall but perhaps they do not know that it mixes with the white of better than with any other colour for the reafon that they have chemically the same bafe it is prepared by depriv- ing the white copperas of that fmall por- tion of iron which would render it yel- low which is eafily done by digeft- ing onn wiiite picments ing folution of it on the filings of tinc mikture of this falt thus prepared may be made on the palette which will
