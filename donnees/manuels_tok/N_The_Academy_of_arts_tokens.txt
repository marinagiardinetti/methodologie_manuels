the whole forming complete system of the arts of drawing painting engraving in their various branches calcu lated to entertain the mind and improve taste and genius london printed for taylor ° dyer ’ buildings holborn taylor opposite great turnstile holborn and nicoll st. paul church-yard dcc lxxxiii to the public the cultivation of the arts has always been considered as proof of the learning and good sense of the times it has ever accompanied civilized society and polished manners contributing largely to the amusement and delight of the mind the arts become objects of attention to every person of taste and leisure the arts of design are universally admitted to the most honor able station as elegant and useful attainments they have consti tuted principal part of accomplished education in every polite country never were they so universally esteemed never was the applause of the british public so liberally bestowed as of late but perhaps the most striking proof of approbation is the assiduity with which they are cultivated by almost every lady and gentleman yet it must be acknowledged that considerable impediments pre¬ vent these desirable acquisitions from being so general as might be wished.—the difficulty of procuring respectable masters together with the expence attending this branch of polite education deprives many young persons of both sexes of that opportunity of im provement which their talents deserve such an opportunity is pre sented to them at very moderate purchase by this publication its copious directions are calculated to supersede the necessity of any other instructor while as an introduction to the arts of design in general it furnishes truly elegant and rational amusement by presenting an almost infinite variety of subjects conducted with strict regard to delicacy and virtue the “ human face divine '' as milton expresses it will be treated wich ihe greatest attention from the first principles to the most ex pressive countenance the whole-length figure attitudes draperies and composi tion will be justly and correctly explained landscape will form most entertaining series and its universal aflistant perspective will be presented in its various branches as well as architecture and ornament flowers have ever been considered as most delightful part of natural history to accommodate them more immediately to the intent of this work they will be coloured from nature which it is hoped may not only recommend them to the patronage of the la dies who have constantly adopted flowers among the ornaments of dress but by displaying the superior elegance of our native productions may banish those exotic devices which have too much prevailed nor are these the limits of our plan the art of painting in oil crayons and water colours with che manner of composing colours crayons varnishes engraving in its various branches and many other useful and amusing sciences will be explained to which mar be added proper dictionary of terms of art em blematical subjects and ancient mythology so far as connected with the arts such are the outlines of this publication every care and atten tion will be bestowed in its execution to render it honorable to the arts and worthy the patronage of the public the academy of arts is is true that genius and inclination will surmount great dissi culties those which are insuperable to some others may surpass by severe labor yet is is grateful task to remove impediments from the pach to knowledge and the greater the genius the more will the obligation be felt and acknowledged for instruction especially if clear and easy to follow is most prized by those who are most capable of prositing by it the arts of design embrace great variety of subjects and need an equal variety of precepts it is too diflicult for the young adventurer to attend to many at once we purpose therefore to treat them separately the art of drawing as the foundation of all other arts claims our first attention not only umiversally admired as elegant and ornamental but it ’ acknowledged utility enhances it ’ value this art lends assistance to many professions not confined to painters engravers embroiderers whose employments evi dently depend upon it it is daily practised by the mathematician engineer and navigator to be able to design on the spot striking prospect noble building curious production of art or an uncommon appearance of nature is not only desirable amusement but useful ac complishment to preserve to remote posterity the resemblances of illustrious personages—to transmit objects of attention to foreign climes—is no inconsiderable attainment we are pleased with the genius and abilities of distant artists in return our own perf formances command their applause hereby ihe productions of nature or art in all parts of the globe become familiar to us we contemplate without danger the inhabitants of the poles the groen lander in his hut the siberian in his cave mountains of ice monsters of the deep the bite of the rattle-snake the sting of the scorpion strike us with no dread nor are we exposed to in conveniencies though examining the manners of the chinese or the hottentot no wonder an art so univerfally uleful fhould be ad¬ mired and distinguished as one of the highest embellishments of human life drawing is the art of representing the appearances of objects it expresses by lines and shades the resemblance of any thing whatever and even produces to the view of others the conceptions of the mind the materials used in drawing are black lead pencils— chalks black white and red— square— parallel ruler— compaffes—pens—camel ’ -hair pencils—indian ink and indian rubber various sorts of paper are used to work upon for indian ink white and fine—for chalk more rough and coarse—for black and white chalk blue or brown according to the fancy of the designer the young designer should by all means draw his studies large thereby avoiding that confusion of lines almost inseparable from smaller subjects for having once attained strong and distinct idea of his object he will find much less difficulty in reducing than in enlarging it this premised it is adviseable to commence the study of this noble art by drawing first in chalks being beiter calculated than indian ink not only for the size of the design but as they contribute greatly to bold and free handling which is very desir able acquisition ease and facility not only expedite business but give certain master-like appearance which elaborate neatness can not equal to begin drawing in chalks first form sketch from the original with piece of charcoal of convenient thickness and length this is the best material to sketch with as it admits of be ing frequently rubbed out consequently the outline of the subject may be rendered very correct before it is finished in chalk ac custom yourself to hold your port crayon or pencil further from the point than in writing that it may not impede the free motion of your hand it is not amiss to caution the young designer against cutting his chalk to too sharp point which does more harm by preventing proper boldness than it does good in respect of neatness neat¬ ness should be the result of judgment as well as of care and la bour or it will infallibly be stiff and awkward the use of the black lead pencil is to form an accurate outline of any design intended to be finished in indian ink the india rubber erases black lead lines very neatly the square ruler and compasses are necessary in drawing perspective architecture but should never be applied to figures the designer should accustom himself to see correctly without such injurions assistances as great master expressed himself '' the compasses should be in the eye not in the hand '' before you begin your performance confider your original wich close attention divide it in your mind into several parts observe the length the breadth and similitude of each part remark their proportion to each other and to the whole their respective distances and situations more especially attend to those objects or parts which fall immediately under others and those which are parallel to others if this rule is duly practised it will prevent any material error as the excellence of drawing consists in its accu racy endeavour to make vour sketch as corrcct as possible never proceed to shadow or finish any part of drawing till the lines of the skeich have attained close resemblance to the original al ways remembering to begin at the left part of your paper that what you are about may be continually visible the right side of your drawing is liable to be covered by your right hand and even by your arm if the paper is large some persons are apt to lean their stomach and arms upon their drawing or table which is very unhealthy custom and even injurions to the performance it is well worth while to remember this since the whole is habit and good posture may as readily be obtained as bad one the more upright you sit the better the distance of the original from your eye demands another caution if too near it not only prevents proper view of the whole subject you copy but is not free from danger of rendering the eyes short fighted supposing the young designer with à good original now be fore him and proper materials in hand it remains before we procced to the next part of our subject to remind him that reso lution is the very life of his undertaking difficulties will occur he must surmount them others may present themselves they like wise must be overcome having subdued the first he is more able to combat the second the same have presented themselves to the greatest masters the art will reward the resolute as fuch let him expect success of the human figure the human figure considered not only as the most ex pressive and beautiful but also the most interesting object claims our first attention it is customary to divide the figure into three parts the head the body and the members which move upon the body dr. hunter indeed considers the head as member moving upon the body but this division is peculiar to himfelf to convey more readily just ldea of the excellence proper to each part we shall treat of it under the articles proportion character and expression corresponding to the degrees of comparison in grammar in reference to which we may call well-proportioned head body good one not only well pro portioned but exhibiting certain natural likeness or character may be denominated better and if to well-proportioned character be be superadded happy and forcible expression it is the summit of excellence in the art and the artist the general proportions of the figure we propose somewhat to explain before we proceed to the separate parts as thereby may be attained more distinct idea of the method used in measuring those parts as well as ihe figure the most regular manner of measur ing an object is to take for standard part whose proportion is usually most obvious and permanent therefore the figure is con sidered as containing in height or breadth fo many measures of the head as the head contains so many measures of the nose the best antique statues have seven heads seven and half to seven and three quarters in height the most eminent artists conform in their works to this standard the figures engraved being marked by scale of heads sufficiently explain themselves to which may here be added that the arms of man when ex tended are in length equal to his height from one side of the breasts to the other is one head and half from the shoulder to the elbow one and half from the elbow to the end of the little finger one and half the hand exactly spans the face the thumb contains one nose the sole of the foot is onc sixth part of the height of the figure dismissing for the present the proportions of the figure we pro cced to consider the parts into which we have divided it of the head which in the language of artists often includes besides the face so much of the neck as is neccessary to give proper air and expression but is here confidered as comprehending only from the chin upwards nature has made the countenance not only the seat of great beauty but of universal expression nor is there any passion of the mlind or sensation of the body which does not discover itself in the movements of the features as the head is the chief seat of character which differs in different subjects and implies vari ation of proportion it is less bound by fixed rules than any other though ever so wanton and playful attention should be paid to the natural disposition of the sexes doll which as toy well enough becomes girl is improper for boy as manly ex ercises horses or arms which are the delight of boys are not pleasing in the softer sex the character of the heads of adult persons opens very extensive field for investigation wherein we should consider not only the now very visible distinction of sexes but also the ef fects of natural inclination of acquired habit and of various rank in life the difference between the natives of one country and another and the influence of those numerous disorders to which the human frame is subject all which arc clearly discernible to those whose attention has been employed upon the subject the following remarks are taken from the ingenious author quoted above whose expedients to mark the characters in his per formances are singularly happy we have daily many instances which confirm the common received opinion that the face is the index of the mind and this maxim is so rooted in us we can scarce help if our attention be little raised forming fome particular conception of the lper son mind whose face we are observing even before we receive information by any other means how often is it said on the slightest view that such one looks like good-natured man that he hath an honest open countenance or looks like cun ning rogue man of sense or fool and how are our eyes rivetted to the aspects of kings and heroes murderers and saints and as we contemplate their deeds seldom fail mak ing application to their looks it is reasonable to believe that aspect to be true and legible representation of the mind which gives every spectator the same idea at first sight and is after wards confirmed in fact for inftance all concur in the same opinion at first sight of downright idiot there is but little more to be seen by children ’ faces than that they are lively or heavy and scarcely that unless they are in motion very handsome faces of almost any age will hide foolish or wicked mind till they betray themselves by their actions or their words yet the frequent awkward movements of the muscles of the pool ’ face though ever so handsome is apt in time to leave such traces up and down it as will distin guish defect of mind upon examination bur the bad man he be an hypocrite may so manage his muscles by teaching them to contradict his heart that little of his mind can be ga thered from his countenance so that the character of an hypo crite is entirely out of the power of the pencil withom some ad joining circumstance to discover him as smiling and stabbing at the fame time or the like it is by the natural and unaffected movements of the muscles caused by the passions of the mind that every man ’ character would in some measure be written in his face by that time he arrives at forty years of age were it not for certain accidents which often though not always prevent it for the ill-natured man by frequently frowning and pouting out the muscles of his mouth doth in time bring those parts to constant state of the appearance of ill-nature which might have been prevented by the constant affectation of smile and so of the other passions though there are some which do not affect muscles at all simply of themselves as love and hope but left shou be thought to lay too great stress on outward show it is ac knowledged there are so many different causes which produce the same kind of movements and appearances of the features and so many thwartings by accidental shapes in the make of faces that the old adage fronti nulla fides will ever stand it' ground upon the whole and for very wise reasons nature hath thought fit it should but on the other hand in many particular cases we receive great information from the expres sions of the countenance after which remarks this attentive observer proceeds to recom mend the expressions in le brun ’ passions of the mind com plete edition of which excellent performance will be given in this work it is certain that we expect from kings and noblemen verv dif ferent demeanour and address from that of rustics and clowns and to see in them an air of dignity and grandeur which we sup pose distinguishes them from the crowd it is true hero or king in not always tall or comely nor can the mind be universally traced in the lineaments of the commntenance yet as design can not represent the mind but through the medium of the body commendable liberty to exhibit such features as most immediately characterize to the spectator the subject intended suppose king be represented at the head of his troops we naturally look for more martial air and greater gallanter in the king than in the soldiers who though valiant must yet shew valour less elevated in character than that of their leader or if the sub ject be magistrate condemning thief the characters of both must be so discriminated as to prevent inquiry which is thie judge and which che culpri if che detign be an exchange amidst all the confusion occasioned by the crowding multitude the artist must carefully attend to che character proper to the natives of each country who may be transacting business group of counte¬ nances resembling american indians would ill fuit ihe turkish walk nor would the saturnine features of an hollander agree with the dress and expedted levity of frenchman sailor must be distinguished from the merchant conversing with him as the merchant himself must be from others around him little reflection upon these hints is sufficient to demonstrate the import ance of this principle and the necessity of treating it with care and attention as the intent of this work is to assist the young designer in the study of nature whose appearances are the object of our pre sent attention it would be beside our purpose to enter into mys teries of physiognomy science “ puzzled in mazes and per plexed wich errors '' though many great names have thought it the foundation of this part of the art and an eminent virtuoso of germany has lately supported it in all it ’ extremes yet perhaps it may not be totally useless to remark that the animal part of man is apparently governed by the same laws as animals in general and that when the human countenance is similar in it parts to those of certain animals the man is supposed to have similar dis positions features of the swine the ox the sheep and even the lion have been found in some faces socrates is an indubitable instance of the first and cromwell of ihe last at the sight of whose whose portrait northern potentate is said to have exclaimed. “ '' protest he makes me tremble it may not be improper to insert some of those differences which have been observed to distinguish the human species for notwith standing there are animals void of reason whose forms approach in appearance very near to that of man and the features of some men resemble parts of certain animals yet there are strong and permanent marks of distinction the eyes of man are placed on line with the auditory nerve those of brute animals are on the contrary much lower and nearer to the nose according to their natural dispositions ii man is able to clevate the ball of the eye which animals can not do without lifting up the nose their eyeballs may turn fo far downwards as to fliew portion of white above ihe iris but are utterly incapable of turning upwards iii the eyebrows of animals never meet and always decline at their extremities while those of the human countenance ap proach each other in the middle of the forehead and elevate their terminations on the sides of the nose to return from this digression dur subject leads us to consider that we have represented character as variation of proportion which by adding to one part seems to diminish the rest those parts of the face which chiefly contribute to expression are those wherein character is most clearly discerned in expression they appear more powerful and active as the occasion is recent and obvious but the cause of character being remote and latent it ’ tokens though abiding are not equally strong as the parts of the face will be examined under the article expression few words upon each of them shall suffice here forehead upon which the hair grows very low especially if accompanied with wrinkles is usually sign of gloomy dispo sition very thick eyebrows seem to indicate jealousy and dislike the eyes very much contribute to character when large and fierce they express courage and fury when soft and moderate good-nature but if too small they mark disingenuity and cun ning the nose is the seat of anger and large nostrils may be thought to signify it the nose when turned up betokens sensu ality and when ruddy is well known as ihe sign of drunkard the mouth discovers whether person be churlish or benevolent if the former the under lip has contracted habit of pouting and it ’ corners bend downwards it the latter the corners of the mouth turn rather upwvards as approaching to smile especially when about to speak the cheeks in persons of complacent temper are seldom found hollow and funk in when plump they commonly represent jollity and mirth. '' the form of the nofe says leonardo da vinci may be varied eight different ways exhibiting as many different kinds of noses either uniformly straight concave or convex or concave or convex unequally or ihe parts above straight those below concave or those above straight those below convex or concave above and straight below or above and convex below or convex above and straight below or convex above and concave below the insertion of the nose to the eyebrows admits but two different forms concave or straight the forehead is capable of three dif ferent shapes plain concave or convex the plain is divided seve ral ways either hollow towards the top or towards the bottom or at both top and bottom or it is uniformly plain and even in order to retain the air of any man ’ face whom you chance to see apply yourself to the study and observation of the various faces which present themselves always taking especial notice of those parts which distinguish one man from another and which most contribute to that infinite and amazing variety observable in the species. '' every feature however minute affords something particu lar for observation which being regarded with proper attention will contribute greatly to render the ideas of the student just and permanent it is impossible to say determinately such and such features compose the character of person therefore he is morose glutton because the inclination of the human mind being not to one passion exclusively though one may predominate but com pounded of many desires and containing variety of dispositions often opposite and contradictory fo the signs of those dispositions oppose and contradict each other there is no man whose features exhibit anger or hatred affection or tranquillity alone because he is not constantly angry though often not always tran quil and easy however calm he may be in general but his sen sations being various his aspect presents the marks of that variety hence arises that almost infinite diversity of character which we remark in the human countenance hence the likeness or unlike ness in persons of the same family whose turn of mind being similar or different the family resemblance is varied into the fea tures corresponding therewith natural inclination though active and powerful is not infre quently so controlled and checked by acquired habit as to lay dormant or nearly in action and demeanour if person be choleric he is nevertheless restrained by principle of good breeding and manners from indulging his choler if he be man of sense and wisdom his care in this particular will greatly curb his disposition person naturally gluttonous will it man of decency for decency ’ sake refrain from gross debauchery de corum of behaviour though it can not erase the lines of coun tenance yet should incline an artist to soften them nor represent to posterity as irascible or as glutton him whose deportment is sedate and temperate acquired habit though it can not erase the lines of countenance frequently adds others to them severe and long continued study is apt to occasion solemnity of aspect chiefly seen in the brow which should be carefully distin guished from iil-nature and indeed all professions occafion à certain something in the

not discover taylor at first sight exceptions must be allowed but the principle is just this idea might be pursued in very extended variety of remarks but as attention to nature will confirm the student in it ’ propriety we shall not enlarge upon it here habit arifsng from causes not pro fessional has many ways of shewing itself and contributes not little to character person who has constantly affected superior judgment no matter in what art acquires certain positive and dogmatical air both in his countenance and manner habit makes some hold down their heads others hold them up some stare from habit others squint nature is the only guide upon this sub ject the variety is too copious to be regulated by precept hitherto we have only considered rules of general application it may assist to enlarge the ldeas of the student if we notice some subjects more particularly vain is the attempt were it ever fo lawful to reprefent driry who dwelleth in light inaccessible invisible to men perhaps to to angels the church of rome in permitting such pictures docs equal dishonour to the subject and injury to art which if properly employed may expect to be rewarded with applause but upon designs infinitely beyond it ’ power it ’ utmost ex ertions are frivolous and vain but in the person of jesus christ the restraint is taken off and the human nature of christ is equally with others subject for the pencil not that there is the least reason to suppose his por trait was ever taken or that st. luke is the author of those at tributed to him which are universally painted in so wretched style as to make us hope were they his he succeeded better in his evangelical calling than in that of painter the plates exhibit heads of christ from various masters and histories indeed the same master when treating different facts could not but insert heads of different airs as the subject treated might require yet in he character which the greatest painters have chosen to represent christ there appears resem blance of features because the parts which composed his moral character being permanent his pictursique charaster so to term it of necessity contains such traits as correspond wich it meck ness benevolence compassion mingled with dignity sometimes with fervour never with anger or pride forbid the marks of irregular passions which alas are too universal among mankind to represent him at any period during his life it should be remem bered that he was “ man of sorrows and acquainted with grief but after his resurrection as his sorrows and grief were past his counenance expreffes greater complacency and majesty the apostles should be drawn in style suitable to their apos tolic office and not to their previous prosessions peter as an apostle should have more dignity united to his warmth than is due to him as fisherman as the stations of peter and john are very conspicuous in the history of the gospel they are naturally introduced into most compositions representing events of that history and artists have generally agreed in the character proper to each but to retain as some have done the youthful appearance of jonn when the story related happened in his old age is absurd no excuse can justify fo flagrant violation of propriety moment ’ reflection is sufficient to demonstrate the neces sity of giving to judas iscariot very distinct features from any of the other apostles for although it is evident the disci ples rather suspected themselves than him so fairly did he preserve appearances yet unless the artist is permitted to employ some signs of his baseness he can not possibly distinguish the traitor and thief these subjects are clear and obvious but there are others more obscure and difficult we have authority to suppose st. paul was in person diminutive and inelegant and troubled with disorder most probably nervous or paralytic under these embarrassments what traits shall express the dignity of sentiment the persuasive energy the eloquent pathos of this in spired apostle the plates shew the ideas of raphael and other great masters upon these subjects which are selected as being ge nerally familiar to younger minds profane history affords innumerable instances of diversity of character the heroic alexander the effeminate darius the sublime plato must not resemble each other independent of likeness to their portraits caesar must be distinct from nero and trajan from caligula poetry presents an inexhaustible fund of subjects for the ex ertions of design and as art enjoys the greatest liberty when engaged upon them because creatures of fancy so it is ex pected that fertile imagination and skilful hand should embody as it were the ideas of the poet and present to the eye the similitudes of deities or heroes of nymphs or syl vans with freedom and vigour but if imagination should run riot and attempt to express the subjects treated without strict attention to character what an heterogeneous mixture would it produce “ confusion worse confounded “ would be its proper motto jupiter or apollo cupid or hercules must be known not so much by the thunderbolt or lyre the quiver or the club as by features so expressively coincident with the subject as to preclude doubt achilles and nestor ajax and ulysses must differ as well from each other as from thersites or poly phemus our sublime poet milton has expressed and distinguish ed the characters of the personages in his paradise lost with skill and precision at least equal to any other author homer only can pretend to be his superior as having been in some in stances his original in conformity to the ldea that to repre sent deity is infinitely beyond the narrow limits of human ability milton himself has not attempted it but has chosen to describe the attendant angels “ the chariot of paternal deity “ in the most exalted terms and having thus elevated the mind of his reader leaves him to reason with adam in another instance these are thy glorious works parent of good almighty thine this universal frame thus wondrous fair thyself how wondrous then unspeakable¬ in work which treats of the sister art to poetry it would be unpardonable to pass slightly over poem which does so much honour to our native country and which exhibits such excellent and so various descriptions of characters exalted abased inno cent guilty lovely and hateful the student who enters into the spirit of milton portraits will not only be highly enter tained but greatly improved to speak like painter their co louring and expression is noble in stile grand and sublime and their effect wonderfully well adapted to strike the attentive reader the following is among the most exquisite effusions of poetic imagination its subject is adam and eve in paradise two of far nobler shape erect and tall godlike erect with native honour clad in naked majesty seem lords of all and worthy seem for in their looks divine the image of their glorious maker shone truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure severe but in true filial freedom plac ’ whence true authority in men though both not equal as their sex not equal seem for contemplation

purple vest the glit tering helm the nodding plume of some poets as the real subjects of the poem were in their state of felicity to any of their numerous but degraded issue not that the tokens of station and dignity are in the present slate of things to be des pifed but that the charms of simple and innocent nature are in finitely superior to the splendid pomp of external decoration striking contrad to the description above is the representa tion of saran about to speak in the council at pandemonium where although the subject is allowably as bad as imagination can make it and where alone there is usually thought to be no dan ger of exaggeration yet we have not the devil which vulgar minds would draw but such mixture of feelin gand compassion as expresses “ not less than th ’ archangel ruin '' and which very judiciously heightens the other infernal parts of his character as light is necessary to discern the depth of black itself as when the sun new ris' looks through the horizontal misty air shorn of his beams or from behind the moon in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds on half the nations and with fear of change perplexes monarchs darken so yet shone above them all th ’

and would extend this article beyond its proper limits it is no new idea that the genius necessary to poetry and painting is greatly simi lar of this the subject before us is very confiderable evidence for unless both the poet and painter carefully maintain in their works regular and obvious discrimination of character the beauty and excellence of their performances vanish from these remarks it appears that one mean whereby to attain competent discernment of picturesque character is familiar acquaintance with the works of our best authors whoever with attention to this hint reads those spectators which contain accounts of sir roger de coverley will quick iy perceive the diversity of features necessary to distinguish him from will honeycomb or sir andrew freeport the different nations which inhabit the globe have each something in their appearance peculiar to themselves arising either from climate or custom from religious rites or civil manners independent of that cast of features which each indi vidual possesses and of whatever rank he may sustain in life it is true that among europeans and nations who have conside rable intercourse with each other this variety is not so striking as in people who never mingle with their neighbours because the former become in time not little assimilated to those with whom they have most communication and natives of either country who unite and mix with the other diffuse their distin guishing peculiarity wherever they form connections so like wise persons of rank and fortune seldom present the marks of their nation equally strong with the lower classes of people be cause by acquaintance with foreigners at home or residence among them abroad they acquire much of their manners and deportment while the inferior part of mankind not having the same opportunities but continually conversing among such as resemble themselves preserve the original and popular character of their country national distinctions of feature and manners are so ob vious that little need be said upon them it is useless labour to prove that an englishman does not resemble chinese or frenchman hottentot but it would require very copious dissertation to examine into all the varieties that might be named nor is it easy to procure authentic portraits of remote nations sufficiently correct from which to form judgment what we have been able to obtain appears in the plates what further may occur will be noticed under the miscellaneous observations it may be proper to remark in general that geographers and others who have studied the human species inform us of at least eight varieties found upon the globe diflerent from each other in many respects the laplander whose diminutive fi gure instead of measuring seven and half or eight timees the length of his head admits but from five to six and of conse quence has to us an uncouth and squab appearance who perhaps is as little pleased with what he considers as the too tall and awkward proportions of the southern european the negro has features peculiar to himself so has the the chinese the hottentot so have the indians of north america and those of the south to which varieties may be added that singular people the jews many other national peculiarities might be noticed but it becomes us to consider that this article is as we have ob served very extensive field for investigation which al though it abounds with flowers both fragrant and beautiful yet like all other paths to knowledge is not without many thorns and briars it requires no little dexterity to avoid the latter in whoever wilhes to possess the former this dexterity may be attained in time when ripe judgment and intelligent mind may safely emulate subjects which at present it is prudent to forbear we hinted that the numerous disorders to which the human frame is subject are considerable source of those peculiarities of feature which contribute to character sickly person is readily distinguished from one in health and distempers acute or chronical produce correspondent effects in the coun tenance whether distempers accompany us openly or conceal them selves closely their effect is great but the most powerful agent in changing the features is time to whose irresistible sway all persons and things submit. '' what remains to be said on the different appearances of ages being less pleasing than what has gone before shall be described with brevity in the age from twenty to thirty barring acci dents there appears but little change either in the colour or lines of face for though the bloom tints may go off little yet the features attain fixed firmness which aided by an air of acquired sensibility makes ample amends for that loss and keeps beauty till thirty pretty much upon par after this time as the alterations grow more and more visible we per ceive the sweet simplicity of many rounding parts of the face begin to break into dented shapes with more sudden turns about the muscles occasioned by their many repeated move ments as also by dividing the broad parts and thereby taking off the large sweep of the serpentine lines what further havock time continues to make after the age of fifty is too remarkable to need describing the strokes and cuts he then lays on are plain enough however in spite of all his malice those lineaments that have once been elegant retain their flowing turns even in venerable age leaving to the last comely piece or ruins '' this passage is borrowed from an artist whom we have quoted already such is the close of the most admirable beauty and most elegant features `` this is old age and thus do men outlive their youth their strength their beauty which will change to wither ’ weak and grey `` alas how little from the grave we claim “ we have not noticed the features peculiar to each sex sepa rately because they are too plain to be mistaken and are in both sexes subject to the same rules of particular character the abbe winkelman has remarked and justly that the second childishness of mankind shews itfelf in the assimilation of the sexes in advanced years in infancy they are greatly alike very distinct at maturity and in old age they return to likeness the most beautiful woman retains not the softness of her countenance but as wrinkles increase approaches in appearance to man of the same time of life as man who though ever so robust and athletic loses the distinguish ing characters of his sex and under the pressure of load of years deserted by strength and vigour dwindles into close resemblance to an old woman as we mean not to enlarge this article we shall conclude it by remarking that dress though no essential part of the person is yet an essential part of character the features of the face can not be ehanged but their appendages may be and accordingly have been almost ad infinitum the absence or superfluity of the hair of the beard and of the head the different forms into which it is curled twisted or plaited and the innumerable ornaments to which mankind have recourse for an addition of supposed elegance contribute very much to diversity of character the ruffs and caps of our forefathers would so effectually metamorphofs modern fine gentleman that his most intimate acquaintance would not know him nor is less remarkable the effect produced by the redundant full-bottomed wigs of our great law officers to which if the pendent beard was added when mr. serjeant became judge he might justly defy the acutest brother of the coif to discover him in effect the fea tures of any man who has not very singular cast of counte nance may be so disguised by various forms of dress as scarcely to appear the same the uses of this principle upon the stage are notorious and perhaps in real life its influence is much more frequent and deceptive than is generally imagined we shall here close this subject referring to the remarks upon the plates which accompany it to the miscellaneous obser vations and to similar title when we consider the figure discourse upon expression delivered to the royal academy of painting at paris by mons le brun president gentlemen at our last meeting you were pleased to approve of my defign to discourse upon expression in the first place it is necessary to understand in what it consists expression is in my opinion natural easy and striking resemblance of the subject intended to be represented it is an indispenfable requisite in all parts of painting no picture can be perfect without it by expression is marked the just charac ter of every object it distinguishes the natures of different bodies imparts to figures life and motion and gives apparent reality to what is only delusory it is principle equally neces sary in colouring as in design and should be regarded as well in representations of landscape as in compositions of figures expression is principle which discovers the sensations of the mind and the effects of its various passions nothing can be added to what has been already written by many learned men who have treated upon the passions whose opinions upon this subject should not repeat was it not the better to explain what concerns our art and that it seems necessary to touch upon it for the information of young students first then passion is an emotion of the mind residing in the sensitive part which exerts itself to attain what the mind considers as good and to avoid what it regards as injurious and usually whatever raises passion in the mind produces an action of the body therefore as it is certain the greater part of mental passions produce bodily motions it is necessary we should know what are those motions of the body which express the passions and these we term actions action is nothing but the motion or apparent variation of certain part this variation in the appearance or situation of that part is produced by change made in the muscles the muscles receive motion from the nerves which surround them the nerves act by the spirits contained in the cavity of the brain the brain receives them from the blood which procceeds continually from the heart where it is so heated and rarified as to raise certain subtle vapour which rising to the brain fills it the brain thus filled distributes these spirits to the other parts of the body by means of the nerves which as so many small tubes convey them to the muscles in quantity greater or less as may be requisite for the action to which they are called that muscle therefore which is most exerted receives the great est portion of spirits and in consequence becomes more in flated than the others which are deprived of them and which by that privation are rendered apparently weaker and less con spicuous though the foul be united to all parts of the body yet there are various opinions respecting the place where it more particu larly exercises its functions some maintain that it is fmall gland in the midst of the brain because this part is single whereas all other parts are in pairs and as we have two eyes two cars and all the exterior organs of sense in pairs there must be some place where the two images admitted by the two eyes or the two impressions received from single object by the two organs of any other sense may unite before they arrive at the mind itself in order that they may not present two objects instead of one others say the feat of the mind or foul is in the heart because here the passions are felt my opinion is that the mind receives the impressions of the passions in the brain and feels their effects in the heart the exterior movements which have remarked confirm me greatly in this opinion the ancient philosophers having supposed the mind to possess in its sensorium two distinct appetites place the simple passions in that which is the seat of desire and in that which is the feat of anger the more ferocious passions and those which are com posed of them the first they say contains love hatred desire joy sorrow in the other reside terror courage hope despair anger fear others add admiration which they confider as the first then love hatred desire joy and sorrow from these are derived those passions which are compound such as fear courage hope it will not therefore be improper to say something upon the nature of these passions for our better understanding them before we speak of their exterior movements we shall begin with admiration admiration is surprise which makes the mind attentively consider striking and extraordinary objects this suprise is so forcible that sometimes it impels the spirits towards the part which receives the impression of the object and occupies the mind in considering this impression so strongly that there remains scarce any spirits passing in the muscles but the body becomes motionless as statue excess of admiration produces astonishmnent and astonish ment may take place before we know whether the object is desireable or not insomuch that it should seem that admira tion is united to esteem or to contempt according to the great ness or diminutiveness of an object from esteem arises vene ration from contempt disdain but when any thing is represented as good for us it raises in us love for it when it is considered as evil or hurtful it ex cites in us hatred love is an emotion of the mind caused by sensations which incite it to desire an union to those objects which it supposes desirable hatred is an emotion caused by those sensations which incite the mind to desire separation from objects it supposes hurtful desire is an agitation raised in the mind by its inclination for those things which it imagines to be proper thus not only do we desire the possession of absent but the continuance of present good joy is an agreable emotion of the mind the effect of its en joyment of good supposed to be in its possession sorros is disagreeable languor the effect of uneasiness which the mind feels either from present evil or from the want it suffers of some good compound passions fear is an apprehension of future evil which anticipates calamities that threaten us hope is promising appearance or strong expectation of obtaining what is desired hope when extreme becomes cer tainty as on the contrary extreme fear becomes despair despair is persuasion of the impossibility of obtaining what we desire and deprives us even of what we possess anger is turbulent agitation excited by vexation and cou rage by which the mind retires within itfelf to withdraw from injury received and at the same time rises against the cause of the injury with purposes of revenge there are many other passions which shall not now enume rate but content myself with exhibiting them in the designs but let us previously notice those movements of the blood and spirits which produce simple passions it has been remarked of admiration that it does not cause any change in the heart or in the blood as the other passions do the reason is that neither good nor evil being its object but merely the knowledge of the thing admired it has no concern with the heart or blood upon which depend the functions of the body love when simple that is to say unaccompanied by joy desire or sorrow has an equal pulsation more sensible and stronger than usual pleasant warmth invigorates the breast and digestion is promoted by it in the stomach insomuch that this passion contributes to health of hatred it is remarked that on the contrary the pulse is unequal and weak often quicker than ordinary the breast is afflicted by heats intermingled with sharp and severe inflam mations and the stomach suspends its offices in joy the pulse is equal and quicker than usual but not so strong or sensible as in love not only is an agreeable warmth felt in the breast but diffused over all the exterior parts of the body in sorrow the pulse is seeble and flow the heart feels as if confined by bands and frozen by icicles which communicate their frigidity to the rest of the body desire has this singularity that it agitates the heart more violently than any other passion and furnishes to the brain greater quantity of spirits which passing thence through the muscles quicken every sense and render every part of the body alert have mentioned these internal movements the better to ex plain their connection with the external shall now proceed to observe what parts of the body serve to indicate the passions of the mind to the spectator the mind as we have asserted is united to all parts of the body and may use them to express her sensations fear may be signified by man running in fright anger by man beating another with his fist but if it be true that the mind more immediately exercises its functions in one particular part which is in the brain we may say in like manner that the face is that part where her feelings are most conspicuously exhibited and as we have said that the gland in the midst of the brain is the place where the mind re ceives the images of the passions so that part of the face where the passions shew themselves most distinctly is the eye brow though many have supposed it to be the eye it is true the eye-ball by its fire and motion shews clearly the agitation of the mind but it does not express the nature of that agitation the mouth and the nose have great share in expression but in general these parts only follow the motions of the heart as we shall remark in the sequel of this discourse and as it has been said that in the sensitive part of the mind reside two appetites from whence procced all the passions so in the eye-brow there are two motions which express all their sen sations these two motions coincide perfectly to those two appetites for the elevation of the brow towards the brain is the sign of the passions which are savage and cruel but is yet more remarkable in these motions that in proportion as the passions vary their nature the movement of the brow varies its form for to express simple passion the movement is fimple if it is compound passion the movement is compound if the passion is gentle the movement is gentle if violent so is the movement but it must be remembered that there are two kinds of ele vations of the eye-brow one when it rises the middle and this expresses agreeable sensations when the brow thus rises the corners of the mouth are elevated whercas in expressions of sorrow the mouth is elevated in the middle but when the eye-brow sinks in the middle denoting bodily pain then the mouth sinks at its corners in laughter all the parts follow each other for the brows descend towards the centre of the forehead and make the nose the mouth and the eyes follow the same motion in weeping the movements are compound and contrary for the eye-brows lower themselves on the side of the nose and eyes and on that side the mouth rises there is yet this observation to make that when the heart is dejected so are all parts of the face but on the contrary when the heart feels some passion which inflames and hardens it all the parts of the face follow similar movement parti cularly the mouth which proves as have already said that this part exhibits more especially the sensations of the heat for we must observe that when the heart suffers the corners of the mouth sink when it is satisfied they rise when the heart has aversion to any object the mouth expresses that avertion by rising in the middle and pouting these gentlemen are the remarks we shall make upon the simple outlines which have sketched the better to explain my discourse esteem there is no other way to represent esteem than by the attention and motion of the parts of the face which seem to be fixed to the object which causes this attention for in this passion the eye-brows appear advan ced over the eyes one part approach ing the side of the nose the other somewhat elevated the eye very open and the eye-ball raised the veins and muscles of the forehead and those which are around the eyes seem little inflated the nostrils gently drawn downwards the cheeks rather hol low the mouth little open its cor ners drawn back and bending down wards admiration we have noticed admiration as the first and most temperate of all the passions and which least agitates the heart the face receives very little alteration in general what there is is only in the elevation of the eye-brow but both its sides are equal the eye little more open than ordinary the lids motionless and fixed upon the object of admiration the mouth half open but without any change and all the other parts of the face is usual this passion produced only suspension of motion to give time to the mind for deliberation upon what is to be done and consider attentively the object presented for is it is rare ple extraordinary this first and sim and movement admiration begets esteem additional observations proportion of the parts of the face it is necessary to observe before we proceed to consider the parts of the face that although correct rules and dimensions are useful in their places yet they are not to be implicitly followed upon all occasions it is not easy without them to fix in the mind of the student an abiding idea of regular proportion but that such rules are necessarily very confined appears from the front face in plate ° and the profile in plate viii ° for it is evident that small variation in the situation of the face would deprive the rule of its application it is certain that nature does not in any of her works confine herself to mathematical precision but produces an almost infinite variety of counte nances by enlarging or diminishing the features which compose them so should the designer be careful to avoid constant repetition of the same pro portions left his performances fatigue the spectator by their too great simi larity for since in observation of natural objects the eye is delighted by continual variety is it liable to be satiated when inspecting the imitations of those objects if instead of that variety to which it has been accustomed there is presented to it continual repetition without diversity the parts of the face are too obvious to need division the forehead is usually about one third of the length of the face but is more or less according to the situation of the hair which in some persons is high in others low the eye contains three divisions the ball the iris and the pupil the ball may be considered as about one fifth part of the width of the face their is one third of the length of the ball it is differently coloured in dif ferent persons but not according to any certain rule in general people whose hair and complexion are high coloured have the iris blue or grey and on the contrary those whose hair and complexion are dark have the iris of deep brown for the pupil no determinate proportion can be given for by most admirable contrivance this part possesses the faculty of contracting or dilating itself according to its situation in strong light which might otherwise be offensive its orifice closes so as to admit no more of the rays of light than are convenient in the shade or wherever light is deficien it expands and thereby enjoys much greater portion of light than otherwise it could receive in cats and other animals that prey in the dark the pupil of the eye is so variable as to admit more than an hundred times the quantity of light at one time than at another the human eye admits more than ten times the quantity of light at one time than at ano ther and perhaps the difference may be yet greater in very dark places it is not impossible but that the iris may then be drawn back and the pupil ex pand to the whole surface of the cornea the passions of the mind have considerable influence upon the pupil of the eye it is invigorated and in flamed by some by others it becomes debilitated and languid in what is usually termed large eye it is rather the iris than the ball which is larger than usual in some persons the ball is more prominent in others it is more retired the length of the nose is one third part of the face or one fourth part of the head seen in front its width at the nostrils is equal to the length of the eye and it has the same dimensions in profile the height of the nostril is about one third the width of the nose the mouth admits of great variety of forms its usual extent is about the length of an eye and quarter but for the proportions of the lips scarce any rule can be given they may be thicker or thinner one thick and the other thin in profile the mouth is nearly half the length of the front the upper lip should generally be more prominent than the under but when the under lip exceeds the upper it is reckoned deformity by artists the ears are usually somewhat more than one fourth part of the length of the head in profile about half their height the various positions of the head very much change their appearance in conformity to the foregoing rules plate exhibits six studies of eyes at large plate ii six noses at large plate iii six mouths at large plate iv five ears at large these subjects are given of proper size to be drawn after and as it is of the utmost consequence to be able to copy them well before the student proceeds to the other designs let him repeat them frequently endea vouring at very correct imitation having attained to competent skill in designing the parts the next step is to proceed to unite them in order to attain certain manner of doing this plate presents method of placing the parts in front face according to the following principles draw an oval broader above nar rower below divide it equally by the perpendicular line then by the transverse line divide into five parts in and place the eyes from downwards the half gives the length of the nose and ear from to the chin divide into three parts upon place the mouth the neck ap ears neatly level with the mouth the head is four noses in length to the pit of the neck is another nose these rules are not to be too servilely adhered to but are inserted merely as kind of guide to the beginner till his eye is sufficiently instruc ted to permit him to quit them plate vi shews in two examples the situation of the parts in the oval which forms the head when seen either in profile or three quarters plate vii is study of head at large looking downwards plate viii contains twelve heads in varlous positions which should be copied much larger than the plate ° is front face upon the same principles as plate to design ° form an equilateral triangle upon one of its sides mark the features of the face by dividing it into three equal parts the intersections correspond to the places of the top and bottom or the nose and the angles to the top of the forehead and the chin little prominence forms the forehead chen insert the nose and divide the lower part for the mouth and chin by the proportions of plate the remain ing point of the triangle shews the situation of the ear ° is an appli cation of the same rule to face in profile looking upward if the student has ever attentively inspected globe the principles of the following heads will be readily understood by him or it he will give him self the trouble to draw an horizontal line or two upon any egg-shaped object he will perceive upon furning it the reason of the variations in the lines it is certain the real distances of the features must continue the same in all positions of the head but their apparent situation to the eye of spectator may vary according to their position or to the place of his eye when viewing them numbers are examples of heads looking upward where we observe thas those lines which in ° and were horizontal are now become the superior part of circle and those divisions of the fate which were equal are become unequal the upper appearing to diminish as they recede while the lower preserve their ori ginal dimensions.as che head reclines more and morc backwards the upper parts become less visible till at length the chin nearly conceals the whole face those lines which in nos and were horizontal and in nos the superior part of circle in no which are heads looking downwards become the inferior part of circle and the lower parts of the face are now apparently lessened while the higher parts project and retain their proper size character of the parts of the face plate ix exhibits six different mouths of various characters plates xi contain the parts of the face of apollo measured from the antique they are given not only as the most perfect model of proportion in the face of man but also that they may be compared with the same parts in the face of the venus plates xii xiii which may justly be deemed the most regular female beauty the sculptor ’ design in the apollo being to give the most accurate form united wich the greatest dignity the measures should be collated with the head of antinous plates xiv xv who be ing no deity the artist was intent upon masculine delicacy only in which he has succeeded to admiration the measures of the face of apollo and venus compared eye in front __ in profil __ lid __ the eye-lid to the eye-brow __ of the eye-brow __ of the nostril __ depth of the nostrils __ of the nose __ at nostrils seen underneath __ between the nostrils __ of nose in profile __ of the nostril__ of the mouth in profile __ the top of the under lip to commencement of the chin __ of the mouth in front __ of chin __ student will observe variety of measures besides those compared all of which merit his attention plate xiv contains two heads of the dying gladiator nos head of an egyptian term ° head of the grecian shepherdess ° heads of the venus of medicis ° head of antinous ° nose and mouth of antinous compared with those of fragment supposed to be executed by the same artist and the eyes of the same fragment whose proportions compared with those of the venus and apollo deserve attention plate xv presents two views of the head of the farnese hercules two of antinous two of the fragment by the same hand and two of the pythian apollo in these heads we may remark the following variations antinous apollo fragment hercules proportion of the eyes vide pl the center of the face the neck same in profile and appears from hence that the face of hercules is by no means larger than those of the other subjects but his neck is of great dimensions to give him an appearance of strength the student will observe for himself the difference in the other measures the remaining plates scarcely admit of remarks they contain more finished examples of the progress of the countenance from childhood to maturity and old age and may be arranged in the following order plate xvi studies of boys heads plate xvii childs head old woman head plate xviii old man head young woman ’ head plate xix boy head laughing plate xx extreme old age plate xxi soldiers after mortimer pl xxii boy and dog plates xxiii xxiv xxv refer entirely to the discourse upon expression and are there explained
