the drawing school for little masters andmisses containing the most easy and concise rules for learning to draw without the assistance of teacher emibellistied with great variety of figures curiously defigned to which are added the whole art of kite making the author ’ new discoveries in the preparation of water-colours by master michael angelo london printed for carnan at number st pauls church yard to his royal highness prince edward this drawing school with all due submission and respect humbly inscribed to him as patron of the arts bx his royal highness ’ most obedient and devoted servant michael angelo the preface to the second edition after having perused almost every book hitherto published for the instruc- tion of young people in the art of drawing have found them calculated only for those who were advanced above the period of childhood many of them contain nothing but designs without the least directions how to proceed and even in those that have terms of art and geometrical propor- tions as tend rather to deter youth from the study of this science than encourage them in the purfuit of it there are it is true books of drawings sold at every print shop for six-pence each but if the purchsser expects to find in any one of them all the different parts of the hu- man body he will be much mistaken the first he lays his.hands on may confist of land preface to the scapes the second of birds and in the third he may find leg or an arm and perhaps body complete should he express his desire to have one containing every limb separate he will be told that such an one can not be had under five or six sbillings ihave here attempted with no small share of care and application to form such piece as apprehend will be of singular service to those who wishi to become proficients in draw- ing at very trifling expence and will venture to asfert that whoever shall make themselves perfect masters of what it contains will find no great difficulty in imitating what- ever they may afterwards meet with in much more expensive works have not only given the different parts of the human body but have likewise introduced twelve birds in dif- ferent attitudes and given some directions for the preparation of water-colours the first principles of drawing can not be taught too early and am fully convinced that young children might be brought to tolerable knowledge of it long before that age in which they are generally first put to it children are naturally fond of pictures and second edition it is no uncommon thing to sée them before they are taught how to hold pen drawing houses and steeples dogs and horses was this disposition which seems natural to the generality of children properly en- couraged and made rather matter of amuse- ment than tafk we should probably see many prodigies at seven or eight years of age and time might make them artists equal to those of italy the human figure and particularly the face is the most difficult study but when the young pupil has made himself perfect master of this he will find no great difficulty in any thing else for this reason have given copies of various faces from the moff easy gradually encreasing to those which are difficult would advise such parents as may chuse to put this little work into the hands of their children not to impose these lessons on them as task but merely as an amuse- ment not to treat them with severity if they do not properly attend to them but to encourage them by trifling rewards such as are great in the eyes of children when they make preface make any remarkable improvements tho' they may not understand drawing themselves yet surely there can be but few if any who can not tell when the designs here given are properly imitated have added the whole art of kite mak- ing being induced to give it place here by the manner in which it is written though it is an amusement of children only yet even their amusements should be thought of and though every little artist may think himself perfectly acquainted with this matter yet it is possible on reading this treatise he may change his opinion and find himself totally unacquainted with the essentials of kite-making of this second edition nothing more seems necessary to be said than that we have re- vised the whole and given some new draw- ings instead of those in the former edition drawing school lesson my young pupils must not expect to be come perfect artists in day week or month no science is to be acquired but by time and industry and it would be kind of cowardice in any one to be dis- heartened at the first or second trial merely because they did not succeed in their expec- tations have seen many little folks when pretty drawing has been shewn them ex- press the most eager desire to be able to pro- duce the like which undoubtedly they might in time have done would they have had pa- tience but not being able to arrive at the desired ability on the first trial they have given the whole over as impracticable it is not such pupils want as they will only tend to bring my work into disgrace and deter others from consulting it to you who are my patient little pupils the drawing school now address myself and shall proceed to set you forward in your work and will not leave you till have taught you the true rules of proportion for on this depends the whole beauty of your drawings your first attempt should be to draw hu- man figure for when you can do that per- fectly well you will be able to copy almost any thing but in this you must begin by degrees you must provide vourself with sine pens paper that is ftout and smooth and good black-lead pencils it will be time enough to think of hair pencils india ink and colours when you have made tolerable progress in this art instead of loose paper many make ufe of common copy book such as is generally used for writing in at school and this is preferable to loose paper because the young artist will thereby have an opportunity of preserving all his operations from the beginning and may whenever he pleases compare former attempts with the present and thereby see how much he im- proves his first attempt should be of the easiest kind such as the following for little masters and misses this is mouth and part of nose attempt this-first with your pencil but do not despair if what you do should be hut little like it even after several trials for time and industry will certainly conquer all things be sure strictly to follow this rule never to begin another figure till you can draw the former perfectly well when vou find you can imitate this pretty well with your pencil you may then draw it with your pen comparing your own draw- ing with the copy and not leaving it till you come very near to it this will be sufficient for the first lesson lesson ii if my young pupils have gone throt their first lesson in week think they have made sufficient haste in their progrefs for slow beginning generally makes quick end ing but to proceed as you have now the drawing school learned to draw the mouth and the lower part of the nose it is necessary you should add chin to them otherwise the nose and mouth would be of little use as every young artist well knows however here is chin added to the former nose and mouth little practice will bring you to form this chin very properly as there are no compli- cated strokes therein and thus you will have learned the lower part of face after this you may proceed to the eye to draw the eye properly requires somo time and attention and the young artist must not expect to do it perfectly tull after many trials he must first make the ball of the eye then the curved strong line over it and for little masters and misses and the semicircle under it after that the other lines and shadings above and below it in larger figures the eye will require to be made moch fuller and ornamented with many other shadings but the artist who is once become expert at drawing this will soon find it easy to draw any other that shall fall in his way the ear is no less difficult to draw than the eye and requires equal care and attentior draw the outer part first and do this seyeral times before you attempt to meddlétiwith the inside when you find you can imitafé the outside tolerably well and that after re- peated trials you may then proceed to fi- nish it but do not be in haste to get out of this lesson into new one 'it would be ad- viseable before you proceed any farther to go over again what you have already done lesson iii aving now learned to make the nose mouth eyes and ears the next thing to be attempted is to form face ac- cording to the rules of proportion without sufficient knowledge of which it will be in vain for the young artist to proceed any fur- ther with hopes of applause first draw the oval which must be well proportioned like the above when you have made one to your mind draw line quite across across exactly in the center and another at an equal distance between the former and the chin after this draw line from the top of the oval to the bottom on the center line draw the eyes and little above them place the eyebrows very little above the lower line is the place for the lower ex- tremity of the nose or nostrils below that line is placed the mouth and at the bottom of the oval is made stroke for the chin thus will the eyes nose mouth be placed according to thé rules of proportion when you have thus finished the face you may then draw the ornaments round the head and the two lines at bottom which form the neck and part of the shoulder when you are fully convinced that you can do this properly you may then take one step further and attempt the following this is nothing more than the former more perfectly finished in which the eyes nose and mouth are distinctly represented it will be prudent at first to attempt this only with the black lead pencil as the pupil may then rub out with bit of bread such strokes as appear to him erroneous after he thinks he can draw it tolerably well he may try his skill with his pen but let him remember to draw the lines which are to direct him where to place the eyes nose with his pencil only that he may rub them out when the ink of his drawing is dry and thereby give his head the more graceful appearance when he can do this head to perfection he may congratulate himself on having arrived to some tolerable degree of knowledge in the art lesson iv the young pupil has hitherto been em- ployed in learning to draw the front or full face he must now proceed to draw the face looking sideways which is called pro- file he may first attempt the following very casy one he must begin this at the nose and pro- ceed downwards if he has taken pains in learning the preceding lessons he will find no difficulty in this but may soon proceed to the following this is something more expreffive than the last and consequently requires little more attention here the young student mustob¬ serve that the lower extremity of the nofe is made much different from the last and that the lips appear thicker and accompanied with more strokes all this he must carefully observe and endeavour to imitate them as near as possible as it is undoubtedly necessary for the learner to learn faces in all directions here is one looking the opposite way and not having been used to it he will at first find it à little difficult if he uses himself at first to draw faces in one direction only he will find it à difficult matter to break himself of it and will thereby remain only half an ar- tist but time and practice will make them equally familiar we have already mentioned in what man- ner the learner is to koow in what part of the head he is to place the eyes it may not now be improper to acquaint him how the eyes are to be directed upwards or downwards here the learner will'observe that the eyes are placed higher in the head than be¬ fore directed and that instead of streight curved lines are used which incline upwards my pupils will see by the figure what effect this you perceive is the reverse of tha former the eyes are brought rather lowers than usual and the curved lines incline down- wards which make the figure as though look- ing at something beneath it patience and good deal of practice will in time make these things familiar lesson this lesson will not be very difficult provided the young artist has properly attended to the preceding since they are ra- ther copies to improve him by practice than as containing any thing materially new though they may be necessary in-order to pre- pare him for the difficult tafks which he will meet with in the next lesson this is pretty little bald-pated fellow who has perhaps torn all the hair off his head by running it into busn after some bird ’ nest however be that as it will first draw the outlines observing not to give him less hair than he has and to imitate the few strokes resembling it as nearly as possiuie be careful likewise to observe the form and situation of the ear then proceed to the eyes nose and mouth and carefully finiss the whole it is difficult to say whether this little fel- low ’ head wants combing or whether he is naturally what we call shock-headed it is no matter which but this is certain that the young artist will find this head of hair little more difficuit to imitate than the last he must observe nicely the strokes in every part and be carefal that he does not over- look the ear which seems almost buried in the hair this little gentleman is looking down at something and it is possible that it may be athis book you have already been directed how to give the proper turn to the eye in order to direct the look of the figure down- wards you must likewise observe that this is rather front face than profile though the head is so much inclined one way as to leave only one ear exposed to view you observe that this head is in different situation from either of the other three for here is onlyone eyé seen and that almost obscured by lock of hair he is little sulky looking fellow but never mind that do him all the justice you can in drawing his very likeness do not overlook the small part of the ear which is left open to view and be particularly attentive to the nose mouth and chin lesson vi hope my young pupils have been very at- tentive to the preceding lessons other- wise they will cut but poor figure in this which is by far the most difficult they have yet had and which to execute properly will require all their experience care and at- tention this as well as the two following is an antique in which the different paffions of the mind are expressed it will be adviseable for the young pupil to draw this with his pencil several times before he attempts it with his pen as he will find occasion to remove many of his strokes or at least to amend them let him first begin with the forehead nose mouth chin and eye and by no means attempt to draw any other part of the head till he can imitate these to nicety by mak- ing his features the same as those of the co- py when he can do this perfectly well he may proceed to draw the ear thé hair the neck and shoulders and complete all by ad- ding to it any strokes that may appear to be wanting the young pupil will easily perceive that this is more difficult copy than the former as every feature is much more bold and ex- preffive he must spare neither time nor attention to draw every stroke exact and not pretend to proceed till he can nearly equal the copy let him first draw the eyes nose and mouth and then the side of the face after this he may proceed to the ear then the hair and finisn with the neck as kind of reward to mylittle artè for the pains he has taken in the twe preced ing drawings have heig given ifim ver pretty head of nun whichtiie will not find so difficult as the former perhaps were led him begin first with the face then draw the veil and finisn with the neck it will be well worth the pupil ’ while to continue som time in this lesson for when he can drau these three heads to perfection he may then poast of having acquired no small skill in the useful and diverting science of drawing and every thing that follows will become pleasure rather than toil lesson vii aving giyen the necessary instruc- tions and examples for drawing heads and faces we shall now proceed to the arme and hands which the voung pupil will not find very difficult as the position of the hands and arms are frequently very different and more difficult in some positions than in others shall here give few copies of some particular ones which are perhaps all that need to be done on this head here the hand is resting on the edge df something by which means you see only the thumb the fore-finger and the second bent the rest being concealed from the view- be careful to imitate the arm as well as thei hand as nearly as possible the fore-finger is here represented al pointing to or counting out money on ta¬ bie the fore-finger and the thumb only are seen because the other fingers are sup- posed to be bent into the palm of the hand begin this and the former figure at the topsa of the arm and proceed downwards to the extremities of the fingers here the back of the hand is turned to- wards you the second finger is supposed to be holding something between that and the thumb consequently according to nature the third finger must be à little bent and the first and little finger be extended the hand is here extended and the third finger is bent downwards for some particular purpose be careful to observe that this si- tuation of the hand makes material altera- tion in the lines of the arm here the hand is represented as holding or ball in this position you shew only the thumb the finger supporting the other side of the globe this hand is grasping staff and it is probable that the young pupil will find it more difficult to imitate than either of the others in this lesson however there is no- thing in it to despair of since little care and attention will soon accomplish it lesson viii from the hands and arms we shall now proceed to the body and in the next lesson shall conclude the parts of the human figure with the legs and feet out either head or arms but this will be no great loss as by this time you can make her very pretty head and give her hands and arms in what position you like you must begin this at the neck and shoulders then proceed downwards and at last finish it by drawing around it the loose slowing gar- ment as this is the only body shall troa¬ ble my young pupils with hope they will not be in too much haste to pass it over hut give it all the attention it requires and not quit it till they can draw it to the utmost ex- actness the different positions in which the human body may be placed are so various that they can by no means find place in so concise and circumfcribed work as this nor indeed is it neceslary since the little artist if he makes himself perfectly master of the contents of this small volume will be able to take off almost any figure that shall fall in his way at the first or second trial lesson ix we come now to the last part of the human figure the thigh knee lég and foot in the execution of which the student will sind no great difficulty this is thigh knee and part of leg which fs so plain and easy as to require no particular direction when he finds he can do this perfectly well he may proceed to the foot this foot is cut off at that part of the leg where it fhould join to the preceding so that if the young student joins them together he will then have the limb complete as the legs and feet like the arms and the body may be placed in different positions the young artist must observe that he views this foot sideways and let him be very carefol in imitating the lines which form the upper ’ art of the foot the heel and particularly the toes this is right foot placed in different form to the preceding the toes being rather contracted than extended to give the various positions of the foot would be endless and in some degree im possible even the large st works have not at- tempted it and can not however shall not quit this lesson with out giving one more curious example this is the leg and foot of an angel being on wing with the back part of the leg and foot turned to the view the spectator there are many other poss tions of this limb as have just observed but these are sufficient for the prefent purposed lesson having now taught the young pupil how to draw the different parts of the human body it is necessary he should know how to put them properly together which can be learned only from practice the fol- lowing figure may perhaps take him up lit¬ tle time and that something more than he first expected to imitate exactly but let him not be disheartened nor give over till he conquers in the appendix the youag pupil will see the use of the line which runs from the head to the foot of this figure as well as of the numbers and the lines which inclose them on his first attempts would advise him to pay no regard to them but to let them alone till he thinks he is able to proceed further when he can draw this figure perfectly well and has attended properly to what has been advanced in the course of these ten les- fons may venture to apprehend he will not think much of the trifling expence of thia little volume which has taught him so much without the assistance of master whose premium is generally very extravagant but let me not forget my fair pupils who are per- haps under more obligations to me than the young ’ gentlemen who having other stu- dies of more laborious nature to pursue have not so much time as young ladies to amuse themselves in this delightful field of pleasure when speak of young ladies as wishing them to employ small portion of that time which they throw away at the toilette and the glafs to the more rational amusements of drawings may perhaps fall under the censure of some little female who before she can well speak plain is taught to rail against every thing but the invention of some new cosmetic or the discovery of some delicate paint which can not be disco- vered from nature itself.-alasl it is to the false mode of education and not to the fair sex sex themselves that they are so much ex- posed to the just censures of the sensible and judicious part of mankind appendix as apprehend may with some degree of reason suppose that my young pupils have by this time acquired know- ledge of the art of drawing superior to some who have studied it in schools for much children but give them hort abstract of ghe ingenious mr. russel ’ elements as far as gentleman wrote for the instruction of pupils of more advanced age as is evident from his recommendation of the study of ana- tomy in order to enable the artist to imitate every muscle of the human body with more accuracy my design is to entice children to the practice of drawing at an age before any such thing is generally thought of and to make this not so much matter of com palsion as of amusement after thus fairly acknowledging my intentions am confident that the ingenious author of the elements will not accuse me of any unfair or illiberal freedom taken with his valuable produc- tion some artists reject the use of drawings or prints for the student ’ imitation. `` it is say they servile method of proceeding because it cramps the ideas and hence genins suffers too great confinement notwithstanding this the usual practice is to copy after prints and drawings at first and imagine experience has determined the ad¬ vantages accruing from this method to set the drawings of the most eminent artists before young beginner at his first commencement must be highly beneficial as it undoubtedly will prevent that rude- ness and inaccuracy against which the most exact can not be too much guarded how much more then ought the young student to observe this caution some geniuses require restriction and when this happens to be the case the placing of accurate works before them must hold them in kind of subjection from which alone correctness is tobe expect- ed exact copies are absolutely necessary at first this will imperceptibly produce ha- bit of correctness till by degrees the stu- dent will make himself master of those grand essentials to perfections truth boldness and freedom truth will be acquired by this accustomed correctness boldness and freedom will fol¬ low after as the certain consequence and on these the excellence of the performance muft depend copying the drawing of good masters has also another considerable advantage which is teaching good method of execution whereby many laborious and fruitless efforts will be prevented the young student should always have it in remembrance that his chief aim ought to be the making of cor- rect drawing and of attaining truth of outline since this is more effentially neceffa- ry than smartness of touch or pleasing execution when the young pupil has made himself master of good degree of exactness by copying after prints or drawings let him be provided provided with some good head cast after the antique and this should be one in which the features are strongly marked and boldly determined such as the hercules jupiter or niobe as he will find the-strength of either of these more easy of imitation than the refinement and delicacy of the antinous or venus of medicis though the latter after time will be his favourite and most valua- ble study the nose being the center most artists begin their particular shapes with that fea- ture and from thence proceed to the eyes and mouth but let the student sketch the outlines very lightly that any mistake may the more easily be altered his greatest at- tention must be paid to the producing his drawing correct and the lines of the fea- tures parallel to one another and each at proper distance if the students fails here all his labour in the finishing will be to no purpose when he has made himself master of the knowledge of the face he may proceed to the whole figure studying with much assi- duity the casts after the antique those al- most perfect standards of grace majesty and beauty rules in tlie opinion of some people are the fetters of genius but great man very sa judicioussy observed lately that et they are fetters only to men of no genius ’ which is undoubtedly true for when they are pro¬ perly used by men of abilities they affist genius and not impede it on this account shall proceed to give the meafures of fine- ly proportioned human figure with which it is necessary the student should make him- self acquainted previous to his studies after the life the best way to measure the human figure is by faces ten of which from the lowest hairs on the forehead to the bottom of the chin is the best proportioned height the face is divided into three equal parts ist the forehead zd the nose and the mouth and chin from the chin to the collar bones is twice the length of the nose from the collar bones to the lowest part of the breast the length of the whole face from the bottom of the breast to the navel one face and half nose from the navel to the secrets one face from the secrets to the knee-pan two faces from the knee- pan to the ancle two faces from the an¬ cle to the sole of the foot nose and half when the arms are extended hori¬ zontally their length from the extremity of the longest finger on one hand to the other should measure the same as the height of the figure from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot from the shoulder to the elbow the length of two faces from the root of the little finger to the elbow two faces from the box of the shoulder blade to the pit of the collar one face the foot is the lixth part of man ’ height and the hand should measure as much in length as the face the thumb is third part of face in length the shoulder that the face is most turned over is raised higher than the other the shoulder bearing heavy burthen will be raised considerably higher than the other the hip on which the body chiefly rests will likewise be raised higher than the other very easy method of drawing any pic- ture is to cover it with squares in the follow- ing manner when you have thus squared your copy do the same by the paper on which you intend to imitate the figure but for this purpose use only the black-lead pencil observing to make the squares in both exactly the same in number and dimension with your pen then draw the same lines in each square on your paper as vou find in your copy when finished rub out the black-lead lines with piece of bread and your drawing will ap- pear in the greatest perfection if you are de- firous of making your drawing less than the original you have nothing more to do than to make your squarès on your paper às small as you would have them but to observe to make them the same in number as you will here see shall here only add the figures of twelve birds in different attitudes which tho ’ not difficult if the pupil has properly attended to his former-lessons may afford some mat- ter of improvement as well as amusement if the young pupil is defirous of imitating nature throughout her various productions he may consult dr. brooke natural history in which he will find very curious collec- tion of beasts birds fisnes insects exe- ecuted in masterly manner of the preparation of colours before any young artist attempts to colour either his drawings or stars it will be absolutely necessary he should have some idea of the nature and properties of colours that he may know how to prepare them after depriving myself of whole month ’ holidays which other boys would have spent in idleness or play am enabled to give the youthful and industruous artist some valuable directions to this month ’ labour have added my own observations as they occurred to me in the progress of my colouring some hundred of stars and pic tures in those leisure hours which school always affords the youth who is ambitious to excel the first thing to be considered is gum- water to make which take an ounce of of the preparation the whitest gum arabic and half an ounce of clear white sugar candy dissolve these in quart of water and add to it if you think proper little coloquintida the use of this last ingredient is only to keep the flies from spoiling vour work if it should be exposed abroad in the air for where this is used flies will not come near it when your gum-water is thus prepared pass it through fine sieve or à piece of muslin and keep it in bottle so stopped that no à dirt may get in pour but little of it ont at time when you want to use it for should it get dirty or foul it would spoil the brightness of your colours alum-water is useful article for with this you may wasn the drawings or stars you intend to paint which will so six the pa¬ per that the colours will not sink in when you lay them on but will rather tend to brighten them it is made in the following manner boil four ounces of alum in quart of rain or river water till the alum is dissolved and let it stand twenty-four hours after which strain it off for use it proper here to remind you that if your paper paper is very thin and loose let it be washied with the above water four or five times ob- serving to let it dry every time and that it be perfectly so before you attempt to lay any of your colours upon it let us now proceed to enquire into the na- ture of the various colours used in painting of stars and drawings as to white have already observed that it is by no means to be left in stars intended for kites as every por- tion should be silled up with some other co- lour than that of which the general body is composed and in drawings where it is sometimes necessary the colour of the paper will always answer the end especially if it is well glazed without any other assistance of yellows the first of this kind is straw colour and is made of flour of brimstone which of itfelf is sine enough to mix with gum- water yellow cker will make another good pale yellow but in illuminating of prints it is colour of rather too much bo- dy to be used for that purpose anlefs it is well ground with gum water for deep yellow dutch pink is generally used as is english pink for lighter shade with re- spect to colouring of stars gamboge is al- ways to be preferred as it is most beautiful colour and of strong body of reds the best colour of this class for painting of stars is vermilion but this is too heavy to be used on drawings or prints crimson is represented by carmine but great cau- tion should be used in buying it which should never be done by candle-light as it will then be impossible to discover what is truly of the right colour there being great deal of it of so different shade from the real crimson as to be worth nothing transparent pur- lour as shall appear necessary for painting different prints or drawings may be made in the following manner take pint of stale beer in which boil one pint of rasped brazil wood and half an ounce of cam- peachy or logwood till the liquor is height- ened to the colour you desire which you must try by dipping piece of paper into it ff you then find it too red add quarter of an ounce of logwood to the brazil wood and you will find it musch nearer to the pur- ple than the former in like manner ’ you may humour any degree of purple as you put more or less logwood to the former com- pofition after which six the colour with little alum this will produce such clear purples as no mixtures of solid reds and blues possibly can though purples are fre- queatly made by uniting those two colours of blues the first and best bright blue we have is uitramarine which gives spirit to all paintings in which it is used but the price of it is so high that it is never used for stars and seldom even in many of the best prints prussian blue is the next in beauty to uitra- marine but it will not long retain its colour when mixed with gum water and therefore improper for our purpose the next colour to the former for brightness is that which we call blue bise which though it is colour of body will flow pretty well in the pencil if it be well washed which must be done in the following manner put three or four- ounces of it into quart of rain water then stir it and pour off the water imme- diately let it settle to the bottom of every cup or glass you pour it into after which pour off the water and in day ’ time you will have the colour dry and as fine as you can wish indigo makes fine blae when it is ground and washed with gum-wa- ter by means of stone and mullet if you use it for stars you can not have it too strong but mean not fo strong as to prevent it running freely from the pencil and lying smooth on the paper without appearing in lumps if you use it for the colouring of prints you may lighten or darken it to your mind by ufing greater or less quantity of gum-water therewith but before you touch your drawing or print with it try its strength upon white dutch tile for it runs freely in the pencil and may be too strong for your design which you should always be aware of when flowing colour is to be laid ower the dark shade of print as it will mach aggravate its blackness and even make it appear quite black of black have already observed that black is by no means to be admitted among the colours for the use of stars fhall therefore only speak of it for the purpose of prints in even oussy admitted it being so heavy colour as to hide the beautiful strokes of the engraver unless done with great care am here speaking of what they call lvory black which must be pure and well ground many prefer strong tincture of good indian ink while others make use of lvory black prepared in the following manner let your burnt lvory be well ground in gum-water and then beat the white of an egg very well till you sind kind of oily liquor settles to the bot- tom mix the liquor with as much of the extraordinary gloss if the object is shin- ing such as the wings of some beetles mix some of it with little white upon dutch glazed tile till you find it light enough to relieve the shade then make another lighter shade which being used on the brighter part of the subject will produce the effect you desire of greens greens are by all allowed to depend apon the yellow and the blue and by the help of the one or the other colour may be form- ed any green we please the gamboge is one of our first vellows which with the pres paration of verdigrease may be made to produce five or six sorts of greens according as the gamboge abounds or is less in quan tity.. if the gamboge abounds it will form tolerable oak green and being ftill mons mixed with the verdigrease green it will form grass green as for the verdigmase itself it produces fine blueisn green flows easily in the pencil and may even serve as an ink to write with as the method of pre- paring this colour is not much known to the generality of young artists fhall here in¬ form them in what manner it is to be done take three ounces of common verdi- grease break it à little and boil it gently in pint of white wine vinegar observing to stir it continually when you perceive it to boil add iittie tartar-broken and keep your mixture stirring till you find the clear liquor of such colour as you would wishi that is of fine transparent green with blue cast the state of the colour may be known by dipping in stick and touching piece of paper with it when you have colour to your mind pour it through linen cloth into an open vessel and set it to cool when it is quite cold keepit in close vessel for use pour- ing out à little at atime as you want it for when it is expoled to the air it will soon dry but is reducible again by common water when you prepare this liquid colour do not use the distilled verdigrease for it will not answer the end you propose take care you make it strong enough for it is not to be strengthened afterwards without the trou- ble of boiling afresh though it may at any time be made as faint as you please by add- ing common water thereto sap-green is colour like that of an oak leaf if it be used thin with common water for this as well as the former wants no gum however if it is used strong it pro¬ duces very dark green you may try your colour first on white dutchtile and by thinning it with water reduce it as you please but you may brighten it very much by adding to it little of the liquid verdi- grease sap-green is made in the following man¬ ner take the flowers of the blue flag lris or flower-de-luce and press them while thert is any juice to be got from them boil this juice in glazed pipkin till it grows thick adding little alum to it when it will make very useful and lasting green remember in the boiling of any juice in order to make colours to uie an earthen glazed pipkin for if you boil them in vessels of metal you will sometimes be much disappointed in your expectations there is another method of prodacing which is gained by taking the uice of buckhorn berries and though that juice simply will yield only dark pur- ple of very base hue yet by adding tar- tar to it it will turn to good sap-green and may be brought to good consistence by boiling these are the principal discoveries have made in the preparation of colours and which as before observed have deprived me of the sportive enjoyments of many holiday however it may be necessary here to observe that would not advise those young artists who make use of colours on- ly for stars or now and then to ornament print or drawing to be at the trouble and expence of preparing their own colours since it will be much cheaper for them to buv them in shells at the colour shops which are fit for immediate use with the assistance of their own gum-water only defign these instructions only for those who dip deeply into the science and who can not be contented with superficial knowledge of any to every one these cautions seem to be necessary take care to have as many pencil brushies as colours if you intend to be nice and always observe to wash the colours well out of them by dipping them in water and squeezing them well with-your fingers till no colour is seen to proceed from them before you lay them buy after use otherwise they will get hard and be no longer serviceable do not presume to offer this to young artists as complete treatise comprehend- ing every thing that can be said on the sab- ject bat thus much will venture to say if they follow the directions here given they may possibly find it more useful to them be- ing both concise and cheap and collected from natural experiments than many ochen books of ten times the price conclusion efore take leave of my little pupils ishall lay before them few passages of history from which they may form designs for capital pieces of drawings if my little disciples should be at loss how to plan picture from these authenticated scrapes it will be no wonder but after they have gone through this work with assiduity and patience and imitated such historical draw- ings as may have fallen into their hands they will then find this to be no difficult rather pleasing task and have with the more pleasure embraced this opportunity as no¬ thing of the kind has ever yet appeared in the most extensive works of this nature in the mean time they may read them perhaps to advantage merely as matters of enter- tainment and improvement the athenians being at war with the peloponnefians the oracle had promised the victory to the athenians if their king should peloponnesian the fall by the hand of enemy being informed what the oracle had declared gave general charge to their sol¬ diers not to kill codrus who was then king of the atbenians codrus however one even- ing advanced beyond the trenches in the ha- bit of wood gatherer and began to cut several boughs some peloponnefiaas hap- pening to be engaged in the same office met him coming immediately to blows he wounded several of them with his bill but being overpowered he fell under their strokes the prophecy being thus fulfilled the atbeaians inspired with additional strength and courage marched to battle without he¬ fitation and sent herald to demand the bo- dy of their king the peloponnefians un- derstanding what had happened fled and the victorious atbenians decreed heroic ho- nours to the memory of codrus who had vo- luntarily facrificed his life for the good of his country in order to design this picture as well as the following in proper manner would advise the artist not to confine himself too much in the size of his paper and never make it less than quarter of sheet to draw historical pieces in miniature is the work only of an experienced artist this design should consist of codrus engaging the wood-cutters and sinking under their blows the most difficult matter here will be to re- present the natural attitude of the body in such circumstances for this purpose let two of his intimates make sham fight but take care they do not fight in earnest and from them copy the desired position when the principal figures are finished he may then draw the representation of wood and embellisn it with beasts birds aristides and themistocles differing wide- ly in their political principles were violent enemies enemies upon the invanon of the perfians taking hold of each other and going out of the city they put down their hands with their fingers twisted together into one place and at once cried out et here we lay down ee our enmity till we finisn the war against ee the perfians having thus spoken they took up their hands again and untwisted their fingers as if something had been there deposited then silling up the pit they re- turned to the city and continued in har- mony during the whole war this unani- mity of the generals chiefly contributed to the overthrow of the enemy great care must here be taken in repre- senting the stooping posture of the two ge- nerals to preserve the due proportions of nature in such posture requires great care skill and judgment polemon the atbenian was very de- bauched young man one day agreeable to resolution he had before taken having intoxicated hiinself with much liquor he crowned his head with flowers and then staggered into the school of the philosopher yenocratus who was then arguing in defence of temperance the more the unthinking youth endeavoured to interrapt his discourse the more strenuoussy the philosopher pursued it till at last polemon being obliged to hear it became so sensible of his error that from that moment he began to reform and made firm resolution to live better for the future he succeeded so well in his endeavours that in little time he became the first disciple of xenocratus whom he afterwards succeeded the principal figure here is that of drunken man crowned with flowers the face should be in full front that you may give him such silly countenance as is pecu- liar to people much intoxicated with liquor his disordered dress and tottering position should be expressive of his situation the other parts of the design contain nothing difficult philip king of macedon falling to the ground by accident and seeing the extent of his body marked in the dust cried out ee good gods what little space does ee man fill in this universe is nothing very difficult in this de¬ sign take care however that you place the king in proper attitude and fill his face with surprise mind that the sun is placed in such part of the piece as may cast the shadow properly which last can not be done to nicety without much care and attention ptolemeus the théban was so accus- tomed to send no one away empty-handed that came to afk his charity that when poor soldier in distress came to implore his assistance the general having nothing else to give pulled off- his shoes and presented them to the distressed man saying ee my ee friend take these and make the moft you ce can of them for would rather go bare- ee footed than you should starve little need be said on this design in the countenance of the soldier while he is re- ceiving the shoes from the general must be painted sorrow and distress while the looks of the general must be expressive of benevo- lence and humanity after the bloody battle of pedewardin which the germans gained over the turks among the prisoners was janissary who much lamented the loss of his turban the german german soldier who had picked it up hap- pened to be near him and hearing him ex- press his hopeless wishies to have it restored very generously returned it to him at the same time thus addressed him in the turkisn languagez ee you are soldier and so am ee we ought to treat each other as bro- et thers the janissary full of joy at this unexpected mark of generosity and being unwilling to shew less marks of grandeur of soul received the turban with one hand and with the other presented his musket to the german saying es lf we are brothers « have no need of this instrument of death ee which but little while fince was employ¬ cé ed against my enemies and might have been fatal to you the young artist will here be at no loss to find matter to cover his paper men in arms turks and germans may fill every part of it but the center in which must be represented the turk receiving his turban from the german with one hand and surren- dering his arms with the other take care to infuse into their countenances the different passions arising froi their different situations brutus and cassius after having made some conquests met at sardis where they agreed to march against anthony and young caesar here one evening brutus as he was sitting pensive and revolving the trans- actions of his life the memory of caesar occurred to him now perhaps not as trai- tor tyrant or usurper but as one he loved and murdered an apparition appeared to him as he imagined which told him he was his evil genius and would meet him at pbilippi to which brutus calmly answered ° will meet thee there here is copious field in which the young artist may exert every power of his genius brutus and the apparition afford two capital figures brutus must be drawn reclining on couch half raised leaning on one hand with the other lifted up in surprise the most difficult part of the work will be to sill his face with that horror which the artist himself would be supposed naturally to repre- sent in the same sitaation if he has seen the tragedy of hamlet in which the ghost ad- dresses the young prince let him take that for his pattern on this occasion or rather let him imitate some good drawing of this kind pyrrbus king of epirus after being defeated by the romans retired to tarentum and was slain at argos city of greece by large stone thrown on his head from son he was on the point of killing in the attack this will form very pretty pictare and fill up every part of the paper the repre- sentation of castle may be made to cover one half of it under the castle must be drawn the figure of pyrrbus clad in ar- mour and sinking under the blow of fall- ing stone on his head near him the fi- gure of warlike youth with whom he is supposed to have been fighting and who- stands astonished at the sudden fate of pyr- rhus over the countenance of the king must be thrown the appearance of insensibili¬ ty arising from the blow he is supposed to have received but an air of majesty and dig- nity should he preserved on the top of the castle directly over the head of pyrrhus you must place the figure of woman in an an attitude that will shew it was from her hand the stone fell and in whose counte- nance you may perceive the different paffions of joy and terror the rest of the ground may be occupied by the efforts of contending soldiers but take care you do not incumber the living by placing too many dead men at their feet let not the more aged and experienced reader imagine that am not aware of the objections that will be made to my conclu- si et that it is infinitely above the capa- cities of children and therein differing from the former part of my plan to such shall be sport in my answer the genius and capacities of children are seldom put to the stretch and if they in due time per- form the usual tasks imposed on them at school nothing more is required of them but if you hit upon the mode of making them consider as an amusement what you re- gard as an essential 'point wonders may be often produced here genius will have its full scope unfettered of the tedious rules laid down by some self-interested teachers and among thousand of my infant readers should be instrumental in producing only ten artists ishall be satisfied that my labour has not been in vain it is by no means to be expected that the most expert among them should give all that expression have here re- commended to the different faces in the pre- ceding hints fof designs but let even the dullest of my little pupils remember this fure certain and infallible rule that there is no- thing in human life however impracticable it may at first view appear that may not be foreed to give way to uxwearied diligence ap- plication and resolution
