the artist vade mecum being the whole art of drawing taught in new work elegantly engraved on one hundred folio copper plates containing great variety of examples in every branch of that noble art parts of the face heads hands feet academy antiques groupes of figures beasts birds insects flowers fruit shells ornaments build- ings landscapes collected from the works of the greatest masters to which is prefixed an essay on drawing with introducrory rules for the use of learners in which the first principles of that useful and noble art are explained in such manner that it may be attained in short time without master london printed and published according to act of parliament and sold by sayer at the golden-buck in fleet-street mdcclxii the art of drawing drawing is the art of representing by lines and shades the figure of any thing seen in nature or whatever form we conceive in idea it is the noblest operation of human ingenuity and may certainly be reckoned among the qualifica- tions which are the characteristic of gentieman the study of it ought to be encouraged in every youth whatever station of life he may be placed in for besides it ’ great use to all persons concerned in the way of art it must be extremely agreeable to gentleman to sketch fine building beautiful prospect piece of art or uncommon appearance in nature besides drawing enables us to see things in plainer and clearer manner and remember their form shape and other circumstances much better than can possibly be done without knowledge in this art in all ages it has been carefully cultivated by the most polite nations and the great men who have excelled in it have been honoured by the protection of those kings and prin- ces who had taste for the liberal arts it sets before us the most magnificent buildings the most delightful gardens the beauties of art or the productions of nature in so strong and just light that one might imagine one ’ self on the spot and this in language understood by all mankind the implements for drawing are smooth-grained charcoal black-lead pencils red black and white chalk porte-crayon hair pencils crow-quill pens indian ink ruler and pair of compasses- charcoal is proper to fketch with as any strokes made with it may be brushed out with feather if wrong and the black lead pencil gives the correct qut-line red chalk is proper to draw large or academy figures with and black chalk the same especially on colour ’ paper where the lights put in with white chalk has beautiful effect. -- lt is best to begin drawing from some of the least complex examples as they are placed in this collection every thing should be drawn at first with strokes just visible and afterwards corrected by altering what is amiss made as like the original as possible in this manner à learner should draw the several features in different positions well before he attempts an entire head or face for he can not do the whole together until he is master of the parts this done draw faces and heads from some in qut-lines only sketch the qut-line and sinish from the same shaded before proceed in this particular will here give the most approved pro- portions of face and head and the better to understand ity shall describe one viewed in front in which position it ’ qut- line makes nearly the shape of an egg divided by lines as in the examples the upper division for the hair then to the topx and next to the bottom of the nose the lower one to the chin this last part is subdivided equally into three the uppermost is the distance between the nose and mouth the breadth is di- vided into five equal parts of which one is the eye anothen the distance between the eyes from the qutside of the eye to the side of the face is another part the mouth is little more than one the nose little less the eye in front is divided into- three one of which is the pupil or sight the ear is the length of the nose one of the greatest beauties in drawing face and which is absolutely necessary to it is to place the features truly in their places that is the middle of the forehead the nose and the mouth exactly under one another in line and the eyes on line properly crossing that on which the forehead nose and mouth are placed lf you would see how these lines curve in the several attitudes the head may be put into there is very ingenious method of doing it by getting ’ icce of box or other smooth-grained wood turned in the shape of an egg make streight line on this piece of wood from the middle of the top to the middle of the bottom then make crofs strokes on it at the the proper distances as before directed in speaking of the pro- portions of the head fof the eyes nose and by setting this piece of wood in variety of different attitudes you will soe how the lines curve on those occasions and according to those curves you must place and turn the several features by this means think you will easily understand this rule for placing the features properly which is one of the most difficult points and at the same time so absolutely necessary that it is imposii- ble to do any head well without it and next proceed to hands feet and for due proportions of which see the examples after you draw these parts well and with ease try an entire figure of which shall here give you the most approved mea- sures and proportions-the antients commonly allowed eight heads to their figures but we ordinarily divide the figures into- ten faces that is to say from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot viz from the crown to the forehead one third of face the face begins at the root of the lowest hairs upon the forehcad and ends at the bottom of the chin-— the face is divided into three proportionable parts the first contains the forehead the second the nose and the third the mouth and the chin thence to the pit betwixt the collar-bones two lengths of nose to the bottom of the breasts one face to the navel ane face to the genitories one face to the upper part of the knee two faces the knee contains half face to the ankle two faces to the sole of the foot half face man arms stretched out is from the longest singer of his right hand to that of his left as broad as he is long from one side of the breasts to the other two faces the bone of the arm called humerus is two faces from shoulder to elbow thence to the roôt of the little-finger the bone called cubitus with part of the hand contains two faces from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the col- lar-bones one face the sole of the foot is the sixth part of the figure the hand is the length of face the thumb nose those measures are general but liable to exceptions varying varying from the quality of persons and movement of the mus- cles be careful to make just symmetry and harmonious cor- respondence in the whole figure not one leg or arm bigger or longer than the other not the shrivelled face of old age with the plump lips of youth the body of bacchus with the limbs of an apollo or the shoulders of an hercules with the aist of fribble it is proper here to take notice of how great advantage to person who would draw human fi- gure well it is to understand something of the anatomy of it mean so much of it as relates to the bones and the muscles and as appears externally more than this would be to him mere matter of curiosity but thus much is worth the pains of every one to become master of who is ambi- tious of knowing the foundation of the art for it will be means of giving grace strength and beauty to his figures and he will be able to express the proper parts of the limbs which principally operate in every action not blindly and by chance but with truth and certainty which is esteemed by every one who is best able to judge one of the greatest beau- ties in figure there is proper work for this purpose en- nidle compendious treatise of anatomy adapted to the arts of painting and design in which so much only as is necessary to the painter with concise explanation of it is collected to- gether from the more minute parts which are necessary to the surgeon or anatomist sold by sayer at the golden- buck in fleet-street in drapery cloath your figure properly and elegantly and neither with some moderns by massy folds lose sight of your original intention nor by servilely copying the ancients imi- tate wet linen and it will be great help to proportion if whatever is intended for cloathing be sketched naked of which preserve as much as possible yet carefully avoiding the above extremes next in course tho first in art is the expression of the se- yeral passions of the soul which is the most difficult and beau- tiful parts of this art le brun who has treated this sub- ject with great success says that passion is motion of the- soul which makes it follow what it thinks good and fly from that which it thinks hurtful and what causes any passion in the soul produces particular actions in the body in the face it more particularly shews what it feels which for that reason is called the mirror of the soul the most capital subjects extant ofthis- kind are le brun expressions of the passions of the soul where the principal passions are beautifully expressed by that great master in heads almost as large as the life with an ab- stract of his discourse on each of them these heads besides- their usefulnefs in this particular are likewise some of the best- examples to draw after either in red or black chalk that are- to be met with sold by sayer at the golden buck in fleet- street the qut-line conquered our advice touching eight andi shadow might almost be spared so shall only say in the examples before you cover not the light too much at first for that will throw gloom over your drawing and can not easily be effaced on the contrary if your lights are too open your may advance on them with shade at pleasure in composition- so dispose your objects that both light and shade may fall in mass and be careful that your principal be placed to advan- tage when you copy nature the noblest school for art ob- serve the operation of light which considered and observed- from its fountain will alone instruct being unerring in it ’ pro- grefs and rendering the beings most conspicuous nearest-to our- view thus far relates to the human figure and it ’ immediate apa pendages which are the most difficult and important subjects of this art there are however other parts which merit the re -- gard of the learner the drawing flowers fruits birds beasts and the like might be the subject of some of your firsti attempts not only as it is more pleasing employment -but as- it is an easier task than the drawing of faces hands feet and other- other parts of the human body which require not only more care but greater exactness and more judgment there are but sew particular rules for your instruction on this head you have variety of examples in this collection which copy with great care and exactness and be sure to make correct qut- line before you begin to shade drawing of landscapes build- ings for gentleman is the most entertaining and useful in the whole art to be able on the spot as is before observed to take the sketch of fine building or beautiful prospect of any curious production of art or uncommon appearance in nature or whatever else may present itself to view on our jour- nies or travels in our own or foreign countries may-be thus brought home and preserved for our future use either in busi- ness or conversation and is the best method of bringing to mind again those beauties that have once charmed us trees or houses though of the same size will appear otherwise accord- ing to their nearness or distance those at distance appearing less than those on the fore ground and those that are farther off yet less this proportion you must be careful to represent accordingly because it is that which principally gives the ap- pearance of distance and is one of the grcatest beauties in view or landscape as may be seen by the examples annexed and are best inculcated by the appearance of objects according to their situation in nature the foregoing rules are necessary to be known and will rea- dily advance student therefore he who intends the imitative arts for his profession should well attend to them -- but the gentleman who means no further from his pursuit than an ac- complishment may be less solicitous in the discipline of rule since though he become no great proficient taste only will enable him to judge properly of the works of such eminent mas- ters who have or may hereafter improve the graphic arts
