bardwele elf introduction is an observation of plinys that the ancients painted with four colours only and out of them made all their teints monficur de piles is of opinion that it was of thefe they made their grounds or what we call the dead-colouring it really was tine has put it out of our power to determine but if we suppose thofe four principal colours in perfection then think it can be no longer doubted but that from them might be made all the various colours in nature for my part can not believe that the four capital colours of the antients would mix to that furprifing perfection we fee in the works of tilian and rubens and if we have no certain knowlege of their method of colouring who lived in the laft century how should we underftand theirs who lived near two thouland vears ago and why the method and practice of colouring which was fo well in oduct on known to rubens and van dyck should not be continued down to the pretent mlafters is to me furprifing muft confess have often thought and still believe that thofe painters who had acquired to fine manner of colouring might if they pleafed have communicated it to pofteriry in writing but never heard that any attempt was made towards it tho tis probable there might be some it is attonithing neverthelefs all enrope should fuffer alike at the fame time for want of that noble franknefs and generous spirit which might have been expected from thofe mafters and which would have done the world more service than their pictures it is plain from the works of their pupils that they knew it becaute in their pictures we fee the fame sort of colours and colouring and from the little variety of capital colours and sameness of method ufed by them it is not to be doubted but the whole was contained in few principles neither difficult nor tedious if we trace the art through its feveral declenfions we shall find rembrandt who was mafter of all the parts of colouring in the higheff degree lived to the vear next to him was zouff who died in lely lived to the year reily england about eight vears after who was zouft ’ disciple furvived them and was left the beft colourift we had mr. richardson who died about the vear was his pupil but in my opinion in point of merit much his inferior reily think declined in the same proportion to zouft that louff did to rembrandt as all thefe mafters from rembrandt funk gradually below each other in the art of colouring we may with certainty date the declenfion of that art from him can not attribute this gradual degeneracy in the knowlege of to charm- ing an art to any thing but inability or want of that generofity have before mentioned or both tho thefe gentlemen were not able to give us to perfect an account as the great mafters yet they might have com- municated what they learned from them and if it was againft their own private intereft to have published it whilft they practifed they should out of general regard to men of taffe and to the art itself have left it behind intr oduc on them to have given to pofterity an opportunity of reaping the benefit of their studies flatter myfelf that the following sheets compiled originally for my own ufe contain fomething that may be of confequence in sludying this art and hope the practicable method of colouring here laid down which has been the refult of much study and long experience and which now ufe will be found both ufeful and agreeable in the courfe of fludying this part of my art as could have no affiftance from the living found myfelf obliged to make my court to the dead mean their works and tho have had very little op- portunity to fludy even them yet from the few have copied have after tedious courfe of miftakes at laft by mere dint of labour and the affiftance of genius fuch as it is found the following method of colouring very eaty and expeditious painters fays de piles spend many fears in the search of knowlege which they might have attained in little time had they bit at first upon the right patb this truth have experienced and confess that the works of van dyck and rembrandt are the fureft guides to nature it is out of thefe moft excellent mafters that have eftablished my method it is from their pictures have found the firft lay of colours and from them have learned the virgin teints and finifhing secrets tho have always applied them to practice from nature in the method of my work begin with short and plain account of the principal colouns ufed in the flesn next follow with the principal teints first paintinc of dead-colouring second painting third or last painting of painting back-grounds some remarks on copying of drapery-painting of landscape-painting new thort and familiar account of the art of perspective ai b odu ti on thefe particulars have endeavoured to make familiar clear and instructive without defign to flatter or offend and thro the whole courfe of the work have had the utmoft regard to truth the motive of my publifhing is folely the benefit of the art such as are born with happy genius tho deftiture of mafter or guide may from thefe instructions acquire competent knowlege of colour- ing almoft without ftudying here the lovers of painting who ftudy for their pleafure and amufement may be conducted eafily rep by step to the secrets of that art which of all the defigning ones affords per- haps the greateft pleafure to the mind it may be objected to me by fome that my own works do not thew have either acquired or revived that art which according to my own confeffion has long time lain dormant am not the proper perfon to anfiver this objection neverthelefs have some copies by me that will leave to judges to compare in this point with any painting that has been done for the laft fixty or feventy years and believe could con- vince any artiff even at twice painting head from the great mafters that my method will certainly anfwer to all their variety of colouring and fure every fenfible painter will grant that that method which comes neareft to van dyck and rembrandt will certainly be the nearest way to nature since have eftablifhed myfelf in thefe principles muft inform the reader that find no difference in the method of the working between copying and painting from nature had iknown at my firft fetting out as much as have fince learned should have approached much nearer to thote great wafters others who have the advantage of vouth may pertuaded attain the end propofc is for them that write and moft fincerely with the rules lay down may contribute to reffore fo divine an art monficur de piles fays titian and rembrandt prepared their sirs lay or grounds very near alike and with colours that kindly united and were as near to the life as possible on which they laid their virgin teints with light strokes of the pencil and thus they imitated the force and freshness of nature in troduc ti on were convinced that there were certain colours which deftroyed each other if they were mixed to excess and that they should be as little shaken as possible by the notion of the pencil it would be folly in any man at this prefent time to affume fo much knowlege in the art of painting as monfieur de piles really had who was man of genius and learning that made painting his principal study and travelled on purpoto to complete his knowlege in that delight- ful art was intimately acquainted with the painters in his time who affifted him in fludying the works of the great wafters which he care- fully examined and from which he made his reffections and judicious remarks this was when the works of van dyck and rembrandt were more in perfection and in an age when painting was better underftood is it poffible for any thing to be more plain and intelligible than thefe two moft excellent remarks of monficur de piles which contain the principal matter and foundation of colouring this is vaftly different from theirs whofe colouring is as they pretend to change and wear to the complexion tho this may anfwer their purpofes yet none that ftudy the art of colouring will hope believe it it is certainly true that the great mafters imitated nature in their firft painting or dead-colour— ing to far as they could without dirtying the colours omitting only the finithing touches and colours that should come laft which defign to shew in the courfe of this work in the moft intelligible manner can and exactly to the rules and method of my prefent practice some painters imagine the great mafters had colours which we have no knowlege of and it is probable they might vetl confess fee none in the pictures of van dyck and rembrandt but what are common to painters only fome of them are better than ours which would be reme- died if that art was more encouraged by the painters thofe we have am convinced would appear much finer if they were laid on proper grounds painter should have as great regard to his firft lay as he has to the fucceeding parts of his work sir godfrey kneller in lely time udied his manner and prepared his grounds and firft lay of colours on int roduc ti on fuch cloths as lelyufed but after his death he foon fell into flighter manner which was more agreeable to his genius and inclination and invented the cold grey-coloured cloths on which he eftablifhed his flight expeditious manner then was the time when the painters expofed their underftanding in neglecting the charming stile of van dyck to follow kneller but tho colouring was not his talent yet he was in his time the beft face-painter in enrope nor has there been an artift fince him whofe heads can fland any comparifon with his after him co- louring hung here for fome time between the manners of mr. richardson and rofalba the followers of the latter failing in oil eftablished her method having traced the art of painting thro its feveral declenfions will venture to give my opinion on it as it flands at this prefent time in regard to portraiture and hope to do it in fuch manner as to offend no-body that may differ from me if may be allowed to judge from the pictures brought home by gentlemen from abroad as the works of the moft eminent living mafters may without partiality affirm that face-painting is no-where fo well performed as in england notwithfland- ing the prejudices of fome in favour of foreigners nor is it at all fur- prifing it should be fo fince where there is the greateft encouragement to an art thither the moft eminent mafters in that art will refort and there it will be improved to its greateft height it is well known that no nation in the world delights fo much in face-painting or gives fo generous encouragement to it as our own and it is equally known that no country affords fuch helps in regard to beautiful nature we have alfo the greateft number of van dyck ’ pictures and the reft of the best facc-painters rembrandt excepted of any people and it feems rea- fonable from thefe obfervations which are founded on matter of fact to infer that england is preferable to all other nations whatfoever in this respect and the beft place for fludying the art of face-painting can not but indulge fort of compaffion for thofe artifts as do for other miltaken men who conceive it abfolutely neceffary to traverfe nraty and other countries walting that time abroad which in my humble opi- nion may be employed at leaft as well at home in fludying the works of van dyck and the inimitable beauties of the english ladies which chink ol as much preferable to the antiques as the animated beauties of nature are to the cold initations of her in stone am informed there is scheme on foot to eftablifh an academy for painting and sculpture with it may fucceed as it muft probably in time improve thofe arts to the higheft perfection and will of courfe do honour to the nation and to the nobility who will from frequenting it for their amufement learn the principles of thofe arts and to become real judges dff e riut rideas the principal colovas used in the fieth from which all the teints are made lake-white or fine white is the very beft white we this colour should be ground with the fineft poppy oil than can be made at prefent our white is bad on account of the oil which is not really poppy white is friendly working colour and comes forward with vellows and reds but retires with blues and greens it is the nature of all whites to fink into whatever ground they are laid on therefore they should be laid on white grounds ivory-black is the beft black we have it is colour which fympathizes and mixes kindly with all the other it is true shade for blue ivory-black and little indian red make the beft general shadow- colour that can be it is ground with linfeed oil and used with drying oil black is cold retiring colour ul tramarine is the fineff blue in the world it is tender retiring colour and never glares and is beautiful glazing colour it is ufed with poppy oil prusstan is very fine blue and kind working colour it is ground with linfeed oil tho think nut oil is more proper it should never be ufed in the fleth but in the green teint and the eyes licht ol licht oker is friendly mixing colour and of great dic in the fleth it is ufually ground with linfeed oil but nut oil is better all fellows are ftrengthened with reds and weakened with blues and greens licht red is nothing but fine light oker burnt this and white in mixing produce the moft perfect fleth-colour that can be made it is beautiful clean kind working colour but too ftrong for the white and therefore will grow darker it should be ground and ufed with nut oil no vermillion but what is made of the true native cinnabar should ever be ufed it will not glaze but is fine colour when it is glazed it is ground with linfeed oil and should be ufed with drying oil carmine is the moft beautiful crimfon that can be it is middle colour between lake and vermillion is fine working colour and glazes delightfully it should be ground with nut oil and ufed with drying oil lake is tender fympathizing deepred but of no frong body therefore it should be ftrengthened with indian red it is the beft glazing colour that can be ufed it is ground with linfeed oil and ufed with drying oil indian red is ftrong pleafant working colour but will not glaze well and when mixed with white ralls little into the lead it is ground and ufed as the lake brown pink is fine glazing colour but of no ftrong body in the fleth it should never join or mix with the lights becaufe this colour and white antipathize and mix of warm dirty hae for which reafon their jonings should be blended with cold middle teint in glazing of shadows it should he laid before the other colours that are to enrich it it is one of the finithing colours and therefore should never be ufed alone in the firtt painting it is rengthened with burnt umber and ein weakened with terraverter ground with linfeed oil and ufed with drying oil burnt umber is fine warm brown and good working ftrong colour it is of great ufe in the hair and mixes finely with the warm shade of the principal teiwrs that are absolutely necesfary for painting fleth all which are made from the principal colours icht red teint is made of light red and white it is the a moft kind and best conditioned of all colours for the general ground of the fiesh with this colour and the shade-teint we should make out all the flesh like claro obfcuro or mezzontinto we should alfo remember that this colour will grow darker becaufe it is ifn its nature too ftrong for the white therefore we should improve it that is mix some vermillion and white with it in proportion to the fair- ness of the complexion and tho it is thus mixed yet shall call it the light-red teint in all the courfe of the work becaufe would not have the vermillion teint confounded with it as if there was no difference vermillyon teint is only vermillion and white mixed to middle teint it is the moft brilliant light-red that can be it agrees beft with the white lightred and vellow teints carmine teint is carmine and white only mixed to middle teint it is of all colours the moft beautiful red that can be for the checks and lips it is one of the finithing colours and should never be used in the firft painting but laid upon the finishing colours without mixing rose teint is made of the red shade and whice mixed to middle degree or lighter it is one of the cleaneft and moft delicate teints that eint can be used in the flesh for clearing up the heavy dirty colours and therefore in changing will fympathize and mix kindly vellow teint is often made of naples vellow and white but make it of light oker and white which is good working colour remember the oker is too ftrong for the white therefore we should make little allowance in uting it it follows the light-red teints and should always be laid before the blues if we lay too much of it ws may recover the ground it was laid on with the light-red teints blue teint is made of ultramarine and white mixed to lighrith azure it is pleafant working colour with it we should blend the gradations it follows the vellows and with them it makes the greens and with the red it produces the purples no colour is fo proper for blending down or foftening the lights into keeping lead teint is made of ivory-black and fine white mixed to middle degree it is fine retiring colour and therefore is of great ufe in the gradations and in the eyes green teint is made of pruffian light oker and white this colour will dirty the lights and should be laid paringly in the middle teints it is moft ufed in the red shadows where they are too ftrong it is of dirty antipathizing nature shade-teint is made of lake indian red black and white mixed to beautiful murrey colour of middle teint this is the beft colour for the general ground of shadows for which reafen call it the shade-teint it mixes with the lights delightfully and produces pleafant clean colour little inclined to the redith pearl as all the four colours of its composition are of friendly fympathizing nature fo confe- quently this will be the fame and therefore may be eafily changed by the addition of any other colours red shade is nothing but lake and very little indian red it is charming working colour and good glazer it ftrengthens the shadows on the shade-teint and receives when it is wet the green and blue teints agreeably it is good ground for all dark shadows warm fir ba in i warm shade is made of lake and brown pink mixed to middle degree it is fine colour for ftrengthening the shadows on the shade-teint when they are wet or dry we muft take care that it does not touch the lights becaufe they will mix of dirty snuff-colour and therefore should be foftened with tender cold teint dark shade is made of ivory-black and little indian red only this colour mixes very kindly with the red shade and tympa- thizes agreeably with the middle teints in the dead-colouring it is it is charming glazing colour for the eyc-brows and darkeft shadows of all the moft excellent shadow-colour and one of the fineft working colours we have haks aasftr hpetefdpt ankeh hheeehheeeigrr first painting the colours and teints that are necesary for the firft painting of the fleth ine whice light oker—and its two teints light red —_ _____and its two teints vermillion ___ and its teint teint made of lake vermillion and white rofe teint blue teint lead teint green teint half-fhade teint— is made of indian red and white shade-teint red shade warm shade the finifhing pallet for fine complexion requires fix more viz carmine and its teint lake brown pink ivory-black and pruffian bluc the ir pa in in firft painting or dead-colduring divide into two parts the firft call the firft lay or ground the second the laying on the virgin teints the firft lay of colours confifts of two parts the one is the work of the shadows only and the other that of the lights the work of the shadows is to make out all the drawing very cor- rectly with the shade-teint in the fame manner as if it was to be done with this colour only and remember to drive or lay the colour paringly the lights should be all laid in with the light-red teint in different de- grees as we fee them in nature thefe two colours united produce clean tender middle teint for mixing with the shade-teint they turn to pearly hue and by ftrengthening them with the lightred we may work to very good refemblance in uniting the lights and shades we should ufe long softener about the size of large swans-quill which will help to bring the work into character and leave the colour— ing more delicate then go over the darkeft shadows with the red or warm shade which will finish the firft lay the warm shade being laid on the shade-teint improves it to warmer hue but if laid inftead of the shade-teint it will dirty and spoil the colours it mixes with and if the red shade be laid firft inftead of the shade-teint the shadows would then appear toored and bloody therefore notwithflanding thefe two colours are the beft that can be for the shadows yet they are too ftrong to be laid alone which is proof of the great ufe and merit of the shade-teint fere we may obferve that the shade and light-red teints are to friendly and delicate in their natures that they will not dirty tho we are continually changing them how proper then and agreeable to our purpofe are they for making the moft principal part of the likeness when in altering and changing they always produce clean colour of the inviting pearly ffue the second part of the first painting in order to finith the firft painting improve the reds and vellows to the complexion and after them the blues obferving that the blues on the the reds make the purple and on the vellows produce the green same fir pa in in method is to be underftood of the shadows but be fure to leave them clean and not too dark therefore allowance should be made in their grounds with the light-red becaufe glazing them will make them darker when the cloth is of dark or bad colour there muft be itrong body of colour laid all over the shadows fuch as will not fink into the ground but appear warm and little lighter than the life fo that it may be of the same forwardness to finish as if it had been light ground therefore the bufinets of dead-colouring is that we leave it always in the same order for finishing tho the colour of the cloth be quite the reverfe am convinced by experience that the grounds of shadows in what we call the dead-colouring should be fuch as will fupport the character of the finithing colours which ground muft be clean and little lighter than the finithing colours fay little lighter becaufe the finifhing of shadows is glazing and no other method but glazing can leave fuch brilliancy and beauty as they ought to have for find that glazing the shadows in the firft painting is not to proper as laying body of shadow- colours that are very near to the life tho little lighter thefe may be glazed and touched upon when dry with great deal of eafe but if we begin the pirft painting with glazing we shall find it will ftare and be of no ofe and the folid colours which are laid on it will look heavy and dull therefore all shadows and colours that are to be glazed should be done with colours of clean folid body becaufe the glazing is more lafting and has the beft effect on fuch colours remember to leave no roughness mean fuch as will appear rough and interrupt or hurt the character of the finifhing colours which by examining the work whilft it is wet with foft tool or when it is dry with knife may be avoided as it will eafily take off the knots and rougheft parts the lightred and white improved is fuperior to all other colours for the firft lay or ground which should be always done with full pencil of fliff colour made brighter than the life becaufe it will fink little in drying the greater the body and quantity of colour and the stiffer it is laid the less it will fink every colour in drying will fink and partake in proportion to its body of the colour it is laid on therefore all the lights of the flesh if not laid on light ground muft confe- quently ..ond .ai nt in.. change little from the life if there is no allowance made the shade-teint for the shadows should fall into the rofe teint as the com- plexion grows delicate all which should be lightly united with foft long pointed hog-tool to the lights making out the whole like mezzotinto believe the great wafters very feldom sweetened or foftened the co- lours but in uniting the firft lay they were very careful in preferving the brightness of their colours and therefore did not work them below the complexion for to force or keep up brilliancy in the grounds can only be done with the whites reds and fellows which method will make up for the deficiency of the white grounds therefore the firft painting should be left bright and bold and the lets the colours are broken the better we should forbear ufing any colours that will prejudice them and be contented to add what is avanted the next painting where if we fail clean rag will reffore the firft ground second pain tin.. the second painting begins with laying on the leaft quantity that can be of poppy oil then wipe it almoft all off with dry piece of silkhandkerchief the second painting is alfo divided into two parts one call the firft lay of the second painting which is fcumbling the lights and glazing the shadows the other finithing the complexion with the virgin teints and improving the likeness as far as we can without daubing scumbling is going over the lights where they are to be changed with the light-red teints or fome other of their own colours fuch as avill always clear and improve the complexion with short fliff pencils but fuch parts only as require it otherwife the beauty of the firft painting will be spoiled and we make ourfelves double work the light-red teint improved is the very beft colour that can be for scumbling and improving the complexion in general where the shadows and hir pa in in drawing are to be corrected we should do it with the shade-teint by driving the colour very ftiff and bare that we may the eafier rerouch and change it with the finithing teints some parts of the shadows should be glazed with fome of the tranfparent shadow-colours fuch as will improve and come very near to the life but be fure not to lay on too much of it for fear of lofing the hue of the firft painting the ground of which should always appear through the glazing be very careful in uniting the lights and shades that they do not mix dead and meally for the more the lights mix with the shades the more meally thofe shades will appear thus far the complexion is prepared and improved in order to receive the virgin teints and finifhing touches the second part of the second painting is to go over the complexion with the virgin teints thefe are the colours which improve the colouring to the greateft perfection both in the lights and shadows this should be done in the fame manner as we laid them in the second part of the firft painting that is with the reds yellows and blues blending them with delicate light touches of the tender middle teints without foftening we should leave the teints and their grounds clean and diftinct and be content to leave off whilft the work is fafe and unfullied leaving what is farther required for the next sitting for in attempting the finifhing touches before the other is dry we lofe the spirit and drawing and dirty where-ever we touch ikkkkkkocrjjdiectukkkmkk the third paintinc or pin ishinc is to be fuppofed the complexion now wants very little more than few light touches therefore there will be no occafion for oiling begin with correcting all the glazing firft where the glazing ferves as ground or under part then we should determine what should be done next before we do it to that we may be able to make the alteration on the part with one stroke of the pencil by this method we preserve both ce-cr und the glazing and the teints but if it happens that we can not lay tuch variety of teints and finifhing colours as we intended it is much better to leave off while the work is fafe and in good order becaufe thofe few touches which would endanger the beauty of the colouring may eafily be done if we have patience to stay till the colours are dry and then without oiling and those finishings with free light strokes of the pencil believe that rembrandt touched upon his beft pictures great many times letting them dry between it was this method moft certainly which gave them that furprifing force and spirit which is to inimitable find it much eafier to foften the over-ffrong teints when they are dry than when they are wet becaufe we may add the very colours that are wanting without endangering the dry work if any of the colours of the pallet want to be little changed to the life when we are painting it is much better to do it with the knife on the pallet than with the pencil becaufe the knife will mix and leave it in good order for the pencil back-grounds dyck made out the keeping in his back-grounds more from the different opposition and harmony of the colours than from his knowledge of the claro obfcuro confess can not find in his pictures that intelligence of light and shade which is to striking and beautiful in rembrandts van dycks general nethod was to be very still and mellow and to break the colours of the ground with thofe of the drapery this vill certainly produce harmony the principles of which method belong only to the art of colouring but it is the knowlege of light and shade which gives that furprifing force and strength which at firft sight we find in rembrandts works have feen picture of lady where he has made the ground juft light enough to thew her complexion and hair which was dark brown in the greateft perfection the ground was wall which near to the pace was lighter than the shadows of the fiesh and und the light diminished to arttully in the gradations that though the part round the head was much darker yet it appeared to be of the fame colour with that near the flefh muft own like this nicthod of relieving the hlead from the ground betterthan an dyck method where he has made the ground almoft of the fame colour with the hair and though admire his way of breaking the colours of the ground with thote of the draperies yer am not to much pleafed where there appears too near samenets as have feen in fome of his pictures where he has carried this principle to near that it is almoft imperceptibic in rembramdts pictures at farmouth the lights and shades are as vitible as thofe in his prints and are remarkably broad clear and still the shadows are very warm and thin and look as if they were painted all at once with plenty of colour which appears tranfparent which tranfparency was done by glazing the dead colouring the principal colours that are neceffary for painting of back-grounds in portraiture as walls buildings or the like are white black indian red light and brown oker pruffian and burnt uumber from which the eight principal teints are made as follows pearl is made of black white and little indian red le ad of black and white mixt to dark lead colour vellow of brown oker and white olive of light oker pruffian and white flesi of indian red and white mixt to middle teint murrey of indian red white and little black mixt to kind of purple of middle teint stone of white umber black and indian red dark-shade of black and indian red only here the lead teint ferves for the blues the fleth teint mixes agree- ably with the lead and the murrey is very good blending colour and of great ufe where the olive is too frong the umber white and dark shade will produce fine variety of stone colours the dark shade and umber ufed plentifully with drying oil make charming warm shadow-colour all the colours should be laid with drying oil only becaufe they mix and fet the better with the softener where un the marks of the trowel are fo ftrong in the priming of the cloth that one body of colours will not be fufficient to conceal it we should lay colour to prevent it which should be dry before we begin with those parts that we expect to finith at once painting the method of painting back-grounds divide into two parts the firft part is the work of the firft lay the second is to follow on that with the finithing teints of the first lay we should always begin from the shadowed side of the head and paint the lights firft from them go into the gradations and shadows which should be done with large ftiffith tool very paringly with the dark shade and white little changed with the colours that will give it more of the required hlue but very near in regard to tone and strength leaving them like mezzotinto the dark and warm shadows should be laid before the colours that join them this we should do with the dark shade and umber drove with drying oil fay before the colours that join them becaute if thote colours were laid on firft they would interrupt and fpoil the tranf parency which is their greateft beauty the more the firft lay is drove the cafier and better we may change it with the finifhing teints there- fore we may lay them with the greater body the second part is to follow directly whilft the firft lay is wet with thofe teints that we think are moft proper to harmonize and finish with begin with the lights firft and remember as we heighten and finish them we do it with warmer colours and let thofe be accompanied with tine tender cold teints.. the lighteff part of the ground is always neareft to the fhadowed side of the head this is the part which governs all the roft and should be painted with variety of light warm clear colours which vanifh and lafe their strength imperceptibly in the gradations thefe ck- und should be laid with kind of cloudy touch rather than potted and we muft take care that we do not cover too much of the firft lay but confider it as the principal colour from the lights we go to the gradations and shadows for when the lights are well adapted to produce and fupport the head it is eafy think to fall from them into whatever kind of shadows we shall find moft pro- per for our work then foften and blend the whole with long large hog-tool which with the strength and body of the drying oil will melc and sweeten all together in fuch flattering manner as will seem furprife- ingly finifhed remember the teints will fink and lofe little of their strength and beauty in drying all the grounds as walls sc should be finished at once painting but if they want to be changed we may glaze them with little of the dark shade and drying oil drove very bare on which with few light touches of the colour that is wanting we may improve their hue the dark shadows may alfo be ftrengthened and im- proved by glazing which should be done after the figures are near finished for fear of making them too ftrong fee rembrandt grounds are rather brighter in the lights and have more variety of teints than any other painters and to be fure he had obferved and juftly too that thofe teints diminish in proportion with the lights therefore his shadows have but faint appearance of teints ie underftood the gradations in perfection by mixing and breaking the firft lay of colours fo artfully that they flatter us in regard to their real strength frefnoy fays let the field or ground of the picture be pleafant free transient light and well united with colours which are of friendly nature to each other and of such mixture as that there may be something in it of every colour that composes your work as it were the contents of your pallet de piles fays variety of teints very near of the same tone employed in the same figure and often upon the same part with moderation contri- bute much to harmony all the curtains should be dead-coloured when we paint the ground and should be done with clean colours of near fiue to the intended curtain py in fuch as will fupport the finishing colours do it with tender fort of keeping and near in regard to their tone in the lights but much fofter in the shadows all which should be mixed and broken with the colours of the ground and as fresnoy fays bodies that are back in the ground should be painted with colours allied to those of the ground irfelf it will often happen for want of the life or fome defign that we can not make the folds the firft painting we should then leave the maffes of light and shadow in regard to the keeping of the picture broad and well united together fuch as may feem eafy to finith on the colours of the landlkip in back-grounds should be broke and foftened alfo with thote of the parts which join them this method brings them into keeping which will make all the parts of the ground as it were of one piece to that the different parts do not ftare nor cut at their extre- ilitics the sky should be broke with the lead and the fleth teints the murrey teint is of great ofe in the grounds of diftant objects and the umber and dark shade in the near grounds the greens should be more beautiful than we inted them becaufe they will fade and grow darker after all is painted we should go over the whole very lightly with the softener aswe did the grounds which will make it look agreeably finifhed on ick an nl drs on copying author of the anclyps of becuty has given his opinion of copying in his true spirit and genius treating with ridicule one of the moft ufeful parts of painting this impute to his want of akill in this branch of the art or to moft ill-grounded prejudice for is it reafonable to believe that painter who underftands the true merit of copying would treat that part of the art with contempt which the greatelt mafters have always practifed and eftcemed men of common senfe know that the artifts in all ages have copied and ftudied each other in whatever they found moft for their purpofe and for the advance- nent py in of their art was it not for this the art itfelf would foon dwindle and decay and with this has not been the cafe with us rubens ftudied principally the works of tition pal veronef and tintoret that is he copied fuch of their pictures as he thought moft worthy his imitation and kept them for his own ufe van dyck copied titian and all the venetian school or in de piless phrafe simmed their cream teniers is celebrated for transforming him- self into as many wafters as he copied which he did to exactly that it is hard to diftinguith the copies from the originals henneman copies of van dyck are taken for the originals of that great wafter have seen copies by stone fold at great prices for undoubted originals notwith- standing they were divefted of that free pencilling and charming variety of teints which are fo apparent in van dyck bucksborn was one of the laft good copiers we have had in england the reft that followed him and his mafter lely foon dwindled to half-artifts there is copy of buck- orn ’ painting after van dyck which like much better than any of stones mean the picture of the earl of strefford and his secretary in the marquis of rockingbam collection which is well painted and de- servedly efteemed believe every one that has heard of andrea del sarto ’ copy of lco the tenth painted by raphael and tulio romano will be convinced of the great ofe and merit of an art to which is owing that great number of originals now abounding in every country by originals mean pictures imposed as fuch by our ingenious and honeft dealers to adorn the cabinets of the virtuofi and connoiffcurs it is furprifing that fince the age of thefe great mafters we have not had man able to make fine copy from any one of their pictures and believe if fuch genius should hereafter arife it is to be feared the de- aroyers of the art if they are suffered to go on will feour off the remains off their beauties to that very little will be left for him to fludy and by the end of this century there will be none fit for copying py in is in vain for man to think of making fine lmitation of any of the great mafters without being thoroughly acquainted with the nature of colours and of colouring and without being clearly con- vinced at sight of the picture he is going to copy of the method and principles on which it was painted it is the want of this knowlege and conviction which leads us into fo many errors and miltakes painter that has acquired any sort of mlanner will always tincture his copying with the fame now -- days we are too apt to fall into manner before we underfland the nature of colours which is the cafe where fome predominant colour or hue appears in all the complexions alike for this reaton painter whofe carnations are too red will cer- tainly make his copies bluth or if his colouring and shadows be heavy they will of courfe fall into the obicuro by the jame rule whatever teints infect his colouring the same will unavoidably taint his copying for which there is no cure becaufe he himfelf is infected monlicur de piles fays it is very rare to change bad manner in colour- ing for better that raphael michael angelo lconardo da vinci julio romano and otber great mafters spent their whole lives without truly underslanding good colouring and tho colouring is the principal excel- lence in copying yet it is neceffary that every artift should avoid particular wlanner with his pencil otherwife it will certainly be feen in his work from what has been faid on this subject apprehend it appears that the art of copying which was practifed by the great mafters in order to catch each other excellencies and perfections and by which their noble works have been to often repeated and as it were renewed is to to far from deferving contempt that it ought to be encouraged as thing highly ufeful and worthy of eftcem per wi hr is wmr hr h hr mr tmr mor- painting dr pee order to underftand the nature and different degrees of colours or teints ufed in painting draparies firft determine how many di- vifions are absolutely neceffary to make the firft lay of colours and after that the reffects and finishing teints the right method of painting draperies or sattins in general is to make out the whole or what call the firft lay with three colours only viz the lights middle teint and shade-teint for the lights mean the colour of all the high lights the middle teint should be very near to the general hue of the sattin cec and of an exact middle degree between the high lights and the shade- teint the shade-teint would have dark enough for the general hlue- of all the shadows for which reafon call it the shade-teint we should obferve that the lights should rather incline to warmiffi hue and the middle teint should be made of friendly working colours tuch as will always mix of clean tender coldish flue the shade-teint should be made of the fame colours as the middle teint only with less light therefore this teint will alfo mix of tender clean colour it is with thefe three colours we should make out the whole like mezzotinto and we should underfland that all the beauty and character of the folds the shape attitude and principal lights and shades are all to be con- sidered and made with thefe three colours only which should be done to our satisfaction before we add any of the reffects or finifhing teints the reffects of drapery and sattins are generally productions of their own and are always lighter than the shadows on which they are found and being produced by light will confequently have light warm colour mixed with the local colour that receives them here it will be neceffary pe observe the general method and secret in managing the colours of the fisil lay and thote of the retlects and finithing teints in the first lay the high lights should be laid with plenty of siff colour and then ship ’ and fotten ’ into character with the middle teint vely correctly where the gradations of the lights are llow as in the large parts it will be proper to lay the middle teint firft at their extre- mities with tool that will drive the colour and leave it paringly be- caute the lights will mix and lie the better upon it next is to make out all the parts of the shadows with the shade-teint drove barc after this comes the middle teint which fills up and ferves as the fecond light and gradations and should be managed together very nicely to character without touching any of the high lights which finith the firtt lay the reffleets and finifhing teints are in general the antipathies of the firttlay they will without great care poifon and dirty the colours on which they are laid and therefore should be laid with delicate light touch without foftening if it is over-done we muft remember to recover it with the colour of the part on which it was laid this may be done directly or when it is dry we should alfo observe whether the retleets proceed from the fame colour or any other that the method of uting them is the tame before proceed to the particular colours it will be proper to make fome observations on their grounds it often hapens that the colour of the cloth is very improper for the ground of the drapery and when it is fo we should change it with thofe colours which we think are moft proper to improve and support the sinithing colours this method of dead-colouring muft confequently preferve them in their greateft luftre in dead-colouring we should lay the lights and shades in manner to as only to thew faint idea of them with regard to the shape and roundings of the figure if we have betign to work from then it will be proper to make all the large and principal parts in their places which should always be done with colour that is clean and lighter than the intended drapery tho in gene- ist of the fame ilue and let the shadows be no darker than middle teint white sattin dr per thefe should be mix ’ and broke in tender manner and then foftend with large tool to that nothing rough or uneven be left to interrupt or hurt the character of the finithing colours white sattin all whites should be painted on white grounds laid with good body of colour by reafon this colour finks more into the ground than any other there are four degrees of colours in the firft lay to white sattin the firft is the fine white for the lights the second is the firft teint which is made of fine white and very little lvory-black mixed to an exact middle degree between the white and middle teint this co- lour follows the white and it is with this we should shape the lights into character before we lay on any other and take care that this firft teint appear diftinctly between the white and the middle teint other- wife the beauty and character of the sattin will be fpoiled the middle teint should be made of white black and little indian red thefe three colours are very friendly and mix to beautiful clear colour of pearly hfue which has the true brightness and warmth of the general hue of the sattin remember to allow for the red huc changing little to the lead if there is occafion to make any part in the middle teint lighter we should do it with the firft teint only this colour should alfo be laid fparingly before the white in all the little lights that happen in the middle teints and shadows on which we should lay the white with one light touch and be fure not to cover all the part that was made with the firft teint if we do it will spoil the character and look like spot for want of the foftening edge or bor- der which muft be between the white and the middle teint the shade-teint should be made of the fame colour as the middle teint but with lefs white to that it he dark enough for the shadows in gene- ral with which we should make out all the parts of the shadows nicely to character which is the work of the firft lay next sattin dr aper tes come the reffects and finishing teints brown oker mixed with the colour of the lights is the moft ufeful colour in general for all reffects in draperies that are produced from their own colours all accidental retlexes are made with the colour of the parts from which they are produced and the local colours that receive them there are but two reflecting teints wanted for draperies in general mean to any one particular colour one should be lighter than the middle teint the other darker thefe colours may be little changed on the pallet with the firft and middle teints as occation requires or lightly broken on the part that receives them but this laft method is not to fafe as the other the teint fufficient for blending the dark shadows to the mellow tender hue is made with the shade-teint and little brown oker which should be laid on very paringly with foft light touches for fear of making them dull and heavy if it should be over-done we may recover it with the colour it was laid upon we often fee little blue ufed in the firft teint of white sattin van haecken who was the beft drapery-painter we ever had in england did to and fometimes inftead of the blue he ufed bluc-black till he found it to be pernicious colour and was therefore obliged to ufe blue be- caufe his middle teint which was made only of black and white was to very cold that no other colour but blue would make colder teint tet he managed thefe cold colours in all the lights and middle teints to agreeably and to light and eaty was his touch that we can not help admiring and may learn fomething from him tho he was not folucky in his shadows which were generally of heavy dirty hue this was owing to the colours he uted and the method of uting them which will always have fuch an effect when warm or dirty colour is mixed with clean light one for being mixed together they will form dirty colour that muft confequently appear to in the work but if his lead or shade-teint had been mixed with indian red instead of the oker and then followed with few light blending touches of the oker-teint it would have left them clean and mellow it is the want of the red huc which makes the white sattins appear to often like pewter bive bhie sattin draperies sat tin blue sattin is made of pruffian blue and fine whice the bett ground for blue is white for the lights and black and white for the shadows the firft lay of colours for blue is divided into three degrees or teints we should firtt make the middle teint of beautiful azure then mix the colour for the lights about middle degree between that and white make the shade-teint dark enough for the shadows in gene- ral all the broad lights should be laid with plenty of colour and shap ’ to character with middle teint before we lay on any other colours remember the less the colours are mixed the better they will appear and fland for the lights of blue should be managed with as much care as thofe of white sattin next is to follow with the reft of the middle teint and then make out all the shadows the more we drive the shade-teint the better it will receive the reffects and finishing teints the shadows should be ftrengthened and blended with lvory-black and fome of their own colour which will mix with them into tender mellow fluc the reffects are made as thofe of white sattin that is with oker and fome of the lights which should be perfectly done as we intend it the shadows when dry may be little improved at once painting if there is occation to alter them with the colours they were made with the pruffian proper to be uted is that which looks of the moft beautiful azure before it is ground and the fooner it is ufed after ir is ground the better it will work and appear velvet may he painted at once the method is to make out the firft lay with the middle teint and shade-teint on which we should lay the high lights with light touches and finith the shadows as we did thofe of the sattin but the neareft imitation of velvet we can make is done by glazing which is to prepare ground or dead-colouring blue with tuch colours as will when dry hear out and fupport the glazing colour in its higheft perfection the nature of the glazing colour is to be of fine trantparent quality and ufed fimply with oil only fir that whatever ground it is laid on the whole may appear diftinctly thro' it the heft crround for blue is made with white and lvory-black the whire is for the hligh lights which with the middle teint and shade-teint makes our the firtt lay like mezzotinto remember to make the mliddle teint lighter in proportion to the glazing becaute that will make it the darker it is often neceffary to cover all but the high lights with thin clazing do not mean with plenty of oil in the colour but laid with lets quantity than if it was to be done once only if any of it touch the lights we should wipe it off with clean rag the very high lights should be improved and made of fine white and left to dry the glazing colour is pruflian ground very fine with nut oil and should be laid with large ftiffith tool that will drive the colour as occafion requires it is on the laft glazing we should ftrengthen and finith the shadows the greateft fault in the colouring of draperies is the painting the shadows with ftrong glaring colours which deftroy the beauty of the lights this is not only the reverfe of art but of nature whofe beauty always diminifhes in proportion with the lights for this rea- ton we should take care to blend and foften the shadows with fuch friendly colours as will agree with their local character and obfcurity here we may obterve that glazing the middle teint which is made of black and white will not produce colour to blue as if it had been prepared with prullian and white yet this colour will preferve the eeauty of the lights in the higheft perfection by reafon of iis tender abteure tlue when the eluenets of the other would only diminith them this mlethed of glazing the eluc is the general rule for all claring winen we are glazing blue the lights may be glazed with ultra- marine tho all the other parts are done with pruffian this method levee great cquantity of that valuable colour and anfivers our purpote is veil as if it had all been done with ultramarinc though scarlet dr aper ie this general method of painting sattins is to make the firft lay of colours with three degrees or teints yet we should underftand in ufing them that they produce two more for the mixing of two dit- ferent colours together on the cloth will make another of middle teint between them so it is with the lights and middle teint and with the middle and shade-teint the firft antvers to the firft teint in white sattin and the laft will confequently be fort of gradating or hialf-shadc if the lights and middle teint mix to beautirul clean colour of middle hue between both there will be no occation for colour to go between them as in the blue sattin but if in mixing they produce teint inclining to dirty warm hue then there must be another found of trmpathizing nature which should be laid between them in order to preferve the beauty of the lights as the firft teint in the white sattin for if it was not fo the red in the middle teint would certainly dirty and poil the white it is highly neceffary to underfland thefe principles of the firft lay of colours in order to have perfect knowlege of the general rule of co- louring on which the principles of colouring depend scarlet and crimson light vellow-red made of light oker light-red and white is the proper ground for scarlet the shadows are indian red and in the darkeft parts mixed with very little black the second painting should be little lighter than we intend the finiffi- ing colour mean in proportion to the clazing which will make it darker the high lights are vermillion and white for sattin and velvet and vermillion for cloth the middle teint is vermillion with very little lake or indianred the shade-teint is made with indian red and lake with the addition of little black in the darkeft shadows the difference between scarlet and crimfon is that the hligh lights of crimfon are whiter and the middle teint is made darker their reffects are made wicli lizht draper ie pink yellow and vermillion the high lights should be laid and managed in the same manner as thofe of the blue for fear of dirtying them and foinctimes they require to be rouched over the fecond time before we glaze them the more the colours of the second painting are drove the eafier and better they may be managed to character but the high lights should have good body of colour and be left with delicate light touch after it is well dry we should finish with glazing the whole with fine lake and improve the reffects and shadows remember that the scarlet requires but very thin glazing and it is better to glaze the lrimfon twice over then lay too much at once painting pink-colour there are two different methods of painting pink-colour one is by clizing the other is done with body of colours at one painting the jame grounds do for both which should be whitith colour inclining to vellow for the lights and indian red lake and white for the shadows the second painting for the glazing method is done with the fame colours and little vermillion for the reffects and vermillion and white for the high lights when it is dry we should glaze it with fine lake and then break and foften the shadows into character and hlar- mony directly the other method is to make the high lights with carmine and white the middle teint with lake white and little carmine and the shadows with lake and indian red with latle vermillion for the rehleels but remember the shadows will require to be broken with fome render oblcure teint vell the ground for vellow should be yellowith white for the lights and mixture of the okers for the shadows there dr apertes green are the fame number of teints in the vellow as there are in the white sattin the method of ufing them is the very fame the lights are made with king vellow ground with clean good drying oil the firft teint is light oker changed with little of the pearl teint made with the dark shade and white which should be laid and managed as the firft teint in white sattin the middle teint is mixture of the light and brown oker foftened with the pearl teint the shade-teint is made with brown pink and brown oker thefe belong to the firft lay the reffects are light oker and fometimes in the warmest parts mixed with little light-red the shadows are ftrengthened with brown pink and burnt umber thefe colours well managed will produce vellow very like virn dicks but if we leave out the king vellow which is the high lights only then it will be one of lety favourite vellows green the proper ground for green is light-yellow green which is made of light oker little white and pruffian for the lights and the okers brown pink and pruffian for the shadows the fineft green we have for drapery is made of king vellow pruffian and brown pink the high lights are king vellow and very little pruffian the middle teint has more pruffian and the shade- teint is made with fome of the middle teint brown pink and more pruffian eur the darkeft shadows are brown pink and little prullian the lights and middle teint should be managed in the fame manner as thofe of the blues the shade-teint should be kept intirely from the lights becaute the brown pink that is in it will in mixing dirty them as the black does thofe of the blues remember to allow for their drying little darker and that the kipg vellow should be ground with good drying oil for the longer it is dlying the more it will change and grow darker and the fooner it is ufed the better it will sland it is proper to have two sorts of king vellow mean one to be very light which will do beft for the high lights of velvet changf- colours are made with four principal teints viz the high lights middle teint shade-teint and reffecting teint the greateft art lies in finding the exact colour of the middle teint becaute it has more of the general hue of the silk than any of the others the shade-teint is of the fame ffue with the middle teint though it is dark enough for the shadows the high lights though often very dif- terent from the middle teint should be of clean friendly working colour that will in mixing with it produce teint of clean fympa- thizing llue the mcthod of painting silks is to make out the folds with the shade teint and then fill them up in the lights with the middle teint this is what call the firft lay which should be done to our satisfaction before we addany other colours and the hiffer the middle teint is ufed the better the high lights may be laid upon it the reffecting teint fallsge- nerally upon the gradating half-shades and should be laid with tender touches paringly for fear of fpoiling the firft lay this nicthod of painting anfwers to all the coloured silks as well as changeable with this difference only that the plain colours require not to much art in matching the teints as the changeable do the laft part of the work is the finithing and ftrengthening the shadows with an obicure teint little inclining to mellowith hue fuch as will not catch the eyc and interrupt the beauty of the lights blace the heft ground for black is light-red for the lights and indian red and little black for the shadows the finithing colours are for the lights black white and little takc the middle teint has lefs white and more lake and black the black draper ie shade-teint is made of an equal quantity of lake and brown pink with very little black the method of painting black is very different from that of other colours for as the principal thing in them is to leave their lights clean and brilliant fo in black it is to keep the shadows clear and tranfparent therefore we should begin with the shade-teint and glaze over all the shadows with it next lay in the darkeft shadows with black and little of the shade-teint very correctly after that fill up the whole breadth of lights with the middle teint only all which should be done exactly to the character of the sattin cc and then finith with the high lights here we may obferve the ground being red will bear out and fup- port the reds which are ufed in the finithing colours the lake in the lights takes off the cold hue and gives it more beautiful colour if the shade-teint was of any other colour than tranfparent warm hue the shadows would confequently be black and heavy becaufe no other colours can preferve the warm brilliancy which is wanting in the shadows of the black like lake and brown pink black is of cold heavy nature and always too ftrong for any other colour therefore we should make an allowance in ufing it there will be few reflects in sattin which should be added as thofe of other colours but they should be made of arong colours fuch as burnt umber or brown oker mixt with little of the shade-teint though the grounds which have mentioned for the draperies are absolutely neceffary for the principal and neareft figures in picture fuch as fingle portrait or the like yet do not intend them to for figures which are placed more into the picture such as are behind the principal of front figures their grounds should always be fainter in proportion to their local finishing colours linen the colours ufed in linen are the fame as thofe in white sattin except the firft teint which is made of whice and ultramarine affies inftead of the black and mixt to very light blucith teint in draper ie linen the dead-colouring we should take particular care that the grounds be laid very white and broad in the lights the shadows are made with black white and little indian red like the middle teint of white sattin thefe should be left very light and clean in order to fup- port the finifhing colours the second painting begins with glazing all the lights with stiff pen- cil and fine white only drove bare without ufing any oil the shadows may be fcumbled with poppy oil and some of the colour they were made of this is the firft lay on which we are to follow with the finithing colours directly the middle teint of white sattin is the beft colour for the general hue of the shadows with this and white in different degrees we should make out all the parts to character with free light touches without foftening then with large long-pointed pencil and fine white lay the high lights very nicely with one stroke after this comes the fine light blueith teint which should be mixed light and laid in the tender gradations very paringly and lightly without filling them up remember the firft lay should be left clear and diftinet the more it appears the better it is the overmixing and joining all the colours toge- ther which fpoils the beauty of the character therefore it is better to let it dry before we add the reffects and finithing teints the method of letting the beautiful clear colours dry before we add the warm reflex and harmonizing teints prevents them from mixing and dirtying each other the principal blending colours ufed in the reffects are the vellow teint green teint and the rofe teint which laft is made of lake indian red and white find glazing the pearl and lead colours with white though it teems to anfwer our purpofe when it is done will cer- tainly fink and be loft in the grounds on which it is laid therefore we should make the dead-colouring as white as we intend the finifhing colours by reafon they will fink little in proportion to the colour of the cloth which the glazing with pure white only will recover land nds pe nd +ahe principal colours ufed in landichapes are fine white common white fine light oker brown oker brown pink burnt umber ivory black pruffian blue ultramarine terra-vert lake indian red

fine azure lighter azure light oker and white vermillion and white and teint made of white little vermillion and fome of the light azure landschapes should be painted on fort of tanned leather colour which is made of brown oker white and lightred this colour gives warmth to the shadow colours and is very agreeable and proper for glazing sketchinc or rubbing in the defign is the first work of the picture this should be done with burnt umber drove with drying oil and little oil of turpentine in faint flight fcumbling free manner as we shade with indian ink and water leaving the colour of the cloth for the lights as we do that of the paper remember in doing it we leave no part of the shadows to dark as we intend the firft lay or dead- colouring which is to be lighter than the finithing colours and though the foliage of the trees is only rubbed in with faint fort of scumbling yet the trunks and bodies should be in their proper shapes with their breadths of light and shadow all kinds of buildings should be done in the same manner leaving the colour of the cloth for their lights the vigures on the fore-ground if they are determined should alfo be sketched in the fame method and then left to dry of dead-colouring let the firft lay or dead-colouring be without any bright glaring or ftrong dark colours to that the effect is made more to receive and pre- ferve the finithing colours ithan to thew them in the firft painting the sky should be done firft then all the diftances and fo work downwards to the middle croup and from that to the fore-ground and reareft nds ch parts remember all the parts of each group as trees buildings or the like be all painted with the group they belong to the greateft secret in dead-colouring is to find the two colours which ferve for the ground of the shadows in general the sky excepted and the wethod of ufing them with the lights the firft of which is the dark-shade with little lake in it the other colour is only burnt um- ber thefe should be little changed to the natural hue of the objects and then laid and drove with drying oil in the fame manner as we shade with indian ink which is fcumbling kind of glazing and as fuch they should be left for otherwife they will be dark and heavy and there- fore would be intirely fpoiled for the finifhing glazing both thefe colours mix and fympathize agreeably with all the lights but should be laid before them when the landfchape is defigned begin with the sky which should be laid with good body of colours and left with faint refemblance of the principal clouds and this we should do more in the manner of claro obicuro than with finishing colours the whiter it is left the better it will bear out and fupport them the diftances should be made out faint and obicurely with the dark-shade and some of their lights in different degrees and laid fo as beft to find and shew their principal parts as we come more into the middle group we fall by degrees into the burnt umber in the shades all the grounds of the trees should be laid or rubbed in enough only to leave an idea of their shapes and shadows faintly the ground of their shadows muft be clean and lighter than their finithing colours fuch as will fupport their character and feem eafy to finith on in painting the lights it is better to incline more to the middle teint than to the very high lights and obferve to leave them with fufficient body of clean colours which will receive and preserve the finishing colours the better all which may he done with few teints after this go over the whole with the sweetener very lightly which will foften and mix the colours agreeably for finishing second and ch pe painting begin with the sky and lay in all the azure and colours of the hori- then foften them after that lay in the general teint of the clouds and finith on it with the high lights and the other teints that are want ing with light tender touches then foften the whole with the sweetener very lightly remember the finithing of the sky should be done all at once painting becaufe the tender character of the clouds will not do fo well as when the whole is wer obferve that the ftiffer the azure and colours of the horizon are laid the better the clouds may be painted upon them the greateff diftances are chiefly made with the colour of the sky and as they grow nearer and darker we should glaze and fcumble the parts very thin with fuch glazing shadow-colours as come neareft to the general hue of the group the objects are in this glazing should be underftood of darkith hue and that the firft painting or dead-colour should be feen through it diftinetly on this lay or ground we should ald the finishing colours now fuppoling this glazed ground is properly adapted to the object and place think then it will he cafy to find the other colours which are wanted for the lights and finishings of the fame but in laying them we muft take great care that we do not fpoil the glazing therefore we should be very exact in making thofe colours on the pallet and then be sure to lay them with light free touches before proceed any farther it will be proper to fay fomething of the moft ufeful glazing colours lake terra-vert pruffian and brown pink are the four principal the more we manage them like indian ink and the more diftinctly we leave them the better their tranfparent beauty will fland and appear pro- vided we do it with good drying oil after thefe four glazing colours burnt umber is very good glazing warin brown and of great ufc in the broken grounds and neareft parts but the moft agreeable colour for the nd pes darkeft shadows is the dark shade improved with lake it is fine warm shade when it is drove with drying oil no colour in the world is to sweet and fympathizing it mixes harmonioutly with all the lights as well as the shadows and is charming colour in the trunks and bodies of trees and in all kind of buildings we should make out all the ground of the objects with fuch glazing shadow-colours as feem neareft to the natural hue of the object in that situation but as the principal glazing colours themfelves are often too ftrong and glaring they should therefore be little changed and foftened with fuch colours as are of near refemblance to themielves and the objects thus if it is in the diftances the terra-vert and azure which are their principal glazing colours may be improved and mads lighter with fome of the sky teints and as the diftances come nearer with the purple as we get more into the middle group the terra- vert and pruffian may be changed with fome of the green teints fuch as are made without white for white is the destruction of all glazing colours as we approach the firft group there is less occafion for change- ing them but the fore-ground and its objects require all the strength and force of glazing which the colours are capable of producing after this glazing ground we should follow with firengthening the same in the shadows and darkeft places in fuch manner as will feem eaty to finith which is the firft lay of the second painting the colours that come next for finishing are in the degree of middle teints thefe should be carefully laid over the greateft breadth of lights in fuch manner as not to fpoil and cover too much of the glazing do it with good body of the colour as fliff as the pencil can agreeably manage to character remember the colours of the middle teint should be of clean beautiful hue according to thefe methods think it will be eafy to finith all the second painting as we work down from the sky through the middle group as we come to the firft croup where all the objects should appear perfectly finished we should finith their under or moft diftant parts before we paint any of the other which appear nearer obferve this method down to the laft and neareft objects of the picture and where it fo happens that painting one tree over another does rot ands ch pe pleafe forbear the second until the firft is dry thin near trees of different colours will do better if we let the under parts dry before we add the finifhing colours the third and laft painting if oiling is necefiary lay the leaft quantity that can be which should be done with stump-tool or pencil proportioned to the place that is to be viled to that we may oil no more than is wanted then wipe the whole place that is oiled with peice of silk handkerchief by this method we leave no more oil than is proper for our purpofe when we are going to finith any objects we should remember to ufe great variety of teints very near of the fame colour but moft of all when we are finishing trees this gives richness to the colouring and produces harmony find by experience the greens will fade and grow larker therefore it is highly neceffary to improve and force them by cxaggerating the lights and making an allowance in ufing them to much the lighter for the fame reafon we should take great care that we do not overcharge and fpoil the beauty of the glazing for if we do it will be dull and heavy and therefore will confequently grow darker the method for painting near trees is to make the firft lay very near to nature though not quite fo dark but more in the degree of middle teint and follow it with firengthening the shadows then the middle teints and laft of all lay the high lights and finifhing colours but all this can not be done as it should be at once painting therefore the beft way is to do no more than the firft lay with the faint shadows and leave it to dry then begin with improving the middle teints and shadows and let them dry the third and laft workis adding all the lightsand finifhing colours in the beft manner we are able this method of leaving the firft and fecond part to dry feparately not only makes the whole much eafier and more agreeable but leaves the colours in the greateft perfection becaufe nds ch pe moft of the work may be done with scumbling and glazing and fome parts without oiling the lights alfo may be laid with better body of colour which will not be mixed and spoiled with the wet ground what have faid of trees anfwers the fame to all kinds of shrubs and buthes the figures in landichape are the laft work of the picture thofe in the fore-ground should be done firft and thofe in the diftances next for after the figures in the firft and fartheft croup are painted think it will be much eafier to find the proportions of thofe in the middle parts of the picture and we should obferve that the shadows of the figures should be of the fame hue or colour with thofe of

and who have their utmoft to render them ufeful but for want of underftanding the art of painting and the practice of defign- ing they are intelligible only to thofe readers who have fufficient fund of geometry to comprehend all their schemes and examples they found that all planes were alike in geometry and followed their geo- metrical cenins which led them into fuch constructions as they thought would explain their properties in general and as they faid give new turn to pertpective indeed their schemes are to intricate that none but thofe who are well acquainted with the mathematicks can under- sland them dr. tayfor neglected the horizontal plane and in his book made no difference between that plane and any other whatfoever here it is that am quite of the reverfe opinion to that learned gentle- man and believe that the term of horizontal line should confine our notions to the horizontal plane and think that that plane which repretents the earth on which we live enjoys fome particular privileges which makes the figures in it more cafy and more convenient to be described notwithllanding all planes are alike in gcometry for which reafon pe ve have followed nature and have united the old and new prin- ciples and believing that objects are beft underftood rfom their narural appearance have given the horizontal plane to all my work with the vanithing line in its proper pofition here found it abfolutely neceffary to confider the subject in wanner as yet unattempted and which should require no mathematical knowlege to underfland it this obliged me to find one general method for the whole work and find- ing the principles few and fimple upon which the art depends and that there are no more than three planes and six different lines required to be underftood in order to reprefent any object whatfoever compoted such variety of objects as conceived would draw on the knowlege of perspective and which think can not fail of rendering the ufeful principles of this art general and intelligible moft gentlemen that have ftudied the mathematicks whom have talked with on perspective are for having mathematical demonftration of all the lineal parts of picture and will not allow that any thing can be right but what is done according to the pricleff rules and dr. taylor fays painter ought to govern himself intirely by the rules of perspective and not to take any liberties whatfoever confels am of their opinion and believe they are moft certainly right provided the picture was only the projection of any of the five solids were we to follow the rules in projecting the bafe and capital of column we should find thofe ufelefs operations too tedious and difficult for human patience and how we are to reprefent all sorts of objects according to the rules of perspective is to me as furpriting as impoflible painter is not to be confined strictly to the rules of perspective but to make them fublervient to his purpotes nothing should tie up his hands he should not have his genius imprifoned but be at liberty to express his idea like gyotro with one stroke of his pencil and as frefnoy fays let the compaffes be rather in his ryes than his hands there let him meafure diftinctly every object by compariton which is the principal talent of painter if he is well acquainted with the in- ciples of his art he will not stop at the dry rules of geometry whilff his fancy is fketching all the principal parts of the picture hle will proceed ve with the whole and then after the defign is fixed correct fuch parts as are requifice with the rules of perspective detign not to trouble the reader with multitude of examples but to explain the general rules of perspective in fuch manner as may be intelligible to him all my schemes are limited to fix plates only which are the subject of the fix different sorts of lines that reprefent all objects whatfoever and which are adapted to fuch objects as are eafy to be underftood and though delign to take the reader out of the common road will not lead him any round-about redious byc-ways as is often the cafc shall conduct him directly into fome beautiful garden where he may entertain himself with

interrupt or divide his attention uggerassessesesesesesegse pl te ficure vn order to explain the general rules of perspective let us fuppofe we lee the real objects as part of garden with fome distant prospects and between them and the spectator eye let us imagine trantparent plane as clats to be placed perpendicularly on the ground at the nearcht part of the objects on or thro which plane we fee their repretentations and it is with the affiftance of this imaginary planc that we are to undertland the principles and are fuppofed to produce the perspective projection or reprefentation the seat or line on which this plane flands is called the bafc-line line iil at the ilorizon is called the iforizontal linc the ileight or diftance this line is from the bafc-line is always equal to the leight of the kye of the spectator and is always drawn parallel to the batc-linc the tntet idtth faer tin parngon into delin scut latei per pe ve diftance which we are from the imaginary plane when at the station where we propofe to take the peripective view is the diftance of the picture the point of sight is the principal point in picture it is that point where line from the spectator eye cuts the imaginary plane at right angles and which always diftinguith with the letter the line is equal to the diftance of the picture and cuts the horizontal line at right angles as the principal ray does the imaginary planc therefore is the eyc-point becaufe it reprefents the fyc transferred from its firft pofition or point of view to the imaginary plane the next thing we are to confider is the ground-plane the ground-plane is that part which is below the bafe-line it is the plane whereon the plans of the geometrical or original objects are drawn though we are obliged to have the ground-plane below the baic- line yet the parts which are in it will be produced by the rules above it and as it were beyond it at diftance in perspective proportion as thofe in the ground-plane are diftant from the bafe-line we should remember that in order to reprefent any objects in per- spective it is neceffary that we underfland their geometrical plan eleva- tion profile and section before we attempt the perspective projection in the beginning of the work we should firft draw the bafe-line then affume point for the point of sight and draw the horizontal line through it make s equal to the diftance of the picture and defign the gco- metrical plan of the object in the ground-planc here the geometrical or original object is the point the repre- fentation of which is required to be found in the imaginary plane or firtt picture pe pe draw line from the given point to cut the bafe-line in any direcion at pleature as ab parallel to that draw line from the eyc- point to cut the horizontal line which gives the vanithing point for the reprefentation of the line ab here the line os is parallel to the line ab therefore will be the vanithing point draw the lines bs and a the interfection of which is the reprefentation fought the line ba is alfo the reprefentation of its original ba we may find the reprefentation of the seat or place where the pine- tree grows without ufing the original in the ground-plane thus bring down the diftance s to the horizontal line as sd and bring up ea to the bafc-line as bc which makes bc and sd parallel then line drawn from to will cut the line bs in therefore if we fuppofe the imaginary plane to be the picture and having affumed the line bs in which we fuppofe the pine-tree make bc on the poctom of the picture equal to the diftance we suppofe or know the tree is beyond the imaginary plane which diftance is commonly called the required diftance then the line cd will interfect bs which gives the reprefencation fought is the vanithing point of the original line ab becaufe the line ab vanithes in that point the reprefentation depends on the parallelifm of the lines os and ae for were they parallel in any other direction they would then project the point in the very jame place now after this explanation of the firft figure we should remember that the imaginary plane is to be underftood and called the picture fic let be five original points given in the ground- pione to find their reprefentations fir is the bate-lipne dv the horizontal line the point of sight id the diftance of the picture ivc tuttead of drawing the lines from the points in any direction draw two parallel lines thro four of the points to the bafc-line pe ve and as which will fhorten the work then draw their parallel ov from the eyc-point to cut the horizontal line which will give the vanithing point draw gv and yv and interfect them with the rays c and d which give the reprefentations the points and are in line that is parallel to the bafc-line the repretentation of which muft be parallel to the bafe-line alfa which being interfected by the ray co gives the point then will the points be the reprefentation of the original points the projection fought we may find their reprefentation without ufing the ground-plane thus ering down the diftance of the vanithing point to the hori- zontal line as and bring up the lines cbg and day to the bafe- line then draw lines from them to the point which will interfect the lines and yv in the sfame points as may be feen by the line vh all circles and curve-lined figures are reprefented by finding feveral points in them and then joining them neatly by hand therefore we should affume in the original lines only to many points as are abfolutely neceffary and in fuch manner as may be eafy for the work of the pro- jection frc is the method of dividing the vifual line es into any number of parts as the trees coc let be the bafc-line the point of sight s the diftance of the picture and sd that diftance brought to the horizontal line and let the line es be required to be divided into given number of parts equal to fe firft bring up the given space fe to the bafc-line as and draw the line which interfects es in the point or the seat of the firtt tree inftead of continuing the divilions on the bafe-line we may draw line from the firft divition to the point of sight and by making the line parallel to er we have new scale of the space at its place in the picture therefore all the reft are found by this repetition plate pe pec ve te ii fic lines that interfect or cut the picture at right angles are aa called direct lines which lines will vanish in the point of sight therefore we fee rows of trees or the like which are in parallel lines contract

the vanifhing line de till the eyc-point is directly oppofite to the point of sight then they would be in vifual plane which pafies from the spectator eye parallel to the ground-plane the interfection of which plane with the imaginary plane or picture is the vanithing line of that plane or hori- zontal linc lines which are drawn from the eyc-point to the horizontal line producing the vanithing

confider the plane of the picture as ceiling thefe objects which are laid on the ground will then appear perpendicular to the plane of the ceiling this fort of perspective is eaty becaufe the

the other sides are in vertical planes which vanith in the vifual point the plan is thewn by the diagonal to it is obvious from this figure that all objects which are parallel to the picture can- not alter nor change their shapes for if we fuppofe lines continued from all the parts to the vanishing point and that they were cut by plane in vertical and parallel direction to the picture yet then

then be exactly fimilar as may be underftood by thefe objects imagine from the principles which have already laid down the reader will be inclined to believe that the reprefentation of objects may be projected without the ground plane for if we underftand the original why should we not ufe the fame rules at the part of the object in the picture where the projection is required as if it was below

will be its center and vo its diftance make ve per- pendicular to the vanithing line ghi and equal to its diftance vo then at the point make the geometrical angle of inclination as veii which gives ii the vanithing point of the inclination draw ec per- pendicular to eii which makes in that vanithing line the vanithing point of lines perpendicular to ii next draw the vanithing line phi and make sd parallel to it and equal to the diftance of the picture then from the point of sight draw line to cut the vanithing line pii at right angles which gives the center and id the distance of that vanishing line here it is obvious in this projection that the lines pii and pc are the three vanishing lines of the feveral faces of figure which con- tain folid right angle it is alfo very plain that the line eii according to thefe rules muft be the geometrical of the original inclined plane therefore if we make eb equal to the end or thickness of the block then will be the seat of as on the horizontal plane to proceed with the projection make ab in the plane of the picture equal to ab then will the point be the neareft angle of the block next we should make equal to id and draw the lines pk and hk that generate square angle which is equally divided by the line ke make bl equal to the length of the block and parallel to the vanishing line pil draw line from to the distance of which will give the side bn drawnhi and the diagonal be and thro their interfections draw line from which gives the upper side next draw the line b which gives bc the neareft edge and draw the lines bp cp and bil ch then the line ng and one from the angle above to will finish the whole reprefentation or projection of the block have pe ve have endeavoured to thew in the progrets of all the schemes that the principles on which the whole art depends are to fimple that it is ohvious the method is general to all planes alike firft of the horizontal plane the distance of the picture muft be placed from the center or point of sight perpendicular to its vanishing line before we can make the generating angles which give the vanish- ing points then we may bring down their diftances to the horizontal line provided the dimentions of the original are brought parallel to them as have thewn in the courfe of the work secondly of the vertical plane the diftance of the vanishing line is placed perpendicular to it and from the eye-point proceed the gene- rating lines that give the vanishing points the diftance of which are uted and brought to the vanifhing line in the fame manner as thofe of the horizantal plane and the inclined plane has its diftance placed perpendicular to the vanifhing line and from the eyc-point proceed the generating lines and angles which produce the vanithing points and which are alfo brought to the vanithing line and ufed as thofe of the horizontal the method of finding the center of vanithing line is only to draw line from the point of sight to cut or interfect the vanithing line at right angles which interfection will be the center of that vanishing line the general rule for finding the distance of vanithing line is always to make the diftance of the picture from the point of sight parallel to that vanithing line and to draw line from that to the center of the vanithing line which will be the diftance of that vanifhing line as di is to the vanishing line pil or ov to that of gii to find the perspective reprefentation of circles we are obliged to make plan of the circle or part of the plan by adding fuch lines to it as may cafily be projected and leave clear idea of the required circlc fic let be the point of sight dand the points of diftance and kl mn the scheme of the plan the per pec ve moft exact and cafieft method is to inclofe the circle with square and then make the two diameters and diagonals which give the eight required points but inflead of drawing lines thro the points of the diagonals parallel to the sides of the square make them parallel to the diagonals this method gives the fame points with the lines nearer to the circle than can be drawn by any other method whatfoever the reft of the figure needs no demonftration frc shews the method of making the plan of the circles in order to find the perspective reprefentation of the torus which have done according to my method juft thewn of drawing circles and which may be underftood very eafily at sight of this figure the perspective of the torus feems to be circle contained in four lines which are nearer or farther diftant from each other according to the situation of the eye two of which are perpendicular to the hori- plane thefe give the greateft breadth of the torus the other two are parallel to that plane and give the height and depth the one is the upper and fartheft part of the circle the other the neareft and bottom part of the torus the two perpendicular lines proceed from the ex- tremity of the circle in the plan which are found from the projection of the two eight oppofite parts thofe that give the height and depth are governed by the perspective section of the bafe which is in the vertical plane frc ig is the diagonal scale which is of univerfal ufe for trant ferring all sorts of defigns to the greateft exactness and to eaty to under- tland that one demonftration is fufficient for every artift who will imagine find no manner of difficulty in applying it to practice suppofe to reprefent one foot in the defign which we are to work from and ac to be the intended length of one foot in that which we are going to make the method is firft to take the dimentions of the part we propofe to begin with then to place the compaffes to the bafe-line of the scale aid pec find what it is in the line de then open them to that in the line dc which will be the required length thus the reprefentation is found by feet and inches becaute the bafe-line da contains twelve parts which confequently divide the length ab and ac on the lines db and dc into that number by this method we may make the scale to any proportion and as it is the bufiness of every artift to find proper scale for his purpofe there- fore painters are not obliged to ufe always fuch scales as the work was wrought to suppofe we draw the pedeftal without ufing the method of feet and inches divide the whole height into any convenient number of equal parts and let one of thofe be for the scale then divide the height we intend to make the pedeftal of in the fame manner and apply them to the method of the scale which will antver our purpofe as well it is fometimes neceffary in copying to divide the original into number of squares and then divide the cloth for the copy the fame if in one of the squares at the corner of the cloth we make the scale according to this method we may ufe them as we did the scale of feet and inches the number in the bafe of the scale is at our pleafure remember to make the squares very large for none but novices make them otherwife fic is method which have often found to be of great ofe and very eafy to practife when we are little ufed to it suppofe the line ac to be the height of any defign we have to work from and the line bb the intended height of that which we are going to make draw the bafe cb then place the defign perpendicular to it as an bb oc and draw line from through to cut the bafe which will give the center pe ve the line ac be divided into any number of parts and we draw lines from the genter cthrough them to cut the line bb then will they divide the line bb in the fame manner exactly therefore if the line ag was the axis of column and entablature the same may be transferred to the height we would have it by having fmall nail in the center and fine thread fuch as the wig-makers weave with and only strain the fame over the parts in aa to bb which will give the required dimenfions in the fame manner we may have all the breadths by applying them to the line ac and continuing them to the line bb or if it is only few of them as the diameters they may be done feparately but remem- ber that after the places of the lines ag and bbare fixed they muft con- tinue fo till the whole is finished the antique figure in the fixth plate marked with the letter is an object have studied with great application and care in order to project it exactly according to the rules of perspective and as improved in the knowlege of the new principles flattered myfelf should fucceed believing if larrived at fuch perfection in the art should then be able in time to reprefent all objects whatfoever as fome of the learned in the mathematicks will have it according to the pricteff rules who dogma- tically affert that every part of the perspective should be mathematically true when we fancy this to be really the cafe it is reafonable to believe that we should be anxious to learn an art which we think fo abfolutely necef- fary now gentle reader muft confels my weakness and tell you that notwithftanding all my care and puzzling after this mathematical truch find the uundertaking was too great for my capacity and therefore from the experience of my folly determined to give up the attempt and flatter myfelf no farther with fuch expectations but whenever the rules which have shewn should fail and grow tedious which believe will not happen in matters of confequence defign immediately to fettle the affair at sight of the object the er volutes in the capitals of columns and the twift in stair-cafes are objects of this nature and very probably were taken from this an- tique it has alfo great refemblance to nr hegarth precise serpentine line and therefore without doubt has fome grace though the twift is little quicker it is an object of well-varied contents whofe pro- portions gradually leften to its extremities and its dimenfions are governed by fitness variety oniformity simplicity intricacy and quantity what pity it is this venerable object of antiquity should not be reprefented by the rricteff rules of perspective confels this would afford matter of triumph to any learned critic that is happy enough to fucceed in the attempt in purfuance of our prefent inquiry fuppofe according to certain chimerical new syftem the object under our confideration be imagined to have all its inward contents nicely fcooped out and the eye at once to view the whole from within and mark the oppofite corresponding parts and take care to acquire perfect idea of the diftances and bearings of their feveral material points and lines in the surfaces or for the more caty description of the projection fuppofe we were to gauge the contents with wires in order to affift and guide us to readier conception of all the intervening parts leave it to the critics to judge of what ufe thefe expedients are towards raifing in the imagination true and perfect idea of the antique in queftion the pamphlet intituled critical examination of the paintings on the coiling of the banqueting-house at white-hall thews that that celebrated ceiling has nine feparate points of sight and that no painting can appear perfectly true unless feen from the point intended by the painter and though picture may be perfectly true from one certain point of view it can not from any other therefore the author has taken great care to thew the neceffity of regarding picture as intended by the painter the picture he fays being always considered as transparent surface or medium through which the visual rays are supposed to pass if the spec- tafor changes bis situation those rays in nature will interfett that sur- face per pec ve in different points and therefore in the pitture being determined to such certain points the station of the spectator becomes neceffarily sixed and unalterable and the picture must appear falfe seen otherwife suppofe we fee through window or tranfparent plane real cube placed directly oppofite tho fomewhat below the eye in this situation we shall fee only two faces one in front and the other at top and if we move to the right or left we muft fee one of the other faces this ishis proposition which is certainly true in order to underftand the principles of perspective we are obliged to confider the picture as tranfparent plane thro which the vifual rays pats to the spectator ’ eyc but when the defign is really picture whofe reprefentation is fixed upon fome opaque body as board wall or painted cloth that can not be tran parent but flat fmooth surface and the object reprefented is cube that thews only two faces one in front and the other at top tho we move to the right or left from the point of sight we shall never fee more by changing the place nei- ther is it reafonable to believe we should for if we find the fame appear- ance tho moved from the point intended by the painter the cafe is not altered which thews there is no neceffity of having the eye of the spectator exactly in that identical point if the spectator eye muft coincide with the point of sight the distance should be confidered accordingly and it will then be very difficult mac- ter to come at the proper point of view to fee the picture and the more fo as its horizon when hung up is feldom fo low as the eye own the sight of the pamphlet excited my curiofity to examine the ceiling and find the centre of the whole to be the only point of sight requifite in all that noble defign for from the middle of the room faw the intention of that great painter and was convinced of it from the order of the whole and by the natural pofition of the figures which appeared all finely forefhortened and looked like fuch living objects viewed from the middle of the room below which was in my opinion the principal point of view that rubens intended for the whole ceiling iam pe .ve am alfo of opinion that allceilings except thofe of galleries or long rooms should have but one point of sight and that there are some subjects which believe require no point of sight as living objects reprefented in the clouds which have no architecture nor any terreftrial appearance which is the cafe with moft of the work in this ceiling and if there is no point of sight required in the work of the picture then think there is none in regard to its being truty seen becaufe the kye can not coincide with the point that never was made or intended it was not material to take notice of the moft dry and lifeless part of the performance expected mr. highmore would have given us some ingenious remarks on the forefhortenings of the figures and of the excellence of the colouring which prefume would have been more agreeable to his readers than telling them that rubens was little deficient in an art which was never underftood as he might have faid till this century but it is reafonable to believe if his leifure had permitted him to examine the whole he would have found much to commend and very little to cenfure as it may be expected that should fay fomething of the perspective of shadows shall only observe that the geometrical or perspective know- lege of shadows is of very little confequence to painter it is eafily underftood when we have learned that of the objects but in my opinion painters may pare themfelves the trouble of learning the lineal perspec- tive of shadows becaufe their bufiness is to fhun every thing of that nature in picture all the limits and shapes of shadows should vanish every part that is hard and edgy cuts and offends the eyc having now given my readers the beft infight in my power to the practice of painting and perspective hope they will excufe the size of this treatife which it has been my study from its first projection to con- fine to as narrow limits as poftible being from experience convinced that an art if properly can not be too concifely described therefore am forry could not from the nature of the subjects reduce it to shorter orleffer work line afier do ir read in laft after
