the principles of design for the curious young gentlemen and ladies who study and practise the noble and commendable art or drawing colouring and japanning or new and complete drawing-book consisting of variety of whole figures in divers positions and all the several parts of the human body from head to foot in fifty copper-plates neatly engraved designed chiefly for young beginners very neceffary and useful for all drawing schools boarding-schools to which is prefixed an introduction to drawing containing description of the instruments and their respective use and the materials proper for drawing rules for managing the pencil and the best method for attaining perfection in the art with instructions by which young practitioner shall be enabled to form judgment as well of his own performances as those of others with easy proper and necessary lessons for him at his first entrance also the names of the colours used with instructions to temper and mix them and fit them for painting likewise colours for washing landskips or prinis of any kind translated from the french of monsieur gerrard de lairesse london printed for serjeant ’ at the black swan near temrle-bar four shillings introduction none of the arts which have been invented for the use or amusement of man kind can boast so great number of admirers as that of drawing and very justly for it gives such an agreeable representation of things that we are apt to fancy we see objects which have no real existence and that the imagery before us which is no more than painted cloth actually breathes the whole creation with all its works and wonders comes within the power of its imitation it fets before us things long since buried in oblivion exhibits to perfect view the most noted actions of people who have bcen long in their graves and shews us our ancestors in perfect resemblance of their feature through several successive generations that therefore youth may be instructed how to attain good degree of perfection in the art we shall prescribe the best rules we are able at least such as we apprehend are absolutely necessary for their information after which we shall give them some very useful and pertinent instructions for their better understanding of this art rules for the direction of the young practitioner in the art of drawing it is highly necessary for him who would draw well to understand what is truly good and beautiful in draught in order to which the most expeditious method will be to comparc prints and draughts together many painters have grievoully miscarried by satisfying themselves only wich imitating bad pieces without giving any scope to their own genius or improving their knowledge in judging of the beauties and defects of picture the ideas in our minds may in great measure serve us for model but the labour of the hand must indeed aid and assist that of the brain for whoever would be an able artist must by continual practice make the art habitual the rules of all arts are soon learned but to attain perfection in any of them long prac tice and strict attention are absolutely requisite it is true maxim that laziness was never the parent of any thing excellent drawing is not attainable but by length of time or perfection in it acquirable unless the hand be frequently employed in the practice and the mind in judging every day should produce something and the hand give frequent proofs of thie speculations of the head he who proposes to gain an entrance into minerva ’ cabinet must make his approach es gradually thus in the art of drawing though the representation of the human figure or many figures in piece be the principal object which every practitioner has chiefly in view yet he must not make this his first essay but procced to this by proper and regular steps let the first part of his study be to draw streight and curved lines square round regular irregular and inanimate figures also parts of human figures as the eye the ear the hand feet this will be good foundation whereon to erect his future structure for by this means he will acquire readiness of hand freedom and exactness in drawing lines and accustom himfelf to the exercise of his patience qualifications absolutely necessary for one who would be esteemed an exact copier of nature especially in pieces that require length of time and more than or dinary skill in the performance the out-lines are the circumferent strokes of figure the perfection of good out line consists in the freedom and boldness of the stroke and the due proportion of all its parts to attain which the scholar is admonished to reject all mean and trifling prac tices such as tracing the original through oil paper or making use of thin paper for the same purpose or taking advantage of any artificial light the use of such deceptions will certainly prevent all progress and improvement in drating for some time at first be satisfied with practising upon good out-line without aim ing at finished piece nor is it necessary that you should as yet hatch or shade your own draught your out line at first must be sketched with flight and faint touches that you may have an opportunity to amend it where proper which will have the less appear ance of being retouched in every stroke endeavour an exact imitation and when ever you mend the out-line either by taking away little of its parts or by swelling the others be sure to lose nothing of the freedom and boldness of it mind frequently to compare your copy with the original take particular notice of what is amiss and let not the least fault escape uncorrected that so in the draught which you may afterwards make the same original these errors may be avoided for you must pass from one original to another 'till you are in good degree master of the first the best and surest method of practice is to make great number of sketches of the same figure in each of which endeavour to excel what you did in the former in your first operations procecd slowly for hasty productions are seldom beautiful or correct and the design is often thus spoiled in the first attempt it is no easy matter to amend bad habits expedition in performance is acquired by constancy in practice when you fit down to work and all the time you are at it take strict and close view of your original and in your mind divide it into several parts take due notice of the length breadth and similitude of each part observe the proportion of each to the other and to the whole the distances between the parts and the parts that lie parallel or are exactly opposite to each other when you have finished your copy and laid aside both example and draught let your mind be employed for some time on other affairs then return to it again and view your work afresh and very probably you will discover faults which did not appear to vou before let your out-lines be large and smooth and drawn in flowing gliding manner for if they are too fsreight they will carry disagrecable stiffness but if drawn according to this direction they will have the resemblance of life and motion and appear with an easy grace in all your draughts let there be perfect relation between the parts and the whole and uniformity run through the whole piece that is let every member be made for its own head and agree with it you must not put strong limbs to body that is confump tive or to old age in its decay nor must you be less exact in pairing the eyes hands legs and feet for the least disproportion will be blemish and when any of the limbs are not proportionate to the rest when you draw the muscles take care to insert them according to the rule of anato my they must not be crouded into small sections but kept as entire as possible and only the principal muscles expressed in member which is to express any particular force they must be shewn large as in the leg when it supports the body or in the arm when it lifts weight and be more swelled than in any other members the materials proper for drawing the materials necessary for this purpose are either pencils of black lead or black lead fixed in porcrayon charcoal chalk black red and white pastils or crayons pens hair pencils and indian ink nothing is more proper for beginners to practise with than black lead in drawing plain lines especially as this makes smoother stroke than can be done by charcoal or crayons cut your lead with penknife 'till you have brought it to fine point that it may give it neat small stroke or you may fix piece of the same lead in porcrayon but whatever it is you sketch with use yourself to hold it long-ways in your hand and let your fingers be much farther from the point than the nib of pen is when you write and let your strokes be formed with light gentle touches thus will you gradually acquire ready command of hand and you will with ease make your out-line free and bold in practising after limbs and figures it will be proper at first to draw the rough sketch with charcoal which is more easily discharged from paper than black lead slit your charcoal in small flender pieces one of which fix in porcrayon the better to hold it then sharpen it to point and lightly but correctly sketch out your original when vou have so done if there is any thing you mislike in the performance you may easily wipe it out by brushing it with feather or clean rag when you have secured your out-iines with charcoal procced thus take feather and wipe them slightly over with it that it may appear faint then go over the line with black or red-lead and cor rect them where ever you can if after all this you still see any errors to amend take bit of crumb of stale white loaf with which you may discharge any part of it you please by rubbing it therewith you may use red-lead or red or black chalk in the same manner as black-lead if in heightnings or when you would give strong lights or draw on coloured paper use white chalk and tobacco pipe clay pistils and crayons are terms which perhaps the learner may not readily understand they are colours mixed up with tobacco pipe clay which must be worked into paste and rolled up into the thickness of quill two or three inches long and then dried when fit for use the artilt works them on coloured paper but not in hatchings as black and red-iead commonly are the colours are rubbed and worked together so that there is no single stroke but the whole appears as if only brush had been used the crayons is very expeditious manner of drawing and when skilfully handled always produce delicate softness and fine expression however it must be observed that the careless or rude touch of linger may at once blot out all the beauties of this fine work to prevent which let it be preserved in books or in frame under glass the crayons will be worked more easily if the grain of the paper be little rough and be expressed more strongly than when the paper is quite smooth or if the paper be some what dark or brownish or what they call whited-brown it will give relief to the ten der part of the work by shewing the light strokes of it in shading draughts sometimes pens are used for hatching the cross strokes however the hair pencil and indian ink serve much better for this use which are not only proper for hatching by strokes but for shading by method much more expeditious that is by washing which is the same way of working as with hair pencils and water colours in hatching the shades arc produced by lines not unlike the strokes whlich shade print engraved but in washing no lines appcar but the shades shew themselves like those in metzotinto print of the tints of lights and shadows ilghts and shades when judiciously disposed give the appearance of substance nature and distance to such bodies as the pencil represents suppose for instance circle drawn on piece of paper imagine you see it fill up with any even colour you can conceive of it no otherwise than as round flat equal body but if you put the strongest of the colour in the middle and weaken it gradually towards the extre mities you will perceive an agrecable deception and instead of flat even body it will have the resemblance of ball or globe wherever the colour appears the most lively there the object catches the eye first and seems nearest to it but where the colour weakens and goes off it grows faint and at length seems to fly off and break away from the fight thus the painter by breaking and diminishing his colours throws that behind which he has mind shall be less visible when you round the parts of an object it requires the nicest touch of the pencil to draw the extremities so as that in turning they shall lofs themselves insensibly and con fusedly without too sudden transltion of the light into the shadows or of the sha dows into the light but let the one pass into the other as it were reciprocally and im perceptibly that is by degrees of light into shadow and shadow into light when your objects are to be painted light you must allow due breadth of shadow to sustain them if dark sudden light must rise behind them to separate them from the ground or from other objects that are placed behind them or else they will appear as if they were sticking upon each other in confused manner whereas by just oppo sition of light to shade and shade to light projection is given which makes se paration of the objects you must keep proper ballance between light and shadows and introducing broad light into your draught you must give it large shadow you must make your light serve as repose to the darks and the darks to the lights it should be farther observed in regard to lights and shades that it is not enough that remote objects be coloured in more faint and languid manner but the more or less distant they are the parts should appear more or less confused the eye can not minutely discriminate an object which is at distince from it we can see human figures at street length but can not discern the features of their faces or the plaits in their cloat is so the innumerable leaves of dsitant grove appcar to the light but as one mass in the representation of bodies you must always give them such lights as are most proper and convenient for their supposed situations suppose the objects before you in the fields or open air and the sun obscured with clouds your business is to introduce an universal light though not vivid or strong you shades too must be faint but when the sun appears in all its glory your lights must then be very strong and bold and the shadows exceeding dark suppose again that the object you represent is in room little though not very much illuminated and to survey it you take your station without and stand level with the light that slrikes upon it that figure must have very soft shadows which will shew it very beautifully and though the shadow be so soft yet the figure will seem as if it were embossed and have very bold appearance when small light illuminates body the shadows on the dark side appear large and their extremities very bold whereas large light renders the shadows on the darker side more distinct and much softer than their limitations useful instructions for the young practitioner he that would be perfect master in the art of drawing must learn to sketch well to which therefore be ought to give the greatest attention in copying statue some persons begin with the head which they entirely finish before they pro cecd any farther by which means it frequently happens that they either make the head too little or too big and the other part so disproportionate that there is but small re semblance of the original occasioned cheifly through want of duly observing distances when therefore you have any thing to draw let your first care be to divide it into its different parts then measure the distances in the original wich your eye mark the distances and length of each division with faint line on your paper and make sketch of the whole figure before you proceed to finish any part of it so will you secure the pro portions in the exactest manner the learner will find among these examples several draughts of the parts of the face as the eyes nose mouth viewed in different positions all wlich he should practice upon before he attempts whole face for which purpose we shall lay down such lessons and instructions concerning an oval with its several changes and varia tions and of the cross in the same as will enable him to figure all bowings and re turnings reclinations and inclinations of all forts of faces the head you are to observe has the shape and form of an egg or oval this head has eyes eye-brows nose and ears which must be placed in their proper situ ations by running cross through the oval by this means you will divide the per pendicular in the oval into four equal parts which will make the head measure four noses in height the face three only the diameter crossing the perpendicular divide into five parts cach being the breadth or wideness of one eye this diameter is called the ocular line or that whereon the eyes are to be placed you must therefore draw streight line from the top of the right car through both eyes to the top of the left ear and the line drawn from the top of the head down through the nose mouth and chin is called the perpendicular crossing the diameter or ocular-line at right angles these lines together we call the cross of the oval upon which cross what ever situation the face is in you must place the eyes nose mouth and ears in proper places when you understand this thoroughly and have fixed it in your mind you will soon be able to draw good faces our of your own fancy and invention and execute them in masterly manner but if you accustom yourself to draw only after print draught er picture without knowing the use of the cross-lines and the proportion of face wich its parts you take wrong method don know what you are about and will never attain to any degree of perfection having thus instructed you in the several methods of drawing face we come now to give you the dimensions and proportions of the several parts of the body it was cuslomary with the antients to allow eight heads to their figures though some of them have only seven the moderns usually divide figure into ten faces taking it at the crown of the head and ending at the sole of the foot thus from the crown of the head to the forehead is the third part of the face the face takes its beginning at the root of the lowest hairs on the forehead and it end is at the bottom of the chin painters divide the face into three proportional parts namely the forehead the gose the mouth and chin the distance from the chin to the pit betwixt the collar-bones measures two lengths of nose from the same pit to the bottom of the breast one face from thence to the navel onc face from the navel to the privities one face the distance from the genitals to the upper part of the knece two faces the knee itself measures half face measure from the lower part of the knee to the ancle and you will lind it two faces from the ancle to the sole of the foot is half face when man stretches out his arms as wide as he can line drawn from the top of the longest finger of the right hand to the top of the longest finger on the left will measure the length of his whole body or he will find himfelf as broad as he is long the distance from side to side of the breasts two faces the bone of the arm called humerus from the shoulder to the elbow measures to faces the bonce called cubitus with part of the head measuring from the tip of the elbow to the root of the little finger contains two faces from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the collar-bones is onc face in taking the measurement of the breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other to see if it be equal to the length of the body you are to observe that the boxes of the elbows with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulder-blade bear the proportion of half the face when the arms are stretched out the sole of the foot measures the fixth part of the figure the hand is the length of the face the thumb of the nose from the place where tle pectoral muscle or that muscle which makes the breast disappears to the middle of the arm measures four noses carry your measure from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand you will find it five noses your longest toe is the length of your nose the tops of the two nipples and the pit betwixt the two collar-bones make an equilateral triangle these farther rules are to be observed in drawing hend viz you must fet the eyes at such distance from one another that you may place one between them the mouth when shut has the dimensions of an eye the cars are always on level with the eyes -top and below with the nose whether ie be short or long the nostril should be placed exactly against the corner of the eye in face that is flat the checks swell out and once that is lean the cheeks fall in and the jaw-bones stand out having finished our instructions for the drawing of the face let us now procced to draw man at full length in the first place you must make your oval then divide as before directed you then draw perpendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot which you must divide into eight lengths this will be good direction in placing your figure upright or in whatever action the posture requires whether it either falls in or swells out you must make the length of one head between the chin and che breast the third measure must reach to the navel the fourth from thence to the genitals the fifth to the middle of the thigh the sixth comes to the lower part of the knee the seventh to the lower part of the leg and the last reaches to the heel or sole of the foot in every measure or division you must take particular notice what touches there are of the muscles the leg must be first drawn on which the body slands then the other after which draw the arms and hands you must first draw all the parts very lightly only with coal because that will give you the leafs trouble in rubbing out or altering the hands you must observe are twice as long as broad and each of their parts has its particular length breadth and thickness the nail of the finger makes about half the joint it is upon the length of the foot mensures the sixth part or height of man or five eights more in length than in breadth take notice that the length of the face and hands are exacly equal and is just the tenth part of person height having thus instructed you to draw complete man we shall in the next place lay down some rules for drawing of children some will have the length of child to contain five measures of the head as thus from the top of the head they make three and the thighs and legs two more the breadth between the shoulders is the length of one head and half the breadth of the body above the navel the length of one head and the breadth of the thickest part of the thigh is one third of two lengths of the head the breadth of the knee measures exactly the distance between the eyes and the chin the brawn of the arm and small of the leg are just the thickness of the neck if you take the proportion of child slanding backward you will find it of the fame meafure as the former rules for filling up empty figures when with your charcoal you have drawn the out-lines you must retouch them with your red-lead crayon and then with feather brush away the dirtiness of the charcoal when you have donc that you must retouch with gentle hand such places as have been fouled in the rubbing as the hair eyes mouth fingers toes out-lines let me also caution you that in those out-lines which are open to day you make your strokes very light but strong in those which are darkened thus will the out-lines appear in natural manner and add wonderful beauty and grace to human fgures and all other objects when this is done you must begin the shades wich single hatching but pretty strong you begin it at the top proceeding insensibly to the bottom as evenly in the distance as you possibly can you then go on to the roundings which you must also express by single strokes wich such light as the object before you requires be cautious not to make your shadows too hard or dark at first if you would present the perspective in the best manner begin the shadows lightly and faintly and heighten them afterwards and you will soon be pleased with the agreeable effect instructions bow to draw after picture model or the life when you have got picture to draw after be sure to place it in goodl ight so that the sight of your eye and the light of the day may fall together on the pic ture place yourself at moderate distance according to the largeness or smallness of the picture at least no farther off than that you may with glance of your eye see the whole picture at once for the larger the picture is at thie greater distance you must fit to draw it be careful likewise to place your print exactly right before you and let it not lie down flat for if it be laid flat you will quickly see the figures in it fore-shortned the paper you draw upon you must lay five or six times double upon pinnel board set in your lap and raised as high as you can with your knees or let it be rested on form or stooping desk so that your work may stand upon one end before you thus will you be enabled to judge of the similitude between your draught and the original which it will be impossible for you to do if it lies flat before you the next thing you have to do is to guess as near as you can at the middle of the thing you have to draw whether picture or any other matter then mark it on your paper with the point of your coal when you have done this look for the largest figure if there happens to be more than ione and touch them lightly in proper places and so all that is in the picture you will then presently discover whether your guessing and sketching be true or not but besides this before you draw stroke be sure you do it with good reason and observation and be very careful about the great and general parts and meddle not with the small break ings 'till the next sketching and by constantly practising in this manner you will in sensibly acquire facility and judgment in your work another rule you are to observe is always to begin on the right side of the figure for so you have the first stroke conslantly in your eye and the rest will naturally follow and give less trouble but if you begin on the left side your hand covers the object from your sight having thus made rough sketch you should carefully review and examine it and see if it be done according to art and if the action of the figure or figures in it be answerable to the original now as actions are the life of picture they must shew themselves in the first draught however rude it be or you can never expect it will be happily finished you must then correct your sketch and improve it in neatness and air by adding and diminishing as you see proper as you may easly do with your charcoal but in doing this be mindful that you don spoil the first good action in it which may easily be done if you don well observe the movements of the several parts if you can always make choice of north light for your situation because it is less variable than any other should you fit at south window you will find it proper to place sash of oiled paper before it which will break the intenseness of the fun rays and diffuse them more equally without any sensible variation the next thing you have to do is to put your figure whether it be the life or model in proper position the best light is that which is high and equally diffused not too strong nor glaring when objects are so dilposed you see all their beauties and the minutest parts show themselves to advantage for drawing the face when you have drawn the circle of the face which you must do at first with plain circular line without making any bending or indentures in or out make stroke from that place of the forehead which is even with the chin down the place where you intend to fix the middle of the nose and the middle of the mouth this stroke you must observe must be struck that way which the face should turn either to one side or straight down which stroke will be great help to you in placing the features rightly so that they may not stand awry but directly one under another now if the face turn downward the stroke must be struck in such manner that the eyes may turn answerable with the face downwards when you have done that make another stroke for the length of the nose where the end of it should come and another stroke for the mouth that it be not made crooked still observing to make all the strokes to turn one way up or down according as the face turns that is if the face turns up or down the eyes nose and mouth mult turn with it when you have made these strokes ex actly procced to place the features according to the preceding rules in the face is usually observed this threefold proportion from the top of the forehead to the eye-brows from the eye-brows to the bottom of the nose thence to the bottom of the chin this proportion however is not constantly the same for in some persons the forehead is lower than in others the nose of some longer and in some shorter than others and therefore this rule can only be observed in well proportioned face the distance between the two eyes is juft the length of one eye if in full face but if it turn any thing aside then that distance is lessened according ly the nostril ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the mouth mult be always placed between the eyes and the chin just under the nose as the greateft difficulty and principal part of the art lies in the lively drawing of the face shall add these farther directions to perfect you in this particular branch of your art first if you would draw face exactly so as to resemble the original you draw it from you must in the first place take notice of the physiognomy or circumference of the face whether it be long or round fat or lean big or little that so you may be sure to draw the physiognomy or bigness of the face right if it be fat face you will perceive the checks to make the fide of the face swell out and so make the face look as it were square if it be lean face the jaw-bone will stick out and the checks fall in and the face will look long and slender if it be neither too fat nor too lean the face will for the most part be round when you draw the utmost circumference of face you must take in the head and all with it otherwise you may be deceived in drawing the true bigness of the face secondly you must carefully and judiciously observe and discern all the master touches which give life to face or discover the grace or disposition of the mind in which lies the whole graces of the work and the credit of the workman thus smiling countenance is easily discern in the mouth when the corners of it are little turn' up frowning countenance in the forehead eye-brows bending and the top of the nose between the eyes somewhat wrinkled sober and staid countenance is best discerned in the eye when the upper eye-lid comes somewhat over the ball of the eye laughing countenance is easily discerned all over the face and so is an angry wrathful countenance by extraordinary frowning there are also qome touches about the eyes and mouth which give life and spirit to face which you will by degrees find out by frequently observing and imitating the works of the best masters further rules for the young praclitioner in drawing your charcoal being neatly sharpen you must in the drawing of face first lightly draw the out-stroke or circumference of the face exactly ac cording to the bigness of the pattern making it to sland fore-right or to turn upwards or downwards according to your pattern then make some little touches where the features namely the eyes nose mouth chin should be placed not drawing them exactly at the first when you have thus lightly pointed out the features then begin to draw them more exactly and so proceed 'till the face be finished which being done then add the beard and other things about it in drawing side-face you need not at first draw the nose mouth and chin that stand in the outmost line but only make it first but bare circumference turning this way or that way according to the pattern and then make the mouth nose and chin in their places and just proportion you must be sure to place the muscles in the right and proper places by the muscles mean all the shadows that are caused by some dents or swellings in the face and be able to find out the reason of every muscle that so you may procced to work with the more judgment the muscles will be most visible in an old wither' face and you must first draw the most principal of them and then you only draw the more ealily the lesser within be sure to be very exact in the placing of them or you will spoil your draught be it ever so good observe to make the shadows rightly and be careful not to make them too dark where they should be faint or if you do you can never recover it to make it hght again and so the whole face will be marr ’ and appear unhandsome the shadows are generally fainter and lighter in fair face than in swarthy complexion when your draught is finished you will do well to give fome hard touches with your pen where the shadows are darkest which will add great life and grac to your drawing when your face is finished you come next to the cars and hair wherein you must observe this rule having drawn the out-line of it you must first draw tle princi pal curl or master stroke in the hair which will guide you wich ease to do the lesser curls which depend on them always make your curl to be bent and turn exactly according to the pattern that they may lie loose and fast and not appear stiff stub born and unpliable when you have drawn your curl exactly you must in the last place strike in the loose hairs which hang carelessly out of the curls the face being drawn which is the principal thing in the art chen proceed to the hands and arms legs and feet and so to full bodies of men and women of drawing tbe hands and feet the actions and postures of the hand are so various that no certain rule can be given for drawing of them only this in general when you first draw it with charcoal you are not to do it exactly that is you must not make the joints or veins or other things to appear more than lightly or faintly and to touch out the big ness of the hand and the manner of turning it with faint touches and not with hard strokes if you have done that right then you part the fingers asunder or close according to your pattern with the like faint strokes then mark that place where any of the fingers stand out from the others and make faint resemblance of it having so done if you perceive your draught to be right proceed to draw it more perfectly and make the bending of the joint the wrist-bone and other principal things somewhat exactly and laftly go over it again and draw every small bending or swelling of the fingers and make the nails knuckles and veins so many of them as appear and every thing else that you can discern the proportion of hand you have sufficiently described in the print which shews how many qualities or equal measures there be in it which you should endeavour to be acquainted with that fo you may know when hand is well proportioned with just and equal distances but you are to observe this rule or exception that according as the hand turns one way or other the proportions must be shortened according as they appear in the eye as you may see by the fore-shortning of the hand in the print so much as the hand turns away from our fight so much it lofss of its ordinary propor tion and is made to shorten unto that proportion that the eye judges of it nay some times whole finger sometimes two or three or more are lost to our sight by the turning of the hand another way from us and so they must be wholly left out and not made as to the feet it is not fo difficult to draw them as it is the hands and you must proceed in the same method in the one as in the other when you can draw hands and feet pretty well then proceed to arms and legs wherein is little difficulty after which you may procced to whole bodies rules to be observed in drawing the whole body in the drawing of body you must begin with the head to which you must give just proportion and bigness because all the body must be proportioned accord ing to the head when you have drawn the head proceed to the shoulders and go on to the trunk of the body beginning at the arm-pits leaving the arms till afterwards and so draw down to the hips on both sides and be sure you observe the exact breadth of the waist when you have done thus draw first that leg on which the body stands and afterwards that which stands loose or from the body and last of all the arms and then the hands either joined to the body or separated from it agreeable to your pattern observe in your drawing to place the parallel joints finews and muscles directly opposite in strait even line one against the other as the shoulders arm-pits waist hips knees and so every thing else that one may not be higher or lower than the other that the body may not seem crooked or deformed but every parallel joint bend may directly answer the other that is opposite to it to which end you may strike strait stroke directly cross the shoulders to direct you to place them even and strait one against the other which you may likewise do in other places as the arms waist hips thighs or any other parts that are opposite where you should place the one even with the other but you must have the same care in all parts of the body as you have in one place where any bendings or members of the body have or do require direct opposition onc to the other you make use of this help and direction observe that if the body turn one way or other then this stroke must be so sruck that it may answer the bowing of the body thus if the body stoop little downwards yon must strike the stroke stoping or sideways in which case you must make the shoulders and other things which should be strait against one another to be somewhat higher than one another so that the side which the body turns upon the shoulders and other things that otherwise should be placed even against the other must be made somewhat lower than the other side more or less according to the stooping of the body as you are to be careful in the placing rightly all level or parallel joints bendings finews and muscles so you must be very exact in all perpendicular joints muscles that is when vou have drawn the out-lines of your piece and are come to draw the joints and muscles that are within the body you must be as exact in placing them that is directly once against another as you are in placing chose even that are opposite to one another to the end that you may place things exactly perpendicular that is in strait line one under another you may strike strait perpendicular line from the pit of the throat down to the privities just in the middle or seam of the body where you discern the parting of the ribs and from thence strait down to the fect which line will direct yon to place things perpendicularly even that the body may stand strait upright and not appear crooked or awry take notice of the bowings and bendings that are in the body to make that part which is opposite to that which bends to answer to it in bending with it thus if one side of the body is bent in the other side must stand out answerable to the bend ing in of the other fide if the back bend out the belly must bend in if the belly come in the back must stick out if the breech stick out the thigh that answers to it in opposition must come in so also in any other part of the body as when the knee bends out the hams that answer to it must come in and the same rule must strictly be observed in all other joints of the body otherwise the body will be made grosly and absurdly and without any proportion be careful to make things of an equal proportion and bigness that one arm or leg be not bigger than the other or one breast larger than the other or any part of the body in an unjust proportion but as every thing in face must answer to the big ness of the face so one member must answer to another in bigness that so there may be perfect harmony in all the parts of the body that it may not have brond shoulders and thin slender waist raw-bone arm and thick gouty leg or any part dispro portionable from the other unless it be so that any part of the body do turn awry from our eye thus it one arm should be seen side-ways and the other fore-right then the one arm must be made so much less than the other by how much it turns awat frem our fight and appears less to our eye and if one leg be seen full or fore-right and the other leg be seen side-ways then it must be made so much less than the other by low much it turns away from your fight as just proportion must be observed in the bigness of your draught so like wife in the length that one thing may not be too long for the other the body not too long for the legs nor the legs too short for the body that neither leg nor arm be disproportioned in their lengths but that every thing have its due proportion both for length and bigness unless when the body shortens away in any part from your fight as thus it one leg stand behind the other it must be made so much shorter than the other according to the distance it is removed from your eye se likewise if one arm remove itself ever lo little out of your light that which comes first to the eye and stands nearest to the sight must be made longer than the other and the other be made so much the shorter by how much it turns away from your sight so again is any part of the body be fore-shortened that is if it appears so to your eye as to hinder the full light of the latitude of that part of the body then the body or that part of the body must be made to shorten according to that proportion that the eye judges of it observe the due distance of one thing from another that you may be exact in your draught and perfectly imitate your pattern observe how much one part of the body sticks out beyond the other or falls in within the other or whether it stands even with the other to which end you may strike small stroke down from the top of the shoulder along by the outside of the body strait down to the fect and this will direct you how far one part of the body should sland out beyond the other and how far other parts should come in let no thing be done without rule and judgment let nothing be donc hard sharp or cutty that is let not the bendings that are in the body or in the joints be made as if they were dents or cuts in the flesh with sharp corner strokes but finely round and sloping like bendings and not like cuts in the body this is common fault among learners who should therefore be the more careful to avoid it by imitating their pattern exactly in the manner of making every stroke and touch that is given for nothing should be done without judgment rules for drawing landskips landskip is the expressing tract of land by hills woods castles seas valleys ruins rocks in which there is not so much difliculty as in drawing figurcs and therefore the following rules will be sufficient the best way of making landskips is to represent them shooting away one part lower than another as hath been practised by our best artists but others have run into contrary error by making the landskip mount up higher and higher till it reach to such height that it seems as if it touched the clouds as if the drawer had stood at the bottom of steeple when he took the prospect which is altogether incon gruous for we can discern no prospect at the bottom of hill but the most proper way of making landskip is to make the nearest hill highest and so to make the rest that are at greater distance to shoot away under that that the landskip may appen as if taken from the top of hill be careful to lessen every thing in proportion to its distance expressing it bigger or less according to the distance it is from the eye you must make all your lights fall one way both upon the ground and trees and all things else and all the shadows mult be cast one way you must give every thing its proper motion as trees when they are shaken with the wind their smaller and more pliable boughs must be shewn in such an action as if they struck one against another by yielding and declining from that part whence the wind blows the stiffer boughs have less bending and motion you must likewise observe the bending of twig when bird fits upon it so likewite it it be forced or pressed with any other thing clouds in the air must be shewn with motions now gathered together with the winds now violently condenfed into hail thunder-bolts lightnings rain and such like finally you can make nothing but what requires motion peculiar to itself ac cording to which it ought to be represented but this rule you must always observe namely that all your motions which are caused by the wind must be seen to move one way because the wind can blow but one way at once always express fair horizon shewing the heavens cloudy or clear more or less ac cording to the occasion and if you express the fun let it be either rising or setting and as it were behind or over some hill or mountain the moon and stars are seldom or never depicted unless it be in representation of twilight because all things are supposed to be seen by day if you express the fun make his light to reflect upon all the trees hills moun tains rocks or buildings shading the contrary side after which manner also shadow clouds mists and the like making the shadows to fall all one way in expressing things at large distances as ten twenty or thirty miles off where the object is hard to be discerned as whether it be temple castle house or the like shew no particular signs thereof or any eminent distinction but rather as weakly faintly and confusedly as the eye judgeth of it if landskips be lid in colours the farther you go the more you must lighten it with thin and airy blue to make it seem as if it were afar off beginning first with dark green io driving it by degrees into blue according to the distance in rivers observe the general current and dashing of the waves against the boat sides in the sea observe the waves and other proper agitations the rowling of the biliows the tumbling of vessels up and down ships floating some dipt some half drowned some standing almost on end some hid almost with the waves through the uncertainty of the surges others striving to live in the motion of waters falling from an high place but especially when they fall upon rocks or stones you must make it leaping up in the air and sprinkling all about it your work imitate the season you intend it for thus if you intend it for winter piece represent felling of timber sliding upon the ice fowling by night hunting of bears or foxes in the snow making the trees every whole naked or laden with hoar frost the carth bare without greenness flowers or cattle the air thick water frozen with carts pissing over it and boys upon it lastly let every site have its proper works adjuncts or additional graces as the farm-house windmill woods flocks of sheep herds of cattle pilgrims ruins of temples castles monuments with thousand such other things only proper to par ticular subjects to take the perfect draught of any picture take sheet of fine venice paper wet it all over with linseed oil on one side thereof which then wipe off as clean as you can let the paper dry and lay it to any painted or printed picture then with black lead pencil you may draw it over with ease put this oiled paper upon sheet of clean white paper and with little pointed stick on feather our of swallow ’ wing draw over the stroke which yon draw upon the oiled piper so shall you have the exact form upon the white paper which may be fet out with colours with pleasure to make the shape of leaf herb or plant hold whole ieaf or sprig as of nettles plantane in the smoak of gum sandrack rosin link or wax candle 'till it is well black which place between the leaves of sheet of white paper and carefully press upon the leaf with some smooth thing so shall you have in moment the print on the paper espe cially the backside thereof with the very ramifications of the fibres disperied through it this may be of good use in travelling when we meet with strange plants of colours for landskips light green use pink and masticot heightened with white for sad green indico and pink heightened with masticot for some trees take lake umber and white for others charcoal and white for others black and white with some green adding some lake or vermilion with other colours for wood take lake umber and white mixing sometimes little green withal for fire lay red lead and vermillion tempered together where it is reddest where it is blue lay oil smalt and white lead where it is yellow take masticot and work it over in certain places where you would have it shine most with vermilion for an azure sky which seems afar off take oil smalt or bice and temper them wich linseed oil but grind them hot for smalt or bice utterly lose their colour in grinding for red fky take lake and white and for sun-beams or yellow clouds at sun- risng or setting take masticot and white for night sky or clouds in storm take indico deepened with black and heightened with white for wood colours they are compounded either of umber and white charcoal and white seacoal and white umber black and white or with some green addad to which you may adjoin sometimes as in the barks of trees little lake or vermilion of washing and other materials thereof by washing here we intend nothing more but either to set out maps or printed pictures in proper colours or else to varnish them the instruments and materials of washing are six alum-water size or gum water liquid gold pencils colours varnish to make alum-water take alum eight ounces fair water quart boil them till the alum is dsslolved or thus take spring or well-water gallon rock alum pound beat it to powder and dissolve it in water by boiling filter it through brown paper and keep it for use wich this water wet your paper before you lay on your colours it will keep them from sinking in and withal add lustre and beauty to the colours laid on but this you must note that is your paper is not good you must wash it over four or flve times which may be done with large pencil brush moreover alum generally raiseth staining colours and preserves them from fading to make size take glew which steep all night in water then melt it over the fire to see that it be neither too strong nor too weak then let little of it cool if it be too stiff when it is cold put more water to it if too weak more glew using it lake warm to make gum-water take pure spring water quart put it into jar glass and hang therein sufficient quantity of pure white and clean gum arabick bruised and tied up in rag let it hang till the gum is dissolved then put your fingers into the water and if you find them ftick together as it they were glewed your water is too stiff or full of the gum which you must remedy by putting thereto more fair water and if you find it too weak you may help it by adding more gum with this water or the former fize most colours are to be tempered and wich so much of the gum-water as being touched when dry the colour will not come off where note that if the colour glisten there is too much gum in it liquid gold and silver take five or six leaves of gold and silver which glind with stiff gum-lake water and good quantity of salt as small as you can then put it into vial or glazed vessel add so much fair water as may dissolve the gum-water then let it sland four hours that the gold may settle decant the water and put in more till che gold is clean washed to the gold put more fair water little sal-ar moniac and common salt digesting it close for four days then put all into piece of thin glovers leather whose grain is peleed off and hang it up so will the sal ar moniac fret away and the gold remain behind which keep when you use it temper it wich glair of eggs and so use it with pen or pencil glair of rggs is thus made take the whites and beat them with spoon till they rise all in foam then let them stand all night and by morning they will be turned into clear water which is good glair of colours simple for washing of maps brazil to some ground brazil put small beer and vinegar of each suffici ent quantity let it boil gently good while then put therein alum in powder to heighten the colour and some gum arabick to bind it boil it till it taste strong or the tongue and make good red pink colour or light violet logwood ground logwood boiled as brazil makes very fair transparent violet or purple colour cochineal steeped as brazil was boiled makes fair transparent purple as thus tike cochineal and put it into the strongest soap-lees to steep and it will be fair purple which you may lighten and deepen at pleasure infused in strong vinegar it makes transparent purple madder take madder four drams ground brazil one ounce rain-water quart boil away third part then add alum half an ounce boil it to pint ihen gum arabick onc ounce which boil till it is dissolved cool it stirring it often and strain it for use it is good scarlet die for leather verdigrise take verdigrise ground finely one ounce put to it good quantity of common varnish and so much oil of turpentine as will make it thin enough to work withal it is good green fine verdigrise dissolved in rhenish wine or vinegar makes transparent green inclining to blue ground with juice of rue and gum-water it is pure green without the juice it makes glorious emerald mixed with crystal of tartar in white wine vinegar in which gum arabick has been dissolved makes pure green and verdigrise alum of each one dram logwood three drams boiled in vinegar make good murry cambogia dissolve it in fair spring-water and it will make beautiful and transparent yellow or if you would have is stronger dissolve some alum there in it is good for silk linen white-leather parchment valleum paper quills this colour delights in no mixture turnsole put into sharp vinegar over gentle fire till the vinegar boil and is co loured then take out the turnsole and squeeze it into the vinegar in which dissolve little gum arabick it shadows very well on carnation or yellow flory blue grind it with glair of eggs if you then add little rossel it makes light violet blue mixed with white and red-lead it makes crane-feather colour indian lake ground with gum-arabick water makes glorious murry in grinding it add little sugar candy some say it makes deep pink of bloom colour vermillion being ground with glair of eggs and honey or gum-water it makes deep red or scarlet colour red-lead grind it with stiff gum-lake water if you add saffron it makes an orient and marrigold colour of itself it is between red and an orange colour orpiment washed and coloured with gum-water makes an orient or gold colour there are several degrees of it some more red others more yellow indico ground and tempered with gum-water makes deep blue and is fit to shadow all other blues sap-green steep it in sharp vinegar all night to which add little alom to raise its colour in alom-water it makes good green to shadow with ivory black burnt ground and tempered wich gum-water makes good black flake lead ground and tempered with gum-water is an excellent white spanish white ground and tempered in like manner with gum-water makes the best of all whites spanish brown burnt ground and tempered with gum-water makes à reddish brown or liver-colour umber burnt and ground and tempered with gum-water makes good haw colour and is very good to shadow with upon gold green of walnuts boiled in water and strained and gum-arabick dissolved in the liquor to bind it makes an excellent colour to express highways lanes of compound colours for washing of maps orange colours red-lead and yellow-berries make good orange colour thus take annatto hall an ounce pot-ashes one drachm water one pound boil it half away then strain it and use it hot lt is gooll for white leather paper vellum quills parchment green take distilled vineger silings of copper digest till the vinegar is blue which let stand in the sun or on flow fire till it is thick enough and it will be good green or thus take cedar green which is best of all or instead therecof green bice steep it in vinegar and strain it then grind it well wich fair water and put to it little honey and dry it well when you use it mix it with gum-water to make fine indico take of the blossoms of oad three ounces amylum one ounce grind them with urine and strong vinegar of which make cake then dry it in the sun and so keep it for use blue to wash upon paper take of the beft azure an ounce kermes two ounces mix them which temper with clear gum-water and it will be glorious colour to make venice blue take quick lime make it into paste wich strong vinegar halt an hour after put thereto more vinegar to soften it then add indico in fine pow der one ounce mix them and digest it in horse-dung for or days another excellent biue mix fine white chalk with juice of elder-berries full ripe to which put little alom-water to make blue smalt take fluxible sand fal-nitre and cobalt mix them togeth lively yellow dissolve orpiment in gum-water to which put little ground vermillion grind them together and you shall have very lively colour light green take juice

spanish brown to colour any horse dog or the like you must not calcine it yet not calcined it is dirty colour but to shadow vermillion or lay upon any dark introduction ground behind picture to shade berries in the darkelst places or to colour wooden posts wainscot bodies of trees and the like it is very good being burnt flesh colour mix white indian lake and red-lead according as you would hive it light or deep and to dislinguish man ’ flesh from woman ’ mingle it with littie oker colour of stoner verdigrise with varnish makes an emerald with florence lake ruby with ultramarine sapphire never-fading green take juice of flowers of flower-de-luce put into gum-water and dry it in the sun of mixing colours and shadowing in mixing be careful not to make the colour too fad nor take the pencils out of one colour and put them into another in mixing colours stir them well about the water severally till they are well mixed then put them together making the colour fadder or lighter at pleasure green is shadowed with indico and yellow-berries blue is shadowed with indico litmose and flory or any of them being steeped in soapralhes and used with gum-water garments are shadowed with their own proper colours or you may mingle the co¬ lours witn white for the light and shadow it wich the same colour unmingled or you may take the thinnest of the colour for the light and shadow with the thickesl or bot tom of the same sapgreen is only uied to shadow other greens with and not to be laid for ground in any garment late ought not to be shadowed with any colour for it is dark red but for variety you may shadow it with bice or bluc verditure which will make it like changeable taffeta the shadow for yellow-berries is umber but for beauty fake with red-lead and the darkest touches wich spanish brown and for variety with copper-green blue bice or verditure white sets off blues and blacks very well red sets off well with yellow yellows with reds fad blues browns greens and purples blues set off well wich yellows reds whites browns and blacks and green set off well with purples and reds compound green mix verdigrise water with yellow-berry water it will be trans parent and you may make it deeper or lighter according to the proportion that you take of either compound blue colour mix litmose water with yellow-berry water and yon will have tranfsarent fsd blue which you may heighten or deepen as the former at pleasure compound orange colour it is made by mixing braül water with yellow-berry water of transparent colour of colours for washing landskips green mixed with white pink bice maslicot smalt indico or ceruse or blue verditure mixed with few yellow-berries makes good green for landskips for the saddest hills use umber burnt for the lightest place put yellow to the burnt umber for other hills lay copper-green thickened on the fire or in the fun for the next hills farther off mix yellow-berries with copper-green let the fourth part be done with green verditure and the farthest and saintest places with blue bice or blue verditure mingled with white and shadowed with blue verditure in the shadows in different thick let the highways be done with white and red lead and for variety yellow oker shadow it with burnt umber which you may use for fandy rocks and hills rocks may be done with several colours in some places black and white in other places red and white and others blue and white and the like as you see convenient the water must be black verditure and white shadowed wich green and bluc ver diture when the banks cast green shadow upon the water and the water is black shadowed then shade it with indico green thickened and blue verditure colour buildings with as much variety of pleasant colours as may be imaginable yet let reason be your rule in mixing your colours you may sometimes use white and black for the wall conduits or other things for brick houses and the like red lead and white if many houses stand together set them off with variety of colours as umber and white lake and white red-lend and white and the like lastly for the sky use maslicot or yellow-berries and white for the lightest and west places red rosset and white for the next degree blue bice and white for the other blue bice or blue for the highest these degrees and colours must be fs wrought together that tle edge of each colour may not receive any sharpness that is so as that you can not perceive where you be gan to lay them being so drowned one in another of the practice of washing with the alom-water wet over the picture to be coloured for that keeps the co lours from sinking into the paper and will add lustre unto them make them shew fairer and keep them from fading then let the paper dry of itself being walled with alom-water before you lay on the colour or before you wet it again for some paper will need wetting four or five times the washing of the paper must be donc with large pencil brush but if you intend to varnish your pictures after you have coloured them instead of washing them with alom-water first size them with new fize made of good white starch with very fine brush and this you must be sure to do all over for else the varnish will sink through having thus prepared your work go to laying on your colours according to your former directions suiting them as near as may be to the life of every thing how to lay on your colour first provide yourself of pencils of several sizes and if you will be curious you ought to have great and small to each respective colour if not you must always have by you dish of fair water in which you must wash and cleanse your pencil wiping it with clean linen cloth before yon put it into another colour for your pencils close those that are good thus see that they be fullest next the quill descending or lessening into small room or sharp point which you may see by putting the hair into your mouth and drawing it through your lips once or twice then you see what it is and if you find any straggling hairs finge them off with the flame of candle being thus provided with colours and pencils if you delsgn to lay any colour about the edges of any map part piece or division of ground in plat as suppose you would inclose particular field or close in meadow with yellow with your pencil take camboge or yellow-berry water very small quantity and on the inside of the black lead line draw the colour along of an equal breadth as near as you can from the line broader or narrower as your field is in bigness not daubing the field or close all over with the colour which would be but an abuse to your map or plat then having gone round the close or field in this manner with your colour wet your pencil in your mouth or have by you small quantity of water to dip it in and strike along the inside of the coloured line bringing it more down towards the center of the field and this will sweeten your colour and make it shew as if it loft itfelf by degrees to the very colour of your paper or parchment this course is to be taken not only for yellows but for all other colours lastly with pen if you can not do it handsomely with pencil take fome of the colour which shadows the colour you have already used about the field and go over your black-lead only fo shall your field be finished lastly after the same manner you may adorn all the parts in your plat or map of divers colours
