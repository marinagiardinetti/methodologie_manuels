th school of raphael or the student' guide to expression in historical painting illustrated by examples engraved by duchange and others under the inspection of sir as dorign from his own drawings after the most celebrated heads in the cartons at the queen ’ palace to which are now added the outlines of each head and also several plates of the antique statues skeletons and anatomical figures most celebrated engraved by an eminent rti st. with instructions for young students in the art of designing the pa ssions as characterised by raphael in the cartons described and explained by benjamin ralph london printed for john boydell engraver in cheapside mdcclxxxii introduction it is usual for thé compilers of drawing-books not only to complain of thé ignorancé and in- accuracy of all that have preceded them but to raise new expectation without any sense of the danger of new disappointment the author of the following sheets however intends not by depreciating the labours of others to procure that credit for his own which the same arts of supplantation may as effectually destroy from fincere love for the art itself from desire of communicating the means of improvement to others and from well-established hope that the science of painting for in historical compositions it is surely more than an art is reviving in all its splendour in this island he has been induced to recommend the incomparabie examples in this book and he is persuaded they will contiibute to the proficiency of every one whose happy genius urges him to excel in study that not only leads to the knowledge of true beauty but directs the application of it to innumerable purposes of entertainment and use it was indeed at first determined to give only the outlines and finished heads with an explana- tion of the characters from consideration that such collection was peculiarly adapted to the use of painters or at least of those who had already attained to competent degree of excellence in the art but as no bounds can be set to the genius of youth so no limits ought to be put to the means of improvement and in order to render this work useful to the learner as well as the proficient it was afterwards thought necessary to prefix some examples even of the rudiments of design as well as of those of the most elegant of the human form and to give with them the best instructions that could be collected and as it is undoubtedly true that the grecian and italian schools are the only treasuries of design from which could examples be taken with so much propriety as from the grecian ’ statues and the works of raphael accordingly all the examples have been taken from them except the geometrical figures and the bones and muscles of the human body which are selected from the works of those authors that are esteemed most correct to whom however no recourse would have been had if the subjects could have been supplied from the same source though no examples of perspective are given yet it must not be inferred that this omission of so useful part of science is occasioned either by ignorance of the art itself or inattention to the just improvement of this work to the design of which the examples of perspective are wholly foreign it is indeed complete study of itself and as such the practice of that incomparable method laid down by dr. brooke taylor and with great pains and ingenuity explained by mr. kirby is earnestly recommended the principal design of this work is to encourage the study of the most profound part of painting the characteristies of the passions in order to which the sacred histories represented in the inimitable cartons of raphael have been considered separately and the principal charac- ters in each described and referred to in the several heads in the work and an index is given for finding the paffions under their proper denominations referring to the description of each and also to the design of the character itself- le brun the only author who has written on the passions as painter and given rules for describing them has certainly succeeded very well so far as he goes but his examples instead of answering all the purposes of study appear upon comparing them with those in the cartons to be extremely defective nay it may be affirmed that person who has only studied le brun will be at loss when he views some of the characters in the cartons to know what paffions are ex- pressed in them and yet the ideas will be found to be in the highest degree exalted just and significant and he will be struck with astonishment and disgust when he returns to his former study in which he will find no traces to lead his ideas back to the point from which they first set out the cartons are indeed vast fund of variety from which every man may enrich himself without diminishing the heap or depriving those who come after him of their share of the inex- haustible treafure bequeathed to the whole world by that incomparable painter if therefofe the explanation of the cartons should be found defective let it be remembered that the attempt is new that the characters described are those of the holy jesus and his immediate followers who were the greatest and best of mankind and that the cartons are the labours of the first genius in painting that has appeared in the world since those of ancient greece of whose stupendous performances we have nothing left but the names this author however he may be censured or ridiculed for such an asfertion can not help saying that collection of the passions as they are found in nature might be made from the works of mr. hogarth which would do honour to that master and prove of great utility to young students of the study of geometrical figure though this part of the work will undoubtedly be censured by those who are contented with superficial knowledge of thé art of designing yet the end proposed will be suffici- ciently answered if it meets with the approbation of the few let those who deride admo- nition and chuse to wanton upon the surface of the stream float gently down it and divert them- selves with the sticks and weeds with which they will be insensibly and inevitably entangled. '' errors like straws upon the surface flow '' those who would search for pearls must dive below '' however it is not expected nor is it indeed necessary that perfect designer should be perfect geometrician but it is certainly expected that he should be acquainted with the form and con- struction of the most simple geometrical figures which are in fact the basis of the art he would study to those therefore who would attain to masterly manner of designing it is recommended to study carefully the figures described in plate to make them familiar and to endeavour to imitate their forms rather by the hand guided by judgment than the rule and compass for as fresnox judiciously observes the compass should ratber be in the painters eyes than bis hands but as the true construction of these figures is easily attained it will probably argue either self-suf- ficiency or indolence not to be acquainted with it explanation of the geometrical figures in the first plate figure to bisect

with certainty how to draw that curved line which the author of the analysis of beauty has with as great propriety as authority termed the line of beauty and upon the use and properties of which he has obliged the world with very elegant ingenious and instructive treatise it has however been objected that he has omitted to give rule whereby the precise line of beatety may be found in consequence of which objection and in order to enforce the study of that line this figure is given not as mathematical demonstration nor as an insult upon the author of the analysis of beauty whose meaning is very obvious though perhaps not so fully explained as to silence the clamours of ignorance and detraction but as à line extremely well worth studying being in itself simple elegant easily drawn and the precise line of beauty described by that great artist whose plain unaffected manner of referring to the most familiar objects for the explanation of his ideas we shall endeavour to follow and inform the reader that it is to be found in an ornament well known to every school-boy that of six-pointed star of which the contrasted halves of any two opposite points give the line required the explanation of the geometrical figures in the first plate the construction of the ninth figure divide circle into four equal parts by the rule before given the semi-diameter or the distance from to

from the point draw cd figure this figure is founded upon precept said to be given by the celebrated michael angelo to his scholar marcus de scienna which according to lomazzo was ee that he should always make figure et pyramidal serpent-like and multiplied by one two and threek which precept as the auchor of the analysis observes hath remained mystery down to this time and indeed it appears not only to be mysterious but absurd to talk of multiplying by the number one is grofs impropriety and that michael angelo should advise his scholar always to make figure pyramidal and serpentine and multiplied by those numbers must be mistake for every figure in picture can not possibly admit of such rule for instance it is not to be preserved in figure sitting or stooping and consequently michael angelo who well knew the necessity of such attitudes would never impose such stricture the truth is this famous precept had suffered the fate of many other excellent tradi- tional rules before it came to lemazzs who transcribed it as it was delivered to him contenting himself with the authority of the master and the ambiguity of the precept itself it is perhaps more rational to believe that michael angelo endeavoured to persuade his pupil to accustom himself to draw figure or line which was pyramidal serpentine and increasing in the proportion of one two and zbree as fure means of acquiring habit of designing the outlines of tec human body in masterly manner and thereby as the author of the analysis terms it always expressing the lines of beauty and grace louazzo proceeds to explain the foregoing precept thus in which precept in mine opinion the whole mysterie of the arte consisteth for the greatest grace and lise that pic- ture can have is that it expresse motion which the painters call the spirite of picture nowe there is no forme so fitte to expresse this motion as that of the flame of fire which according to aristotle and the other philosophers is an elemente most active of all others because the forme of the flame thereof is most apt for motion for it hath conus or sharpe pointe wherewith it seemeth to divide the aire that so it may ascende to his proper sphere so that picture having this forme will be most beautiful now this is to be understood after two fortes either that the conus of the byramis be placed upwardes and the base downwardes as in the fier or else contrary wise with the base up- wardes and the conus downwardes in the first it expresseth the width and largenesse of picture about the legges and garmentes below shewing it slender above pyramidall wise by discovering one shoulder and hiding the other which is shortned by the turning of the body in the seconde it sheweth the figure biggest in the upper partes by representing either both the shoulders or both the armes shewing one legge and hiding the other or both of them after one sorte as the skilful painter shall judge fittest for his purpose so that his michael angelo ’ meaning is that it should resemble the forme of the letter placed right or else turned the wronge way as because then it hath this beauty neither ought he only to observe this forme in the whole body but even in every part so that in the legge when muscle is raysed outwardes on the one side that which answereth directly on the contrary side must be drawn in and hid as may be seene in the life the last parte of michael angelo his observation was that picture ought to be multiplied by one two and three and herein consisteth the chiefest szill of that proportion whereof mean to intreate more at large in this booke for the diameter of the biggest place betweene the knee and the fcote is double to the least and the largest part of the thigh triple in the observations on the art of painting of du fresnoy it is said that the outlines which are in waves give not only grace to the parts but also to the whole body as we see in the an- see haydocke ’ translation printed at oxford see dryden ’ translation of du fresnoy ’ art of painting tinous explanation of the geometrical figures in the first plate tinous the venus of medicis and others and further it is said besides that the figures and their parts ought almost always to have serpentine and flaming form naturally these sorts of out- lines have know not what of life and seeming motion in them which very much resembles the ac- tivity of the flame and of the serpent elsum in his art of painting after he has quoted the above precept of michael angelo has this remarkable passage but for as much as there are two sorts of pyramids the one straight as is that near st. peter ’ in rome called the pyramid of julius caesar the other waived like flame and is called michael angelo serpentine this latter also painter must imitate his contours must turn and wind like serpent it is presumed that the tenth figure has all the properties mentioned by the foregoing authors it actually expresses motion as that of flame of streamer agitated by the wind is true represent- ation of the decreasing swell of wave and is consequently proper study for those who are emulous of excelling in designing the outlines of the human body and though it may not carry with it suf- ficient proof of its being the very precept of michael angelo it is hoped the time which is bestowed on its consideration will not be thrown away the construction of the tenth figure upon the line draw circle cat pleasure take the diameter of that circle and from the cir- cuiference of the circle upon the line ab draw thie circle which will be twice the diameter of then take the distance from the centers cand and from the circumserence of the circle draw the circle which will be three times the diameter of the lesser circle and proceed to draw the curves in the same manner as described in fig figure xi shews the manner of dividing line into any number of equal parts this figure will be found to be of great use in forming squares for drawings from pictures whether they are to be enlarged or reduced and is constructed in the following manner draw ab the line proposed and from draw the line at plcasure then setting the com- passes in cut the lines ab and ad in ef and keeping the same distance in the compasses from cut the line ab at then take the distance ef and setting it off from to draw the line bi upon which the line in the example

ad and the line will be divided into eight equal parts see elsum ’ art of painting after the italian manner printed at london the art of designing or drawing the theory of design is the knowledge which is acquired by reading the best authors who have laid down rules for the attainment of the art scientifically and given their judgment upon the performances of the greatest painters by thorough knowledge of the theory of design those who are themselves unable to draw the most simple objects may be qualified to pass sentence upon the works of the best masters and in this case theory being separated from practice is usually con- sidered in another light and distinguished by the appellation of taste there is also another way of acquiring taste without reading and that is by frequently examining good pictures in the presence of such as are esteemed judges of the art who seldom fail of giving their opinion without reserve and thus according to the portion of knowledge they possess and the understanding of those who are attentive to their decisions theory or taste may be obtained in greater or lesser degree theozy therefore in this sense of the word has hitherto been the great support of painting had tafte been confined to practical study only so many noble and invaluable pieces would not now have been found in the palaces of princes and the houses of great men whose avocations could not per- haps otherwise permit them to acquire any taste at all for this art and consequently painting would have found no patronage the practical part of design is the constant application of the hand assisted by the understanding in the imitation of variety of forms those objects whether persons or places of which we have but transient view are in the memory like sketches made with charcoal upon paper which either the slightest rubbing or blast of wind will entirely deface how then shall the hand unaecustomed to exercise in this art perform its function when the mind itself after the object has been removed from before it short time can retain only confused idea of its resemblance theory and practice therefore ought to be in- separable and the knowledge of either without its affociate can never produce any thing like per- fection from what has been already said it is obvious that drawing considered only as such is nothing more than an habit by which the hand being accustomed to follow the traces of the eye conveys upon paper or other materials the similitude of objects and can only be obtained by unwearied ap- plication and great attention by practice the hand acquires facility which gives freedom and this frecdom must constantly be corrected by judgment in placing every particular part in the object to be delineated in its proper order it must be observed that judgment is not here meant to be that exertion of the understand- ing which would be requisite to compose an historical picture or well-imagined landschape but re- lates only to proportion or an accurate consideration of the distance of one feature limb or part from another it being no unusual thing for such as draw very well practically to be utterly inca- pable of composing or inventing which ought to be with more propriety ascribed to genius the manual part of designing consists in two operations outline and relief the first of these with regard to buman figures comprehends anatomy and proportion the second light and shadow and these are produced by batching with chalks pen and ink and black lead or washing with indian ink bistre proportion and relief are also absolutely necessary in other parts of design as landschape orna- ments the necessary materials for designing are charcoal red black and white chalk indian ink bistre black lead pencils crow quill pens and camels hair pencils the the charcoal should be chosen with fine grain such as will mark freely and may be discharged easily by brushing it either with feather or silk handkerchief it is of great use in sketching or mark- ing out the general idea of the figure or part to be designed and the strokes being easily effaced the drawing may by degrees be brought to its due proportion and be afterwards more ccrrectly finished with either of the chalks it has been already said of what importance the geometrical figures in plate are to the art ofde- signing let thiem therefore be carefully studied and frequently drawn even while the student thinks himself qualified to proceed further for as confinement to dry studies often creates disgust it is rather recommended to the learner to blend the practice of them with the most easy examples in the other plates let not the student be deterred from proceeding by the appearance of difficulties what is thought unsurmountable may be conquered by repeated trials and the wonder will be that it should ever have appeared in so discouraging light it will be sound extremely advantageous to hold the port crayon or other instrument something more than two inches from the bottom for freedom is the very essence of design begin rather with parts than whole figure an attempt to draw the figure of man by one who is unable to mark the outline of head will be unsuccessful and such an effort instead of applause will certainly meet with contempt proceed therefore with designing the different features of the face and each of them in different positions and when these can be performed with accuracy it will be proper to begin with whole head the examples of the oval for drawing the face and head in plate should now be carefully con- sidered and fig xiv in that plate is an example of an head according to the most exact propor- tion the oval is divided by perpendiculaf line from top to bottom and that line into four equal parts the upper division describes the space from the top of the head to the lowest hair upon the forehead the next division passes between the eyebrows and eyelids and not through the eyes as has been erroneoussy taught from thence to the bottom of the third division is the length of the nose and the fourth contains the mouth and chin this last is again divided into three equal parts the first of which shews the space from the bottom of the nose to the middle of the mouth the second contains the under lip and the space between that and the chin and the chin fills the third part of the lower division of the face the length of the eye is reckoned one fifth part of the breadth of the face which is also the breadth of the nose from the extremity of each nostril and the mouth is nearly of the same measure the ear is of the same length with the nose observe therefore to place every feature properly let the nose be set directly under the center of the forehead and the middle of the mouth exactly under that of the nose place the eyes upon line that there may appear no distortion and be careful that the eyes and mouth are parallel to each other of three quarter faces and profiles there are many fine examples in this book and therefore little more need be said of them it has been sometimes recommended to provide piece of box turned in the shape of an egg to mark off the several divisions upon it and by turning it various ways to observe the different appearance of the lines but it would be much better to try the same experi- ment with small plaster head which may be more easily procured and will certainly answer the purpose much better the student having frequently and carefully designed the head and its parts may now turn his attention to the other extremities of the human body which are the hands and feet these have ever been esteemed difficult part of design and various authors considering them as almost al ways ap- pearing foreshortened have given their proportions and laid down rules for drawing them under those appearances but these it is apprehended are so many fetters to the understanding and stumbling blocks in the way of genius cautious judgment should be our conductor the eye hardly ever sees them in any other situation and it is by the eye the hand should be guided the hand must mark nothing but what the eye directs and the eye can discern no part but what the docile hand may delineate in its proper place in short strict attention to nature or good imitations of her will always lead to truth and elegance and if the design of any subject whatever happens not to be per- fect when finished our observations must have been erroneous and nothing remains but by repeated efforts to amend those parts which the judgment will discover to be incorrect the foregoing study will naturally lead to the arms trunk and thighs of all which several ele- gant examples may be found in plates iii iv and in plate are two views of the celebrated torso of michael angelo of which no greater recommendation can be given than that it was the chief study of the great painter and sculptor whose name it bears it will next be proper to attempt designing whole figure and as this depends in great mea- sure upon proportion as the foundation of symmetry it may not be impertinent to give the meafures of the human body according to the rules laid down by mons du piles in his observations on fres- noy ’ art of paiuting the measures of human body the ancients have commonly allowed eight heads to their figures though some of them have but seven but we ordinarily divide the figures into ten faces .that is to say from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot in the following manner from the crown of the head to the forehead is the third part of the face the face begins at the root of the lowest hairs which are upon the forehiead and ends at the bottom of the chin the face is divided into three proportionable parts the first contains the forchead the second the nose and the third the mouth and chin from the chin to the pit betwixt the collar bones are two lengths of nose from the pit betwixt the coilar bones to the bottom of the breast one face from the bottom of the breasts to the navel one face from the navel to the genitories one face from the genitories to the upper part of the knee two faces the knee contains half face from the lower part of the knee to the ancle two faces from the ancle to the sole of the foot half face man when his arms are stretched out is from the longest finger of his right hand to the longest of his left as broad as he is long from one side of the breasts to the others two faces the bone of the arm called bumerus is the length of two faces from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the little finger the bone called cubitus with part of the hand contains two faces from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the collar bones onè face if you would be satisfied in the measures of breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you must observe that the boxes of the elbows with the bumerus and of the bumerus with the shoulder-blade bear the pro- portion of half face when the arms are stretched out the sole of the foot is the sixth part of the figure the hand is the length of face the thumb contains nose the inside of the arm from the place where the muscle disappears which makes the breast called the pectoral muscle to the middle of the arm four noses from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand five nofes the longest toe is nose long the two outmost parts of the teats and the pit betwixt the collar-bones of woman make an equilateral triangle for the breadth of the limbs no precise measure can be given because the measures them- selves are changeable according to the quality of the persons and according to the movement of the muscles the foregoing rules strongly impressed upon the memory will prove of infinite advantage as well in comparing the proportions of the antique statues with one another as in judging of the different productions of nature in the formation of the human body when considered in design- ing from the life but as variety in composition is absolutely necessary care must be taken that too strict an observance of the above measures may not destroy it nor will the subject always this depends on the age and quality of the persons the apollo and venus of medicis have more than ten faces see the figures the apollo bas nose more see flate fig xiv plate xand xi the apollo has half nose more and the upper balf of the venus de medicis is to the lewer part of the belly and not to the privy parts allow that the figures should preserve the same proportion which the ingenious author of the analysis of beauty has in his chapter of proportion very judiciously remarked in his observations upon the celebrated statue of the apollo-belvederex in the following words may be can not throw stronger light on what has been hitherto said of proportion than by animadverting on remarkable beauty in the apollo-belvedere which hath given it the pre- ference even to the antinous mean super-addition of greatness to at least as much beauty and grace as is found in the latter these two master-pieces of art are seen together in the same apartment at rome where the antinous fills the spectator with admiration only whilst the apollo strikes him with surprise and as travellers exprefs themselves with an appearance of something more than human which they of course are always at loss to describe and this effect they say is the more astonishing as upon examination its disproportion is evident even to common eye one of the best sculptors we have in england who lately went to see them confirmed to me what has been now said particularly as to the legs and thighs being too long and too large for the upper parts and andrea sacchi one of the italian painters seems to have been of the same opinion or he would hardly have given his apollo crowning pasqualini the musician the exact proportion of the antinous in famous picture of his now in england as otherwise it seems to be direct copy from the apollo although in very great works we often see an inferior part neglected yet here it can not be the case because in fine statue just proportion is one of its essential beauties therefore it stands to reason that these limbs must have been lengthened on purpose otherwise it might have easily been avoided so that if we examine the beauties of this figure thoroughly we may reasonably conclude that what has been hitherto thought so unaccountably excellent in its general appearance hath been owing to what hath seemed blemiss in part of it but let us endeavour to make this matter as clcar as possible as it may add more force to what has been said statues by being bigger than life sas this is one and larger than the antinous always gain some nobleness in effect according to the principle of quantity but this alone is not sufficient to give what is properly to be called greatness in proportion here the author refers to two figures of dwarfs or lilliputians in the prints given with his book and proceeds with saying that were they to be drawn or carved by scale of ten feet high they would still be but pigmy proportions as on the other hand figure of but two inches may represent gigantic height therefore greatness of proportion must be considered as depending on the application of quantity to those parts of the body where it can give more scope to its grâce in movement as to the neck for the larger and swan-like turns of the head and to the legs and thighs for the more ample sway of all the upper parts together objects are greater or less by comparison there is no other way of conveying the idea of giant than by comparison he must be accom- panied by one or more figures of the same proportion but they must be drawn upon lesser scale but if to an extraordinary stature it should be requisite to add superior strength it must be done as the before-mentioned author ingeniously observes by judicious exaggeration of particular parts of the body the farnesian hercûles is fine example of uncommon bodily strength see plate vii it is entirely owing to the neglect of comparing objects that particular views of mountains rocks and lakes of water are almost generally deficient the trees buildings vessels and figures which are necessarily introduced with the principal object are usually drawn in much greater proportions than they ought to be and this error never fails to destroy the effect de- sired that which was intended to represent stupendous mountain conveys the idea of paltry hill huge rocks appear like inconsiderable heaps of stone and vast lakes of water are diminished to the size of ordinary fish-ponds the knowledge of anatoux is the basis of design the truth of this affertion is clearly proved by mons du piles who in his principles of paint- ing says as it is in vain to desire to profit by bare sight of fine things if we do not well conceive them so it is impossible thoroughly to understand the beauty of the antique any more than truth in nature without the help of anatomy we may indeed by secing and designing the antique acquire certain greatness of design and in the main get practice tending to good taste and delicacy but these advantages if void of knowledge and principles can only dazzle the spectator by specious shew and by ill-placed remembrances of things man may be in raptures on seeing the fine works of antiquity and yet be far from knowing the genuine source of those beauties which he admires at least if he be ignorant of that fundamental part of design anatomy if then anatomy be the basis of design and enables us to discover the beauties of the antique can not but observe that the knowledge of so much of it as the painter and sculp- tor require is easily retained and that the neglect of this attainment proceeds only from its being thought to lead towards driness of design and pedantry of manner anatouy is knowledge of the parts of the-human body but to painters that only which relates to the bones and the principal muscles which cover them is needful nature has furnished us with bones for the solidity of the body and strength of the mem- bers to them she has fixed the muscles as exterior agents to draw them whither she pleases the bones determine the measures of length and the muscles those of bigness in the parts of nature at least it is the office of the muscles to settle the form and exactness of outlines tis indispensably necessary to be well acquainted with the forms and joints of the bones because motion often alters their measures and likewise to understand the situation and office of the mus- cles since the most striking truth in design depends upon them the bones themselves are motionless and stir only by the help of the muscles the muscles have their origins and insertions by their origins they are fastened to bone which they were never intended to stir and by their insertions to another bone which they draw when they please towards their origins every muscle has its opposite muscie when one acts the other yields like well-buckets one of which descends as the other comes up the acting muscle swells and contracts next to its origin the other that obeys dilates and relaxes the largest bones which are moved with the greatest difficulty are covcred with the largest tmuscles these are often aided by others which are designed for the samc office and thereby increase the force of motion and make the part more apparent we often observe in the naked parts of antique figures and even in nature itself certain swells the reason of which we can not discover without considering the situation and office of the muscle which is the cause of them eut those who are skilful in anatomy see all in seeing part and know how to remove from the eye what the skin and fat seem to conceal and what is hid to those who are ignorant of this science as the knowledge of anatomy is absolutely necessary for the attainment of perfection in design very particular attention to the examples of the bones and muscles in plates vi vii viil and ix is recommended when the student has acquired tolerable habit of designing and also made himself equally conversant with the bones and muscles it will be found of the utmost advantage in drawing the human body to sketch out in the first place the ofteology or skeleton of the figure in its pro- per proportion and in the attitude required which may be done either from print painting or nature itself the next operation will be to delineate the proper muscles marking each dis- tinctly in its place in bold manner after which the figure will probably appear over-charged with muscles and now it will be of the utmost importance to recollect the idea of the waving line which is described in plate fig for it will be only by thorough comprehension of the use of that line that the drawing will appear to be well or ill executed when sinished the skilful in anatomy know that where the insertions of the muscles appear too hard and over- charged and the hollows too deep which is always the case in prepared muscular figure that nature has wisely contrived to remedy the defect and fill up those vacancies by placing therein certain quantities of fat which softens the harshneis and inequality of the lines and produces that inexpressible grace which is always found in the outlines of well-proportioned bodies and which has been so happily imitated by the ancients as naked figures can not be introduced with any propriety except in some particular subjects where there is an absolute necessity for them it becomes matter of the greatest importance to cloath them gracefully it will now therefore be proper to give some rules por designing oe draperies the gradation before recommended for designing naked figures by beginning with the osteology may with equal propriety be applied to the designing of draperies for as that method will be sound of the utmost utility for placing the muscles correctly so first designing the figure naked and afterwards proceeding to cast the drapery will be found in this point equally beneficial it will not be necessary to finish with that exactness which is required for such as are intended to remain in that state but the just proportion being given and the parts boldly marked the mistakes that are found in the performances of those who proceed with less caution will be prevented the best authors who have treated upon the manner of designing draperies concur in enforeing the utility of this method it will also be necessary in designing draperies to observe the following precepts carefully avoid overcharging the figure with an unnecessary quantity shew as much of the form of the body under it as possible where large draperies are requisite throw them into few folds but let those be large and graceful on the contrary loosen those from the body which are close and short by small folds judicioussy placed which will take off that stiffness which would be the consequence of their sitting too strait when much drapery is necessary let the greater part of it fif convenient be thrown into shadow observe to give tender shadows to those folds which fall in the lights that the hollow parts may not appear too deep and cutting let the folds be well contrasted and avoid strait lines as much as possible make the folds contrast the body and limbs judicious repetition of folds in circular form contributes greatly to characterise fore- shortened limb the drapery of figures moving with great activity should play as if agitated by the wind but that in proportion only to the velocity with which the figure appears to move on the contrary in fixt attitudes keep the drapery still ii numberless examples of fine draperies may be found in prints after the great masters but none are fitter to be consulted than those of the cartons let them be designed carefully and the artist will be better enabled to cast them himself in true taste when he afterwards makes designs from real draperies when the student has made considerable progress and is able to copy picture drawing or print with freedom and exactness let him proceed to finish his studies by considering the an- tique and nature the collection of casts from the antique statues at the royal academy for painting and sculpture are accessible to the ingenious it will be necessary to conclude with one useful caution let the student be careful how he studies the statues let him remember that the best of them are only memorials of the intense application of those great artists whose lives were spent in eadeavours to express their own idea of perfection which varied according to the different genius or taste of each master and the different nature of the materials he wrought upon and that those performances which come nearest to nature are the best and let it be further remembered that design correctly made after the finest statue will never convey any other idea than that of statue there is stiffness inse- parable from marble or plaster which is conveyed to and infallibly distinguishes the designs made after them from those made after nature and that stiffnefs should be avoided with the ut- most care and assiduity description of the cartons of raphael urbin when man enters into that awsul gallery at hampton-court ssays mr. richardson in his essay on the theory of painting he finds himself amongst fort of people superior to what he has ever seen and very probably to what those really were indeed this is speaking of grace and greatness the principal excellence of those wonderful pictures as it must be al- lowed to be that part of painting which is preferable to all others these inimitable pieces are called cartons from their being executed upon paper and are nothing more than coloured drawings upon washed ground previously prepared for that purpose the shadows of which are made by hatching with the point of large pencil and the whole are very highly finished they were originally intended as patterns for tapestry and were entirely the work of that great master raphael urbin it is almost impossible to consider these pictures without supposing that as the miraculous draught of fishies is the only miracle of our saviour ’ to be found among them it is more than probable that what this country now happily possesses is but part of most stu- pendous work of this great man and that many more glorious cartons of the life and miracles of our saviour have perished in oblivion for it can hardly be conceived that this single subject could particularly engage the attention of raphael among many others which would undoubt- edly have made better pictures and been more suitable to his genius and the carton of christ ’ charge to peter and the regular succession of the acts of the apostles seem greatly to confirm this opinion however as it is an argument that probably will not be contested and can not be proved it can only be lamented that perhaps some accident or the premature death of that great master has deprived the world of an invaluable treafure carton the miraculous draught of fishes and jesus said unto simon fear not from benceforth thou shalt catch men laujke ch.. was an amazing event but as the principal persons were few and half of them necessarily engaged in the management of their nets the historical expression is confined to three figures only which are those of our saviour peter and james the principal figure in this picture is christ who is pronouncing the words above quoted in order to remove the apprehension of peter who in fine posture of supplication has just uttered these words depart from me for am sinful man lord our saviour ’ figure and action are per- fectly great and graceful and in his character divinity benignity and tenderness are express- ed in the highest degree in peter ’ countenance fear wonder and solicitude are blended in most extraordinary manner and compose character of expression worthy of raphael the figure in the same boat supposed to be that of james is also finely imagined and drawn awe and attention are strongly marked in his face and he seems by his action to have acquiesced in the supplication of peter as acknowledging himself unworthy of being the companion of di- vinity ithe rest of the figures as has already been said are chiefly concerned in attending to description of the their employment which as they were in another vessel naturally engrossed their attention only the nearest of them seems to have caught some part of the conversation and appears to listen this last figure and another who are pulling up the net are finely drawn contrasted and foreshortened and the whole figure of the old man in the stern of the boat who is very attentive te his businéss is extremely fine the perspective in this carton in which the point of sight is placed pretty high occasions the sea to make fine back ground for the figures which from its natural hue fails not of shewing the colouring of the figures to the utmost advantage at great distance upon the sea-shore appear several groupes of figures designed in masterly manner the principal of which seems to consist of number of persons who are employed in the baptism of infants nothing need be said to the objection commonly made by small critics to the- size of the boats that having been fully answered by mr. richardson who has also mentioned the fine effect of the sea-fowl which are artfully and judicioussy placed in the fore-ground and indeed could be very ill spared carton ii christs charge to peter commonly called the delivery of the keys he said unto bim the tbird time simon son of jonas lovest thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto bim lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that lave thee jesus faith unto him feed my sheep jonn chap xxi ver principal figure in this picture is that of our saviour which mr. richardson is of opinion has received some injury and is not at present what raphael made it this supposition it is believed has never been contradicted and whoever attentively compares the taste of design in this figure with those of the apostles in the same carton or that of our sa- viour in the miraculous draught of fishes must be convinced that it falls many degrees short of that great painter perhaps by some who may contend for its being raphael ’ it may be urged that like leonardo da vinci in fimilar case he was baffled by thie greatness of his own idea but whichever argument holds good we must be content to take it as it appears mr. ri- chardson also observes that the time chosen is the moment of our lord ’ having just spo- ken and that in consequence of our saviour ’ interrogating peter lovest thou me more than these ’ the rest of the apostles were eager to reply to that question by assuring their lord that their love for him was at least equal to peter ’ and this solicitude is finely expressed in every character the next principal figure is that of peter who according to the history is re- presented upon his knees with the utmost humility attending to and receiving the charge given him by his divine master the head is dravn in profile and the face is entirely in shadow it may be here observed that the shadow cast by peter ’ body serves admirably to bring the figure of our saviour forward and also to keep the principal groupe together the third princi- pal figure is st. john whose expression and attitude mr. richardson mentions as an improve- mient upon the story he says our saviour by commanding peter to feed his sheep seemed to indicate preference in favour of that apostle as has been observed and that st. john who was the beloved disciple may therefore be supposed to have been under particular con- cern on that account accordingly he appears to address himself to our lord with extreme ar- dour as if earnestly endeavouring to convince him of the sincerity of his love the atten- tion of all the apostles is directed to our saviour except one who seems to press forward and by turning his liead which is seen between two profiles hinders the repetition which would have unavoidably happened if he had been looking the same way the heads of the apostles are amazingly designed and full of expression and their attitudes are finely varied and con- trasted thé draperies are noble and well cast that of our saviour only appears to be rather heavy and unsuitable to him at this time as being after his resurrection but admitting that this figure has suffered the injury may in this particular be attributed to the alteration of it by some other hand mr richardson who had studied the cartons observes that the small piece of drapery in part of the garment of the outermost apostie is of great consequence to this picture which being folded as under his arm breals the strait line of an unplcasing mafs of light and gives more graceful form to the whole which artifice is also assisted by the boat of the same consequence to the principal figure is the flock of ffieep placed behind which helps to break the lines of the drapery detach the figure from its ground and illustrate the history carton iii the lame man healed commonly called the beautiful gate of the templ es then peter said silver and gold babe none but fuch as have give thee in the name of jesus christ of nazaretb rise up and walk and be took bim by the right hand and lift bhim up and immediately bis feet and ancie bones received strength acts chap il ver great composition is divided into three distinct groupes by means of the magnificent columns which appear in the front of the picture and are part of the co- lonade which supports the roof of the portico the two apostles peter and john the cripple and four figures whose heads only are seen compose the groupe in the centre one side of the picture is filled with people going to the temple and its opposite with others coming from it which disposition raphael has advantageously employed in contrasting these two subordinate groupes by opposing the backs of some of the figures to others which are seen in front and further con- trasting these by several which are in profile there is not perhaps in the world picture so thoroughly characterised or so artfully managed as this carton the moment of peter ’ having pronounced the words in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk is the time chosen by raphael and is the instant when the lame man finds himself suddenly enabled to rise when the muscles of his limbs released from the contraction which till now with-held and deprived him of their use are expanding and an extraordinary impulse urges him to the exertion of their hitherto useless functions all which is most amazingly conceived and expressed at this period those who were apprized of something extraordinary which was then transacting are endeavouring to thrust forward on the side of the picture where the cripple is placed and these with woman and boy who are hastily passing on to the temple together with the inimitable boy in the front of the picture who is eagerly pulling back one of the figures remarkably characterise the princi- pal subject of the carton which is that of the agents of divine power giving strength and agility to the torpid limbs of the man who was born lame wonder and amazement are finely expressed in the characters of the spectators and on the side of the picture next to peter who with great dignity has conferred the divine gift every thing is still but expresling silent amazement thus in the parts where dignity should be preserved all is quiet and where strength and activity are given every thing is in motion the character of the cripple is sinely imagined it is persectly that of mean person and the expression of joy and gra- titude which appcars in it is finely balanced by mixture of doubt and astonishment and he seems scarcely to believe the reality of the blessing he is receiving the character of peter is devout and majestic jfand that of john is full of divinity and superlatively graceful he is represented with the utmost pity and affability concurring with peter in this act of true piety and charity the rest of the heads in the same groupe are finely invented and drawn particu- larly that of the old man leaning upon his crutch jand of him who is looking over john ’ shoulder iit is remarkable that the same airs of the head which raphael has given to the two apostles are nearly the same with those of the man and woman on that side of the picture and the action of peter ’ arm is repeated in the same man with very little variation he has also introduced another cripple into this groupe whose character is not altogether uilike that of him who is healed but the expression is of another kind and shews malevolence and disinclination to believe the truth of this miracle which seems to be one reason why he was placed behind the apostle as à situation most properly adapted to one of his way of thinking but this figure is of prodigious use and is moreover fine eontrast to the other and the repetition in the rest is so judicioussy managed that it has no ill effect but of this groupe particular notice will be taken in speaking of the by-works or ornaments of this carton there is wonderful expression of malignity in the character of the man who presses his lips with his singer in the same groupe the woman with the child in her arms has character full of expression is exquisitely designed and perfectly great and graceful ithe fine boy in the fore-part of the picture who being unconcerned is eager to be going and pulls the man ’ garment is à fine contrast to the figure of the cripple and at the same time breaks mass of shiadow which would otherwise have had very disagreeable effect this boy is also con- trasted by another who is led along hastily by woman with basket upon her head ff and these as has already been observed give motion to that side of the picture the drapery upon this woman ’ arm is artsully swelled and folded towards the elbow and breaks the straitness which would have appeared from her action and could not but have offended the eye it will now be proper to speak of the ornaments and other accidental decorations which are usually called bye-works the principal of these are the columns which with regard to the picture are the finest that could possibly be imagined and in themselves are proof of the amazing genius of raphael the effect of the waving line as an ornament is perhaps no where made use of to such advantage nor better proves its gracefulness to confirm this assertion let any one substitute in their stead or ideally substitute the lonic or corinthian or any other order and let it be enriched with flutings and all the decorations that can possibly be given to those orders and then compare it with raphael ’ what an astonishing alteration must ensuel how cutting how disagreeably heavy will the innovation appear and how very considerably must the picture suffer by the change besides as the columns were arbitrary and the painter had once deviated from the established rules he was at liberty to do what he pleased and therefore raphael has apparently made use of this licence for the purpose sollowing lt was doubtless necessary that the principal groupe should not only possess the centre of the picture but occupy more space than the others in order to maintain its character of distinction from the subordinate ones in consequence of which raphael has made the intercolumination greater between the first and second column than be- tween the second and third part of which is cut off by the side of the picture this being allowed it will not be difficult to give what is apprehended will be thought sufficient reason for the repetitions before mentioned and why the same number of figures nearly in the same attitudes the cripple excepted were introduced into this groupe it is certain that if this part of the picture had been otherwise managed than it is by too great variation in the attitudes from those of the principal groupe the inequality of the intercolumniation would have been more apparent and consequently every common observer would have taken the liberty of condemning it as an oversight in raphael the great artifice therefore is concéaled in the similitude of the figures which compose these groupes the same number are employed in both in the principal groupe the whole figure of the cripple is seen in the other the body is large but being upon his knees his legs are hid by the columin and the space occupied by his hand and arm which rests upon staff is by no means equivalent to the room gained by the disappearing of his legs and yet this staff and limb seem to fill up the space the distance from the knees of the cripple to the column is greater than that between the feet of the lame man and the sume column and boch being near the ground-line or front of the picture cause great deception he woman witl the child in her arms is similar to john but she is placed much nearer thie column jolin ’ arm is employed in holding the child and consequently does not appear and light well-falded piece of drapery supplies the place and forms mass which receives the shadowed parts of the cripple ’ head and body the man is in an attitude similar to that of ’ eter but the column is placed so as to be partly hid by his hand by which he expresses his astonissment falls exactly in the centre between the two columns as does that of peter in the principal groupe but lest this should be too remarkable the hand of the woman is seen close by it naturally and grace- fully applied to her breast and this with the infant ’ head make sufficient variation and does not in the least destroy the principal intention it being absolutely necessary to introduce the whole arm of the figure of the man and the hand being to be placed in the centre the arm is un- avoidably required to be bent rather more than that -of peter but this was not sufficient vari- ation and therefore kind of short open sleeve which reaches about half way down to the elbow was added and this also produces another variation to carry on this artifice in every part raphael judged it expedient to have the same number of figures in each groupe but whercas in the principal one there are three heads between that of john and the column and none be- tween that of his and peter ’ so in this there appears but part of one between the woman and the column and the other three are placed in the space between the man and woman the same artifice is also finely kept up in the distant colonade where in the same space two rows of the same columns appear in perspective and by their contrast occasion the distance between the columns on the opposite side to appear larger than it really is in short this carton is altogether the most consummate picce of art that probably ever was or ever will be produced carton iv the death of ananias but peter jaid ananias wby bath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land whilst it remained was it not thine cwne and after it was sold was it not in thine ovn powerà why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart à thou bast not lied unto men but unto god and ananias kearing these words fell down and gave up the ghoft and great fear came on all that heard these things acts chap ver all the various ways ordained by the almighty for putting period to the present exist- ence of human nature there is none so affecting or alarming as the stroke of sudden death whenever therefore this happens it appears more or less terrible to those who survive according to the state of the soul at that moment when it is separated from the body the death of ananias was therefore subject capable of exciting horror in an extraordinary de- gree supposing it to have been only common accident but the circumstance of his death was much more terrifying as it was manifestation of the divine wrath upon him who had not lied unto men but unto god this alarming event happened at time when the minds of the peo¬ ple were filled with the amazing things which they both saw and heard when universal benevo- lence possessed the hearts of those who adhered to the doctrine taught by the apostles there- fore such an event must have struck those who were witnesses to it with horror and reverence with detestation of the act itself and with reverential awe for the apostle whose fore-knowledge of the fraud practised by ananias made him openly accuse him in the words above mentioned raphael has told this story in manner worthy of his sublime genius and the time chosen is so very evident that it needs not be mentioned this carton is composed of three distinct groupes and ananias is the principal figure but it required no less than the profound skill of this great master to make him appear so the figure being prostrate by necessity must have appeared to some disadvantage had the spectators been all standing even though they had inclined as much as the two men who are stooping over him ra- phael therefore has most judiciously given all the figures in the fore part of the picture such atti- tudes as at once persectly correspond with the story and make the figure of ananias more conspicu- ous accordingly the subordinate figures are all either kneeling or stooping and these at the same time give an inexpressible dignity to the apostles who are standing and form distinct groupe in the middle of the back part of the picture in the centre of which peter is placed who is described as having just pronounced the accusation the whole figure of ananias is inimitably fine but the expression in his character is amazing there appears to be strongly marked in the features not only the stroke of death as corporcal suffering but the agonies of wounded conscience à from which immediately proceeds the writhing contorsions of the body and limbs the very extremi- ties of which appear to be contracted and convulsed the character of peter is also finely ima¬ gined and designed there is holy severity in his countenance which is inexpressibly great his attitude is majestié and though his situation is something remote it is impossible to avoid seeing that his is the second principal figure in the picture the whole groupe of apostles are characters of great dignity each seems collected within himself and revolving upon this terri- ble catastrophe and one of them who is next to peter appears with reverential awe to address himself to the almighty and is fine character horror fear and amazement are blended in the character of the man who is opposed to ananias who by his situation and attitude appears also to be rendering up his goods to the apostles and possibly was intended for joses called barnabas who is mentioned in the latter part of the preceding chapter and this figure makes the finest contrast imaginable to that of the dying man the woman next to him dis- covers her terror in manner perfectly adapted to her sex as well as the circumstances of the storys her féar compels her to turn round the natural preparative for flight and this occasions her figure to contrast that of the man before described in fine manner the character of john who is very properly employed in relieving the necessitous persons who compose part of one of the subordinate groupes is extremely graceful compassion and benevolence are strongly express- in his coutenance** and his action discovers that he not only relieves them with money but likewise bestows with it his advice and appears to exhort them to make proper use of it the apostle who seems to beckon to some who are supposed to be out of the picture to bear testimony of the punishment inflicted on ananias is character of great dignity and his attitude is finely varied from that of peter ’ yf the draperies in this carton are perfectly fine and extremely well cast particularly those of the apostles which are remarkably graceful and the folds finely disposed and contrasted that of ananias requires particular observation he has less than any other figure in the picture his arms legs and feet being entirely naked this possibly to some may appear absurd but it is fine artifice the violent agitation of the muscles is thereby made apparent and the limbs of the figures near him being mostly covered serve to shew his figure more distinctly and of course help to discover its consequence in short the whole composition of this picture is perfectly great and striking and is remarkable instance of the genius of raphael in the carton of the lame man healed there is luxury of fancy displayed in the ornaments with which it is enriched in this its grandcur dignity and effect are totally derived from the invention and disposition of the charac- ters ornaments there are none and the bye-works are extremely plain and agreeable to the sim- plicity of the church of christ in its infant state the chief of them is the curtain which is behind the apostles it is indeed simple but then it is finely folded and serves admirably to break the straight line which is made by the heads of the apostles which without this help must have appe red somewhat disagreeably the back ground is also artfully varied and relieved by an opening on one side and flight of steps with figures ascending them on the other cartons of raphael urbin elymas the sorcerer struck with blindnefs nd nou behold the hand of the lord is upon thee and thoit shalt be blind not seeing the light of the sun for à season and immediately there fell on him mist and darknefs and be went about seeking some to lead bim by the hand acts chap xin ver terror and astonishment are strongly expressed in this picture yet it appears of different kind and produces different effect from that in the carton of the death of ananias the punishment of elymas was to him dreadful and grievous and to the beholders terrifying and wonderful but is apparently considered by them no otherwise than as it relates to this instance of the divine judgment inflicted on him the death of ananias inspired horror also not without mixture of pity for the sufferer who before the discovery of his crime was probably esteemed as good and devout man on the contrary the sorcerer was person of whom it may reasonably be judged the people stood in awe and that he was rather feared on account of his power than beloved for his virtues this will evidently appear when the manner in which raphael has told this story is considered every one of the spectators discovers terror and surprise but none except one of the lictors who stands near the proconsul discovers the least expression of pity elymas though in the midst of numbers appears to be alone and he extends his arms in vain seeking some to lead him by the hand ’ nor does the admirable figure who stands between him and the proconsul and who with the utmost amazement looks stedfastly in his face seem inclinable to offer him the least assistance indeed there are but few of the spectators who appear to give any attention at all to him the majority of them being employed either in relating or attending to the relation of the punishment inflicted upon him elymas who is the principal figure in this picture according to the observation of mr. richardson is blind from head to foot and is altogether most inimitable character perhaps raphael hardly ever conceived one more expressive and though this great master thought proper to assist the understanding by making the subordinate figures more fully explain the principal subject yet this figure was alone sufficient to have done it dejected arrogance is amazingly described in his character ’ together with that shame and confusion which must natu- rally have appeared in it when he felt the irresistible force and superiority of the divine power his attitude is also extremely fine and can only be thoroughly understood by viewing the picture itself or good copy or print after it the apostle paul is the next principal figure he is placed opposite to the sorcerer and is represented with one arm extended as having just de- nounced sentence upon him to the execution of which with look of holy satisfaction he seems to demand the proconsul ’ attention he is likewise distinguished by book which he holds under the other arm in his character which appears in prosile the expression is awful and maiestic his whole figure is finely imagined and drawn full of dignity and perfectly graceful the next is the proconsul sergius paulus who is more affected than any of the spectators terror and astonishment are expressed in his countenancet and evidently discover that he feels the force and is sensible of the equity of the divine judgment but it appears in manner perfectly becoming his character and he sits amazed at the punishment of elymas and convinced of the truth of the doctrine preached by the holy apostles the apostle barnabas who stands be- hind the sorcerer is employed in explaining his fate to those who by their situation must necessarily be ignorant of it as being placed behind him which he is represented as doing with great zeal and energy ithe man who stands between elymas and the proconsul is prodigieusly fine he is indeed all amazement and attention and in his character there is express mixture of doubt and an eagerness to discover whether the sorcerer ’ blindness is real or not the man whose head appears between that of paul and the side of the picture is also full of expression he is apparently believer which is shewn by fine mixture of fear and devotion in description of the his countenance ’ there is likewise great expression in the lictors who stand upon the steps and also in the rest of the characters which compose this picture the draperies in general are extremely fine particularly that of paul which is noble well cast and folded that of the forcerer is also finely imagined and suitable to bis character the scenery or back ground of this carton is magnificent and well adapted it will be sufficient to say that in order to break the stiffnefs of unilormity raphael has taken some liberties in the architecture which produce an effect that makes ample amends for any seeming irregularity carton vi paul and barnabas at lystra and there sat certain man at lystra impotent in bis feet being cripple from bis mothers womb wbo never had walked the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding bim and perceiving that be had faith to be bealed said with loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked and when the people saw what paul had done they lift up their voices saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to us in the likenefs of men and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was chief speaker then the prieft of jupiter wbich was before their city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people which when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out acts chap xiv ver ê— this carton the simplicity and purity of the christian religion is finely opposed to the pompous idolatry and superstition of the heathens the divine behaviour and modesty of the two apostles is infinitely more striking and greater than all the tumult and parade of the sacrifice which the priests attended by the people are about to make to them the manner in which raphael has described this ceremony is perfectly fine and agreeable to the custom of the romans and is entirely taken from the bas-relief of the trajan column the priests and boys employed in the intended sacrifice being almost exactly copied from thence particularly the priest of jupiter who is in all respects the same except in the drapery the figure in the column being without any in the characters of the priests and people there is general expression of enthusiasm and superstitious fear which is finely described paul is the principal figure in this picture he is represented as standing upon kind of step from whence he is about to descend in order to stop the mistaken religious fury of the people and at the same time with the utmost grief and perturbation which is admirably expressed in his coun- tenance is rending his garment and exposes part of his breast which produces fine effect in the imagination the apostle barnabas who stands behind him is sine character he is seen intirely in shadow but his attitude and expression are incomparable grief and pity are blended in his countenance and he clasps his hands together with fervour not to be described mr. richardson in speaking of this carton and the sacrifice represented in it says the occa- sion of all that is finely told the man who was healed of his lameness is one of the for- wardest to express his sense of the divine power which appeared in those apostles and to shew it to be him not only crutch is under his feet on the ground but an old man takes up the lappet of his garment and looks upon the limb which lie remembered to have been crippled and expresses great devotion and admirations which sentiments are also seen in the other with mixture of joy mr. richardson might have added gratitude also and indeed if it be allowable to which is visibly expressed in the character of the cripple censure so great à master the place in which this man is found is liable to some objection paul in looking siedfastly upon him perceived he had faith to be healed ’ and he is here represented among the erowd of idolators and appears to be one of the most zealous to assist at cere- mony so utterly disagreeable to his holy benefactors to this it may be objected that as he pro- cartons of raphael urbin bably had not had time to be fully instructed in the christian faith this was the only way in which he could possibly testify his gratitude but it is submitted whether he might not with moré propriety and equal advantage to the picture have been introduced in the place of the man who is on the fame side of the picture with the apostles employed in bringing ram to the sacrifice à or at least in some other situation in this particular more agreeable to his dispo- sition to receive the religion of christ the whole figure of this man is finely designed and vastly exprefsive but the leg which the old man is looking at is remarkably elegant and was undoubtedly painted from nature the figure of the old man is also finely drawn and imagined and his attitude whiei is stooping brings several subordinate figures into view which cquld not otherwise have been seen the architecture in the back ground of this carton is magni- ficent the forms of the buildings are finely varied and the whole together exhibits noble composition carton vii paul preaching at athens then paul stood in the midst of mars-hill and said te men of athens perceive that in all tbings ye are too superstitious for as passed by and beheld your devotions found an altar with this inscription to the urknonr god wohom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare unto you acts chap xvii ver invention exprefsion design variety and decorum are allowed to constitute fine historical composition this carton certainly deserves the character it has long maintained of being one of the greatest performances of raphael this fine picture is divided into three groupes the first of which is composed of four figures among whom the apostle is eminently distinguished as indeed he is from every other in the picture his situation being so extremely remarkable that he is shewn to the greatest advantage that can possibly be conceived the man who is about to ascend the steps the woman behind him and eight other figures who are represented standing compose the second groupe and the third is formed by six persons who are sitting this last is placed between the first and second nearly in the centre of the picture the character of paul is universally allowed to be the most sublime performance that ever was produced by the pencil of raphael and mr. richardson who passionately admired this figure with warmth peculiar to himself swhich perhaps upon this and some similar occasions carried him little too farl says but no historian or orator can possibly give me so great an idea of that eloquent and zealous apostle as that figure of his does all the fine things related as said or wrote by him can not for there see person face air and action which no words can sufficiently describe but which asfure me as much as those can that that man must speak good sense and to the purpose thus much is be- yond contradiction that nothing hitherto produced can give so great an idea of the person of paul or can better help to illustrate the divine zeal and elocution which that apostle so eminently possessed than the awful majestic and expressive character which the hand of raphael has given themf raphael has employed every artifice in order to make the apostle particularly conspicuous all the figures in the picture are subservient to that purpose the man and woman at the bottom of the steps are actually nearer to the eye than the apostle but their situation causes the base line of the picture to cut off part of their height and as they are both stooping they are effectually prevented from lessening the importance of the apostle he has managed the figures that appear behind the apostle in the same manner by placing two of them lower than paul and the third sitting upon the upper step by which means they are sufficiently degraded the figures in thé second groupe who are seen standing are situated upon the ground their heads mostly inclined and are also at considerable distance and those who compose the middle groupe are at still greater distance and are represented sitting but the gigantic statue of mars which is introduced with great propriety is of infinitc service to the picture it is placed beyond the outermost figures of the second groupe therefore the distance of this statue being considered and the height and bulk of it compared with the figure of the apostle it will be found to reduce the last to moderate size and also serves admirably by its magnitude to balance that side of the picture among great variety of fine characters in this picture next to that of the apostles is that of the man who is ascending the steps in whose countenance awe and reverence are finely blended nor need the most common observer be told that this man and the woman behind him are intended to represent dionysius and damarisf who we are informed by the history were converted the expression of extreme attention in the three figures nearest to dionysius in the second groupe is most admirably describedf nor is that of the man in the same groupe who presses his lips with his finger less to be admiredi the three figures behind the apostle who are apparently displeased with his discourse are finely invented particularly that of him who is sitting and rests his chin upon his hand in his character envy and malignity are finely described** leonardo da vinci in his treatise upon painting has given it as precept that in grave and serious compositions when asfemblies arc held and matters of importance debated let but sew young men be present it being contrary to custom to intrust affairs of this nature in the hands of youth who are not less able to give council than they are willing to receive it and who therefore have two reasons for absenting themselves from these kinds of meetingsff- this precept is no where better illustrated than in this carton where there is wonderful ex- pression of attention decorum and gravity in the old men and on the contrary the few voung persons who are introduced in the picture appear froward impatient and impetuous and con- tempt and dislike are strongly expressed in each of their characters for which reason part of these turbulent persons are judiciously thrown into the most distant groupe and others are placed behind the older men in the distance between the buildings in the centre of the picture are seen two sigures who appear to be talking together and seem to be of no consequence to the composition but their use is great they not only serve to break the straight line made by the heads of those who are sitting as also the parallel lines made by the columns of the temple and the adjacent piazza but connect the principal and two subordinate groupes together and without them the picture must have suffered considerably the attitudes of the figures are extremely sine and expressive the draperies noble and well cast particularly that of the apostle which is admirably designed the architecture is elegant not rich but suitable to the taste of the athenians and properly adapted to the picture as is the distant view of the country it being customary for them to place the statue of mars as the guardian of the city at the entrance into it upon the whole it may not be improper to conclude with comparing the ideas of two such great painters as raphael and leonardo da vinci in similar subjects by the following extract from the writings of the latter who in describing the manner in which public oration should be represented says to represent person haranguing multitude consider in the first place the subject matter on which he is to entertain them in order to give him an action suitable to the occasion for instance if the business be to persuade let it appear in his gestures if it be to argue and deduce reasons let him hold one of the fingers of his left hand between two of those of the right keeping the other two shut let his face be turned to the asfembly and his mouth half open so as that hie may appear to speak if he be sitting let him seem as about to rise advancing his head little forwards if he be represented standing let him recline little with his head and breast towards the people and let the assembly be seen listening with silence and attention let all their eyes be fastened on the speaker and let their actions discover somewhat of admiration let some old man be seen wondering at what he hears with his mouth shut his lips drawn close wrinkles about the corners of his mouth the bottom of his checks and in the forehead occasioned by the eye- brows which must be raised near the setting on of the nose let others be represented sitting with their fingers clasped within each other bearing up their left knee another old man may be seen with his knees thrown across each other his elbow leaning on his knee and with his hand supporting his chin which may be covered with venerable beard the similarity of the ideas of these two great men will be better discovered by comparing the carton with the foregoing quotation where though several things are differently expressed yet upon the whole the thought is so nearly alike that it might be almost implied that either leo- nardo ’ idea had been put in execution by raphael or could there have been probability of it that the latter had dictated to the former when he was composing his book passions fear and astonishment and awe and devotion and wonder and amazement and reverence horror
