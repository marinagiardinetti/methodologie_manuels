the patronage of those whom taste and genius inspire with the love of them and whose rank and fortunes may afford that support and en- couragement without which they would languish and droop- in shade and obscurity dedication the want of this encouragement is possibly one reason why these arts have never flourished among uncivilized uncul- tivated nations who confined by too exact an equality to the sole view of procuring the necessaries of life have nei- ther inclination nor leisure to pursue and cultivate ornaments and elegancies that distinguish the polite parts of the world an easy situation and freedom from the distresses of neces- sity depressed with which the strongest natural genius strug- gles in vain to exert itself are only to be found in the favour and protection of the noble the wealthy and the powerful to this cause perhaps europe owes its superiority over climates equally blest with that happy temperature which might naturally inspire the noblest inventions and excite and animate the ambition of excelling let this reason my lord excuse the presumption of beg ging leave to shelter this work under your lordship patronage your love for the art of painting will hope dispose you to favour an attempt to restore that essential branch of it which is the subject of the ensuing treatise the decline of which has been universally acknowleged and lamented and at the same time your judgment formed on knowlege of its principles and conversation with the best works of the greatest masters must prove à sufficient pro- tection and recommendation to the world here my lord might indulge the warmth of my heart could be tempted to expatiate on character that would employ employ the utmost of the painter ’ skill without incurring the imputation of what we are so often accused of flattery but drop the pencil though pretend to some skill in colours mine are all too faint for the subject and will not daub what can not adorn the many favours and benefits your lordship has heaped upon me make this but an offering of gratitude most strictly due and upon this topic can never say enough nor no- thing should induce me to be inclined but as am sure it would be disagreeable to your lordship to hear à repetition of those favours your generosity made it pleasure to confer may you be long haf in the pleasing power of making others so and may every object of your beneficence retain the same grateful sense of it and make the same return in sincere devotion to your service with my lord tour lordsbip most obliged moft bumble and most obedient servant bardwell the practise of painting introduction tis an observation of pliny that the ancients painted with four colours only and out of them made all their teints monsieur de piles is of opinion that it was out of these they made their grounds or what we call the dead-colouring how it really was time has put it out of our power to determine but if we suppose those four principal colours in perfection then ithink it can be no longer doubted but that from them might be made all the various colours in nature for my part can not believe that the four capital colours of the antients would mix to that surprising perfection we see in the works of titian and rubens and if we have no certain knowlege of their method of colouring who lived in the last century how should we understand theirs who lived near two thousand years ago and why the method and practice of colouring which was so introduction well known to rubens and van dyck should not be continued down to the present masters is to ine surprising must confess ihave often thought and still believe that those painters who had acquired so sine manner of colouring might if they pleased have communicated it to posterity in writing but never heard that any attempt was made towards it tho ’ ’ tis probable there might be some it is astonishing nevertheless all europe should suffer alike at the same time for want of that noble franknefs and generous spirit which might have been expected from those masters and which would have done the world more service than their pictures it is plain from the works of their pupils that they knew it because in their pictures we see the same sort of colours and colouring and from the little variety of capital colours and sameness of method used by them it is not to be doubted but the whole was contained in few principles neither difficult nor tedious if we trace the art through its several declensions we shall find rembrandt who was master of all the parts of colouring in the highest degree lived to the year next to him was zoust who died in england about eight years after lely lived to the year reily who was zouff ’ disciple survived them and was left the best colourist we had mr. richardson who died about the year was his pupil but in my opinion in point of merit much his inferior reily think declined in the same proportion to zoust that zoust did to rembrandt as all these masters from rembrandt sunk gradually below each other in the art of colouring we may with certainty date the declension of that art from him can not attribute this gradual degeneracy in the knowlege of so charm- ing an art to any thing but inability or want of that generofity have before mentioned or both tho ’ these gentlemen were not able to give us so perfect an account as the great masters yet they might have com- municated what they learned from them and if it was against their own private interest to have published it whilst they practised they should out of general regard to men of taste and to the art itself have left it behind them to have given to posterity an opportunity of reaping the benefit of their studies flatter myself that the following sheets compiled originally for my own use contain something that may be of consequence in studying this art and hope the practicable method of colouring here laid down which has been the result of much study and long experience and which now use will be found both useful and agreeable in the course of studying this part of my art as could have no assistance from the living found myself obliged to make my court to the dead mean their works and tho have had very little op- portunity to study even them yet from the few have copied have after tedious course of mistakes at last by mere dint of labour and the assistance of genius such as it is found the following method of colouring very easy and expeditious painters says de piles spend many tears in the search of knowlege wbich they might bave attained in little time bad they bit at first upon the right path this truth have experienced and confess that the works of van dyck and rembrandt are the surest guides to nature it is out of these most excellent masters that have established my method it is from their pictures have found the first lay of colours and from them have learned the virgin teints and finishing secrets tho have always applied them to practice from nature in the method of my work begin with short and plain account of the principal colours used in the flesn next follow with the principal teints first painting ot dead-colouring second painting third or last painting of painting back-grounds some remarks on copving of drapery-painting of landscape-painting new short and familiar account of the art of perspective all these particulars have endeavoured to make familiar clear and instructive without design to flatter or offend and thro ’ the whole course of the work have had the utmost regard to truth the motive of my publishing is solely the benefit of the art such as are born with happy genius tho destitute of master or guide may from these instructions acquire competent knowlege of colour- ing alinost without studying here the lovers of painting who study for their pleasure and amusement may be conducted easily step by step to the secrets of that art which of all the designing ones affords per- haps the greatest pleasure to the mind it may be objected to me by some that my own works do not shew have either acquired or revived that art which according to my own confession has long time lain dormant am not the proper person to answer this objection nevertheless have some copies by me that will leave to judges to compare in this point with any painting that has been done for the last sixty or seventy years and believe could con- vince any artist even at twice painting head from the great masters that my method will certainly answer to all their variety of colouring and sure every sensible painter will grant that that method which comes nearest to van dyck and rembrandt will certainly be the nearest way to nature since li have establissied myself in these principles must inform the reader that find no difference in the method of the working between copying and painting from nature had known at my first setting out as much as have since learned should have approached much nearer to those great masters others who have the advantage of youth may am persuaded attain the end propose it is for them that write and most sincerely wish the rules lay down may contribute to restore so divine an art monsieur de piles says titian and rembrandt prepared their first lay er grounds very near alike and with colours that kindly united and were as near to tbe life as possible on which they laid their virgin teints with light strokes of the pencil and thus they imitated the force and fresbness of nature nature they were convinced that there were certain colours wbich destroyed each other if they were mixed to excess and that they should be as little shaken as possible by the motion of the pencil lt would be folly in any man at this present time to assume so much knowlege in the art of painting as monsieur de piles really had who was man of genius and learning that made painting his principal study and travelled on purposo to complete his knowlege in that delight- ful art was intimately acquainted with thie painters in his time who assisted him in studying the works of the great masters which he care- fully examined and from which he made his reflections and judicious remarks this was when the works of van dyck and rembrandt were more in perfection and in an age when painting was better understood is it poffible for any thing to be more plain and intelligible than these two most excellent remarks of monsieur de piles which contain the principal matter and foundation of colouring this is vastly different from theirs whose colouring is as they pretend to change and wear to the complexion tho ’ this may answer their purposes yet none that study the art of colouring will hope believe it it is certainly true that the great masters imitated nature in their first painting or dead-colour- ing so far as they could without dirtying the colours omitting only the finishing touches and colours that should come last which design to shew in the course of this work in the most intelligible manner can and exactly to the rules and method of my present practice some painters imagine the great masters had colours which we have no knowlege of and it is probable they might yet confess see none in the pictures of van dyck and rembrandt but what are common to painters only some of them are better than ours which would be reme- died if that art was more encouraged by the painters those we have am convinced would appear much finer if they were laid on proper grounds painter should have as great regard to his first lay as he has to the succeeding parts of his work sir godfrey kneller in lelys time studied his manner and prepared his grounds and- first lay of colouts introduction on such cloths as lely used but after his death he soon fell into slighter manner which was more agreeable to his genius and inclination and invented the cold grey-coloured cloths on which he established his slight cxpeditious manner then was the time when the painters exposed their understanding in neglecting the charming stile of van dyck to follow kneller but tho colouring was not his talent yet he was in his time the best face-painter in europe nor has there been an artist since him whose heads can stand any comparison with his aster him co- louring hunig here for some time between the manners of mr. richardson and rosalba the followers of the latter failing in oil established her method having traced the art of painting thro ’ its several declensions will venture to give my opinion on it as it stands at this present time in regard to portraiture and hope to do it in such manner as to offend no-body that may differ from me if may be allowed to judge from the pictures brought home by gentlemen from abroad as the works of ghe most eminent living masters may without partiality affirm that face-painting is no-where so well performed as in england notwithstand- ing the prejudices of some in favour of foreigners nor is it at all sur- prising it should be so since where there is the greatest encouragement to an art thither the most eminent masters in that art will resort and there it will be improved to its greatest height it is well known that no nation in the world delights so much in face-painting or gives so generous encouragement to it as our own and it is equally known that no country affords such helps in regard to beautiful nature we have also the greatest number of van dyck ’ pictures and the rest of the best face-painters rembrandt excepted of any people and it seems rea- sonable from these observations which are founded on matter of fact to infer that england is preferable to all other nations whatsoever in this respect and the best place for studying the art of face-painting can not but indulge fort of compassion for those artists as do for other mistaken men who conceive it absolutely necessary to traverse italy and other countries wasting thattime abroad which in my humble opi- nion may be employed at least as well at home in studying the works of van dyck and the inimitable beauties of the english ladies which think as much preferable to the antiques as the animated beauties of nature are to the cold imitations of her in stone am informed there is scheme on foot to establish an academy for painting and sculpture wish it may succeed as it must probably in time improve those arts to the highest perfection and will of course do honour to the nation and to the nobility who will from frequenting it for their amusement learn the principles of those arts and so become real judges of the principal coloues used in the flesh from wbich all tbe teints are made lake-white ofine white is the very best white we have this colour should be ground with the finest poppy oil than can be made at present our white is bad on account of the oil which is not really poppy white is friendly working colour and comes forward with yellows and reds but retires with blues and greens it is the nature of all whitee to sink into whatever ground they are laidt on therefore they should be laid on white grounds ivory-black is the best black we have it is colour which- sympathizes and mixes kindly with all the others it is true shade for blue lvory-black and little indian red make the best general shadow- colour that can be it is ground with linseed oil and used with drying oil black is cold retiring colour ultramarine is the finest blue in the world it is tender retiring colour and never glares and is beautiful glazing colour lt is used with pop oil prussian is very fine blue and kind working colour it is ground with linseed oil tho think nut oil is more proper it should never be used in the flesh but in the green teint and the eyes light oxer is friendly mixing colour and of great use in the flesh lt is usually ground with.linseed oil but nut oil is better- all yellows are strengthened with reds and weakened with blues and greens lightrep is nothing but fine light oker burnt this and white in mixing produce the most perfect flefh-colour that can be made it is beautiful clean kind -working colour but too strong for the white and therefore will grow darker it should be ground and used with nut oil novermillion but what is made of the true native cinnabar should ever be used it will not glaze but is fine colour when it is glazed it is ground with linseed oil and should be used with-drying oil carmine is the most beautiful crimson that can be it is middle colour between lake and vermillion is fine working colour and glazes delightfully it should be ground with nut oil and used with drying oil lake is tender sympathizing deep red but of no strong body therefore it should be strengthened with indian red it is the beft glazing colour that can be used it is ground with linseed oil and used with drying oil i iindian rep is à strong pleasant working colour but will not glaze well and when mixed with white falls little into the lead it is ground and used as the lake ii brown pink is fine glazing colour but of no strong body dn the flesh it should never join or mix with the lights because this colour and white antipathize and mix of warm dirty hae for which reason their joinings should be blended with cold middle teint in glazing of shadows it should be laid before the other colours that are to enrich it it is one of the finisning colours and therefore should never be used alone in the first painting it is strengthened with burnt umber teints and weakened with terraverte ground with linseed oil and used with drying oil burntumber is sine warm brown and good working strong colour lt is of great use in the hair and mixes finely with the warm shade of the principal teirts that are absolutely necessary for painting fiesn all wbich are made from the principal colours light red teint is made of light red and white it is the most kind and best conditioned of all colours for the general ground of the flesh with this colour and the shade-teint we should make out all the flesh like claro obscuro or mezzontinto we should also remember that this colour will grow darker because it is in its nature too strong for the white therefore we should improve it that is mix some vermillion and white with it in proportion to the fair- ness of the complexion and tho ’ it is thus mixed yet ishall call it the light-red teint in all the course of the work because would not have the vermillion teint confounded with it as if there was no difference vermillion teint is only vermillion and white mixed to middle teint lt is the most brilliant light-red that can be it agrees best with the white light-red and yellow teints carmineteint is carmine and white only mixed to middle teint it is of all colours the most beautiful red that can be for the cheeks and lips it is one of the finishing colours and should never be used in the first painting but laid upon the finishing colours without mixing rose teint is made of the red shade and white mixed to middle degree or lighter it is one of the cleanest and most delicate teints that can be used jà the flesh for clearing up the heavy dirty colours and therefore inschanging will sympathize and mix kindly yellow teint is often made of naples yellow and white but make it of light oker and white which is good working colour remember the oker is too strong for the white therefore we should make à little allowance in using it it follows the light-red teints and should always be laid before the blues if we lay too much of it wt may recover the ground it was laid on with the light-red teints blue teint is made of ultramarine and white mixed to azure it is pleasant working colour with it we should blend the gradations it follows the yellows and with them it makes the greens and with the red it produces the purples no colour is so proper for blending down or softening the lights into keeping leadteint is made of lvory-black and fine white mixed to middle degree it is fine retiring colour and therefore is of great use in the gradations and in the eyes greenteint is made of prussian light oker and white this colour will dirty the lights and should be laid sparingly in the middle teints it is most used in the red shadows where they are too strong it is of dirty antipathizing nature shade-teint is made of lake indian red black and white rixed to beautiful murrey colour of middle teint this is the best colour for the general ground of shadows for which reason call it the shade-teint it mixes with the lights delightfully and produces pleasant clean colour little inclined to the redish pearl as all the four colours of its composition are of friendly sympathizing nature so conse- quently this will be the same and therefore may be easily changed by the addition of any other colours rep shade is nothing but lake and very little indian red it is charming working colour and good glazer lt strengthens the shadows on the shade-teint and receives when it is wet the green and blue teints agreeably it is good ground for all dark shadows ii warmshade is made of lake and brown pink mixed to middle degree it is fine colour for strengthening the shadows on the shade-teint when they are wet or dry we must take care that it does not touch the lights because they will mix of dirty snuff-colour and therefore should be softened with tender cold teint dark shade is made of lvory-black and little indian red only this colour mixes very kindly with the red shade and sympa¬ thizes agreeably with the middle teints in the dead-colouring it is charming glazing colour for the eye-brows and darkest shadows it is of all the most excellent shadow-colour and one of the finest working colours we have first painting the colours and teints that are necessary for the first painting of the flesh fine white light oker -- -and its two teints light red and its two teints vermillion -- -—and its teint teint made of lake vermillion and white rose teint blue teint lead teint green teint half-shade teint -- is made of indian red and white shade-teint red shade warm shade the finishing pallet for fine complexion requires six more viz carmine and its teint lake brown pink lvory-black and prussian blue first painting the first painting or dead-colouring divide into two parts the first call the first lay or ground the second the laying on the virgin teints the first lay of colours consists of two parts the one is the work of the shadows only and the other that of the lights the work of the shadows is to make out all the drawing very cor- rectly with the shade-teint in the same manner as if it was to be done with this colour only and remember to drive or lay the colour sparingly the lights should be all laid in with the light-red teint in different de- grees as we see them in nature these two colours united produce clean tender middle teint for mixing with the shade-teint they turn to pearly hue and by strengthening them with the light-red we may work to very good resemblance in uniting the lights and shades we should use long softener about the size of large swan ’ -quill which will help to bring the work into character and leave the colour- ing more delicate then go over the darkest shadows with the red or warm shade which will finish the first lay the warm shade being laid on the shade-teint improves it to ¬ warmer hue but if laid instead of the shade-teint it will dirty and spoil the colours it mixes with and if the red shade be laid first inftead of the shade-teint the shadows would then appear too red and bloody therefore notwithstanding these two colours are the best that can be for the shadows yet they are too strong to be laid alone which is proof of the great use and merit of the shade-teint here we may observe that the shade and light-red teints are so friendly and delicate in their natures that they will not dirty tho we are continually changing them how proper then and agreeable to our purpose are they for making the most principal part of the likeness when in altering and changing they always produce clean colour of the inviting pearly hue the second part of the first painting in order to finish the first painting improve the reds and yellows to- the complexion and after them the blues observing that the blues on the reds make the purple and on the yellows produce the green the same method is to be understood of the shadows but be sure to leave them clean and not too dark therefore allowance should be made in their grounds with the light-red because glazing them will make them darker when the cloth is of dark or bad colour there must be strong body of colour laid all over the shadows such as will not sink into the ground but appear warm and little lighter than the life so that it may be of the same forwardness to finish as if it had been light ground therefore the business of dead-colouring is that we leave it always in the same order for-finishing tho ’ the colour of the cloth be quite the reverse am convinced by experience that the grounds of shadows in what we call the dead-colouring should be such as will support the character of the finishing colours which ground must be clean and little lighter than the finishing colours isay little lighter because the finishing of shadows is glazing and no other method but glazing can leave such brilliancy and beauty as they ought to have for find that glazing the shadows in the first painting is not so proper as laying body of shadow- colours that are very near to the life tho ’ little lighter these may be glazed and touched upon when dry with great deal of ease but if we begin the first painting with glazing we shall find it will stare and be of no use and the solid colours which are laid on it will look heavy and dull therefore all shadows and colours that are to be glazed should be done with colours of clean solid body because the glazing is more lafting and has the best effect on such colours remember to leave no roughness mean such as will appear rough and interrupt or hurt the character of the finishing colours which by examining the work whilst it is wet with soft tool or when it is dry with aknife may be avoided as it will easily take off the knots and roughest parts.. the light-red and white improved is superior to all other colours for the first lay or ground which should be always done with full pencil of stiff colour made brighter than the life because it will sink little in drying the greater the body and quantity of colour and the stiffer it is laid the less it will sink every colour in drying will sink and partake in proportion to its body of the colour it is laid on therefore all the lights of the flesn if not laid on light ground must conse- quently change little from the life if there is no allowance made the shade-teint for the shadows should fall into the rose teint as the com- plexion grows delicate all which should be lightly united with soft long pointed dsog-toel to thelights making out the whole like mezzotinto believe the great masters very seldom sweetened or softened the co- -lours but in uniting the first lay they were very careful in preserving the brightness of their colours and therefore did not work them below the complexion for to force or keep up brilliancy in the grounds can only be done with the whites reds and yellows which method will make up for the deficiency of the white grounds therefore the first paieting should be left bright and bold and the less the colours are broken the better we should forbear using any colours that will prejudice them and be contented to add what is wanted the next painting where if we fail clean rag will restore the first ground second painting the second painting begins with laying on the least quantity that can be of poppy oil then wipe it aliost all off with dry piece of silk handkerchief tlie secondpainting is also divided into two parts one call the first lay of the second painting which is scumbling the lights and glazing the shadows the other finishing the complexion with thevirgin teints and improving the likeness as far as we can without daubing scumbling is going over the lights where they are to be changed with the liglit-red teints or some other of their own colours such as will always clear and improve the complexion with short stiff pencils but such parts only as require it otherwise the beauty of the first painting will be spoiled and we make ourselves double work the light-red teint improved is the very best colour that can be for scumbling and improving the complexion in general where the shadows and and drawing are to be corrected we should do it with the shade-teint by driving the colour very stiff and bare that we may the- easier retouch and change it with the finishing teints some parts of the shadows should be glazed with some of the transparent shadow-colours such as will improve and come very near to the life but be sure not to lay on too much of itafor fear of losing the hue of the first painting the ground of which should always appear through the glazing be very careful in uniting the lights and shades that they do not mix dead and meally for the more the lights mix with the shades the more meally those shades will appear thus far the complexion is prepared and improved in-order to receive the virgin teints and finishing touches the second part of the second painting ls to go over the complexion with the virgin teints these are the colours which improve the colouring to the greatest perfection both in the lights and shadows this should be done in the same manner as we laid them in the second part of the firft painting that is with the reds yellows and blues blending them with delicate light touches of the tender middle teints without softening we should leave the teits and their grounds clean and distinct and be content to leave off whilst the work is safe and unsullied leaving what is farther required for the next sitting for in attempting the finishing touches before the other is dry we lose the spirit and drawing and dirty where-ever we touch the third painting or finishing tis to be supposed the complexion now wants very little more than few light touches therefore there will be no occasion for oiling begin with correcting all the glazing first where the glazing ferves as ground or under part then we should determine what should be done the part with one stroke of the pencil by this method we preserve both back-grounds the glazing and the teints but if it happens that we can not lay such variety of teints and finisning colours as we intended it is much better to leave off while the work is safe and in good order because those few touches which would endanger the beauty of the colouring mapeasily be done if we have patience to stay till the colours are dry and then without oiling and those finishings with free light strokes of the pencil believe that rembrandt touched upon his best pictures great many times letting them dry between it was this method most certainly which gave them that surprising force and spirit which is so inimitable find it much easier to soften the over-strong teints when they are dry than when they are wet because we may add the very colours that are wanting without endangering the dry work if any of the colours of the pallet want to be little changed to the life when we are painting it is much better to do it with the knife on the pallet than with the pencil because the knife will mix and leave it in good order for the penci of back-grounds van dyck made out the keeping in his back-grounds more from the different opposition and harmony of the colours than from his knowledge of the claro obscuro confess can not find in his pictures that intelligence of light and shade which is so striking and beautiful in rembrandt ’ van dyck ’ general method was to be very still and mellow and to break the colours of the ground with those of the drapery this will certainly produce harmony the principles of which method belong only to the art of colouring but it is the knowlege of light and shade which gives that surprising force and strength which at first sight we find in rembrandt ’ works have seen picture of lady where he has made the ground just light enough to shew her complexion and hair which was dark brown in the greatest perfection the ground was wall which near to the face was lighter than the shadows of the flesh and the light diminished so artfully in the gradations that though the part round the head was much darker yet it appeared to be of the same colour with that near the flesn must own like this method of relieving the head from the ground better than van dyck ’ method where he has made the ground almost of the same colour with the hair and though admire his way of breaking the colours of the ground with those of the draperies yet am not so much plcased where there appears too near sameness as have seen in some of his pictures where he has carried this principle so near that it is almost imperceptible in rembranct pictures at yarmouth the lights and shades are as visible as those in his prints and are remarkably broad clear and still the shadows are very warm and thin and look as if they were painted all at once with plenty of colour which appears transparent which transparency was done by glazing the dead colouring the principal colours that are necessary for painting of back-grounds in portraiture as walls buildings or the like are white black indian red light and brown oker prussian and burnt umber from which the eight principal teints are made as follows pearl is made of black white and little indian red lead of black and white mixt to dark lead colour yellow of brown oker and white olive of light oker prusfian and white flesh of indian red and white mixt to middle teint murrey of indian red white and little black mixt to kind of purple of middle teint stone of white umber black and indian red dark-shade of black and indian red only here the lead teint serves for the blues the flefn teint mixes agree- ably with the lead and the murrey is very good blending colour and of great use where the olive is too strong the umber white and dark shade will produce fine variety of stone colours the dark shade and umber used plentifully with drying oil make charming warm shadow-colour all the colours should be laid with drying oil only because they mix and fet the better with the softener where the marks of the trowel are so strong in the priming of the cloth that one body of colours will not be sufficient to conceal it we should lay colour to prevent it which should be dry before we begin with those parts that we expect to finish at once painting tiie method of painting back-grounds divide into two parts the first part is the work of the first lay the second is to follow on that with the finishing teints of the first lay we should always begin from the shadowed side of tiie head and paint- the lights first from them go into the gradations and shadows which should be done with large stiffisn tool very sparingly with the dark shade and white little changed with the colours that will give it more of the required hue but very near in regard to tone and strength leaving them like mezzotinto the dark and warm shadows should be laid before the colours that join them this we should do with the dark shade and umber drove with drying oil say before the colours that join them because if those colours were laid on first they would interrupt and spoil the trans- parency which is their greatest beauty the more the first lay is drove the easier and better we may change it with the finishing teints there- fore we may lay them with the greater body the second part is to follow directly whilst the first lay is wet with those teints that we think are most proper to harmonize and finish with begin with the lights first and remember as we heighten and finish them we do it with warmer colours and let those be accompanicd with fine tender cold teints the lightest part of the ground is always nearest to the shadowed side of the head this is the part which govefhs all the rest and should be painted with avariety of light warm clear colours which vanisn and lose their strength imperceptibly in the gradations these these should be laid with kind of cloudy touch rather than spotted and we must take care that we do not cover too much of the first lay but consider it as the principal colour from the lights we go to the gradations and shadows for when the lights are well adapted to produce and support the head it is easy think to fall from them into whatever kind of shadows we shall find most pro- per for our work then soften and blend the whole with long large hog-tool which with the strength and body of the drying oil will melt and sweeten all together in such flattering manner as will seem surprise- ingly finisned remember the teints will sink and lose little of their strength and beauty in drying all the grounds as walls should be finissied at once painting but if they want to be changed we may glaze them with little of the dark shade and drying oil drove very bare on which with few light touches of the colour that is wanting we may improve their hue the dark shadows may also be strengthened and im- proved by glazing which should be done after the figures are near finished for fear of making them too strong see rembrandt ’ grounds are rather brighter in the lights and have more variety of teints than any other painter ’ and to be sure he had observed and justly too that those teints diminish in proportion with the lights therefore his shadows have but faint appearance of teints he understood the gradations in perfection by mixing and breaking the first lay of colours so artfully that they flatter us in regard to their real strength fresnoy says let the field or ground of the picture be pleusant free tranfient light and well united with colours which are of friendly nature to each otber and ef such mixture as that there may be sometbing in it ef every colour that composes your work as it were the contents of your pallet de piles says variety of teints very near of the fame tone employed in the same figure and often upon the fame part with moderation contri- bute much to harmony all the curtains should be dead-coloured when we paint the ground and should be done with clean colours of near hue to the intended curtain curtain such as will support the finishing colours do it with tender sort of keeping and near in regard to their tone in the lights but much softer in the shadows all which should be mixed and broken with the colours of the ground and as fresnoy says bodies that are back in the ground should be painted with colours allied to those of the ground itself it will often happen for want of the life or some design that we can not make the folds the first painting we should then leave the massés of light and shadow in regard to the keeping of the picture broad and well united together such as may seem easy to finish on the colours of the landskip in back-grounds should be broke and softened also with those of the parts which join them this method brings them into keeping which will make all the parts of the ground as it were of one piece so that the different parts do not stare nor cut at their extrea- mities the sky should be broke with the lead and the flefh téints the murrey teint is of great use in the grounds of distant objects and the umber and dark shade in the near grounds the greens should- be more beautiful than we intend them because they will fade and grow darker after all is painted we should go over the whole very lightly with the softener as we did the grounds which will make it look agreeably finished on copying the author of the analyfis of beauty has given his opinion of copying in his true spirit and genius treating with ridicule one of the most useful parts of painting this impute to his want of skill in this branch of the art or to most ill-grounded prejudice for is it reasonable to believe that painter who understands the true merit of copying would treat that part of the art with contempt which the greatest masters have always practised and esteemed men of common sense know that the artists in all ages have copied and studied each either in whatever they found most for their purpose and for the advance- ment copying ment of their art was it not for this the art itfelf would soon dwindle and decay and fwisn this has not been the case with us rubens studied principally the works of titian paul veronese and tintoret that is he copied such of their pictures as he thought most worthy his imitation and kept them for his own use van dyck copied titian and all the venetian school or in de piless phrase saimmed their cream teniers is celebrated for transforming him- self into as many masters as he copied which he did so exactly that it is hard to distinguisn the copies from the originals hanneman ’ copies of van dyck are taken for the originals of that great master have seen copies by stone sold at great prices for undoubted originals notwith- standing they were divested of that free pencilling and charming variety of teints which are so apparent in van dyck buckshorn was one of the last good copiers we have had in england the-rest that followed him and his master lely soon dwindled to half-artists there is copy of buck- sborn ’ painting after van dyck which like much better than any of stone ’ mean the picture of the earl of strafford and his secretary in- the marquis of rockingham ’ collection which is well painted and de -- servedly esteemed believe every one that has heard of andrea del sarto ’ copy of leo the tenth painted by rapbael and julio romano will be convinced of the great use and merit of an art to which is owing that great number of originals now abounding in every country by originals mean pictures imposed as such by our ingenious and honest dealers to adorn the cabinets of the virtuosi and connoisseurs it is surprising that since the age of these great masters we have not had man able to make fine copy from any one of their pictures and ibelieve if such genius should hereafter arise it is to be feared the de- stroyers of the art if they are suffered to go on will scour off the remains off their beauties so that very little will be left for him to study and by the end of this century there will be none fit for copying it copying it is in vain for man to think of making fine imitation of any of the great masters without being thoroughly acquainted with the nature of colours and of colouring and without being clearly con- vinced at sight of the picture hie is going to copy of the method and principles on which it was painted it is the want of this knowlege and conviction which leads us into so many errors and mistakes painter that has acquired any sort of manner will always tincture his copying with the same now -- days we are too apt to fall into manner before we understand the nature of colours which is the case where some predominant colour or hue appears in all the complexions alike for this reason painter whose carnations are too red will cer- tainly make his copies blushi or if his colouring and shadows be heavy they will of course fall into the obscuro by the same rule whatever teints infect his colouring the same will unavoidably taint his copying for which there is no cure because he himself is infected monsieur de piles says it is very rare to change bad manner in colour- ing for better that raphael michael angelo leonardo da vinci julio romano and other great masters spent their wbole lives without truly understanding good colouring and tho colouring is the principal excel- lence in copying yet it is necessary that every artist should avoid particular manner with his pencil otherwise it will certainly be seen in his work from what has been said on this subject apprehend it appears that the art of copying which was practised by the great masters in order to catch each other ’ excellencies and perfections and by which their noble works have been so often repeated and as it were renewed is so so far froin deserving contempt that it ought to be encouraged as thing highly useful and worthy of esteem or of painting draperies in order to understand the nature and different degrees of colours or teints used in painting draparies first determine how many di- visions are absolutely necessary to make the first lay of colours and after that the reflects and finishing teints the right method of painting draperies or sattins in general is to make out the whole or what call the first lay with three colours only viz the lights middle teint and shade-teint for the lights mean the colour of all the high lights the middle teint should be very near to the general hue of the sattin and of an exact middle degree between the high lights and the shade- teint the shade-teint would have dark enough for the general hue of all the shadows for which reason call it the shade-teint we should observe that the lights should rather incline to warmissi hue and the middle teint should be made of friendly working colours such as will always mik of clean tender coldish hue the shade-teint should be made of the same colours as the middle teint only with less light therefore this teint will also mix of tender clean colour it is with these three colours we should make out the whole like mezzotinto and we should understand that all the beauty and character of the folds the shape attitude and principal lights and shades are all to be con- fidered and made with these three colours only which should be done to our satisfaction before we add any of the reflects or finishing teints the reffects of drapery and sattins are generally productions of their own and are always lighter than the shadows on which-they are found and being produced by light will consequently have light warm colour mixed with the local colour that receives them here it will be necessary to draperies to observe the general method and secret in managing the colours of the first lay and those of the reflects and sinishing teints in the first lay the high lights should be laid with plenty of stiff colour and then shap ’ and soften ’ into character with the middle teint very correctly where the gradations of the lights are slow as in the large parts it will be proper to lay the middle teint first at their extre- mities with tool that will drive the colour and leave it sparingly be- cause the lights will mix and lie the better upon it next is to make out all the parts of the shadows with the shade-teint drove bare after this comes the middle teint which fills up and serves as the second lights and gradations and should be managed together very nicely to character without touching any of the high lights which finisn the first lay the reflects and finishing teints are in general the antipathies of the first lay they will without great care poison and dirty the colours on which they are laid and therefore should be laid with delicate light touch without softening if it is over-done we must remember to recover it with the colour of the part on which it was laid this may be done directly or when it is dry we should also observe whether the reflects proceed from the same colour or any other that the method of using them is the same before proceed to the particular colours it will be proper to make some observations on their grounds it often hapens that the colour of the cloth is very improper for the ground of the drapery and when it is so we should change it with those colours which we think are most proper to improve and support the finishing colours this method of dead-colouring must consequently preserve them in their greatest lustre in dead-colouring we should lay the lights and shades in manner so as only to shew faint idea of them with regard to the shape and roundings of the figure if we have design to work from then it will be proper to make all the large and principal parts in their places which should always be done with colour that is clean and lighter than the intended drapery tho in gene- ral of tlie same hue and let the shadows be no darker than middle teint white sattin draperies teint these should be mixd and broke in tender manner and then soften ’ with large tool so that nothing rough or uneven be left to isiterrupt or hurt the character of the finishing colours white sattin all whites should be painted on white grounds laid with good body of colour by reason this colour sinks more into the ground than any other there are four degrees of colours in the first lay to white sattin the first is the fine white for the lights the second is the first teint which is made of fine white and very little lvory-black mixed to an exact middle degree between the white and middle teint this co- lour follows the white and it is with this we should shape the lights into character before we lay on any other and take care that this first teint appear distinctly between the white and the middle teint other- wise the beauty and character of the sattin will be spoiled the middle teint should be made of white black and little indian red these three colours are very friendly and mix to beautiful clear colour of pearly hue which has the true brightness and warmth of the general hue of the sattin remember to allow for the red hue changing à little to the lead if there is occasion to mnake any part in the middle teint lighter we should do it with the first teint only this colour should also be laid sparingly before the white in all the little lights that happen in the middle teints and shadows on which we should lay the white with one light touch and be sure not to cover all the part that was made with the first teint lf we do it will spoil the character and look like spot for want of the softening edge or bor- der which must be between the white and the middle teint the shade-teint should be made of tlie same colour as the middle teint but with less white so that it be dark enough for the shadows in gene- ral with which we should make out all the parts of the shadows nicely to character which is the work of the first lay next come the reflects and finishing teints brown oker mixet with the colour of the lights is the most useful colour in general for all reflects in draperies that are produced from their own colours all accidental reflexes are made with the colour of the parts from which they are produced and the local colours that receive them there are but two reflecting teints wanted for draperies in general mean to any one particular colour one should be lighter than the middle teint the other darker these colours may be little changed on the pallet with the first and middle teints as occasion requires or lightly broken on the part that receives them but this last method is not so safe as the other the teint sufficient for blending the dark shadows to the mellow tender hue is made with the shade-teint and little brown oker which should be laid on very sparingly with soft light touches for fear of making them dull and heavy if it should be over-done we may recover it with the colour it was laid upon we often see little blue used in the first teint of white sattin van haecken who was the best drapery-painter we ever had in england did so and sometimes instead of the blue he used blue-black till he found it to be pernicious colour and was therefore obliged to use blue be- cause his middle teint which was made only of black and white was so very cold that no other colour but blue would make colder teint yet he managed these cold colours in all the lights and middle teints so agreeably and so light and easy was his touch that we can not help admiring and may learn something from him tho he was not so lucky in his shadows which were generally of heavy dirty hue this was owing to the colours he used and the method of using them which will always have such an effect when warm or dirty colour is mixed with clean light one for being mixed together they will form dirty colour that muit consequently appear so in the work but if his lead or shade-teint had been mixed with indian red instead of the oker and then followed with few light blending touches of the oker-teint it would have left them clean and mellow it is the want of the red hue which makes the white sattins appear so often like pewter blue sattin blue sattin is made of prussian blue and fine white the best ground for blue is white for the lights and black and white for the shadows the first lay of colours for blue is divided into three degrees or teints we should first make the middle teint of beautiful azure then mix the colour for the lights about middle degree between that and white make the shade-teint dark enough for the shadows in gene- ral all the broad lights should be laid with plenty of colour and shap ’ to character with themiddle teint before we lay on any other colours remember the lefs the colours are mixed the better they will appear and stand for the lights of blue should be managed with as much care as those of white sattin next is to follow with the rest of the middle teint and then make out all the shadows the more we drive the shade-teint the better it will receive the reflects and finishing teints the shadows should be strengthened and blended with lvory-black and some of their own colour which will mix with them into tender mellow hue the reflects are iade as those of white sattin that is with oker and some of the lights which should be perfectly done as we intend it at once painting the shadows when dry may be little improved if there is occasion to alter them with the colours they were made with the prussian proper to be used is that which looks of the most beautiful azure before it is ground and the sooner it is used after it is ground the better it will work and appear velvet may be painted at once the method is to make out the first lay with the middle teint and shade-teint on which we should lay the high lights with light touches and finisn the shadows as we did those of the sattin but the nearest imitation of velvet we can make is dène by glazing which is to prepare ground or dead-colouring with with such colours as will when dry bear out and support the glazing colour in its highest perfection the nature of the glazing colour is to be of fine transparent quality and used simply with oil only so that whatever ground it is laid on the whole may appear distinctly thro ’ it the best ground for blue is made with white and lvory-black the white is for the high lights wliich with the middle teint and shade-teint makes out the first lay like mezzotinto remember to make the middle teint lighter in proportion to the glazing because that will make it the darker it is often necessary to cover all but the high lights with thin glazing do not mean with plenty of oil in the colour but laid with less quantity than if it was to be done once only if any of it touch the lights we should wipe it off with clean rag the very high lights should be improved and made of fine white and left to dry the glazing colour is prussian ground very sine with nut oil and should be laid with large stiffisn tool that will drive the colour as occasion requires it is on the last glazing we should strengthen and finish the shadows the greatest fault in the colouring of drapeties is the painting the chadows with strong glaring colours which destroy the beauty of the lights this is not only the reverse of art but of nature whose beauty always diminishes in proportion with the lights for this rea- son we should take care to blend and soften the shadows with such friendly colours as will agree with their local character and obscurity here we may observe that glazing the middle teint which is made of black and white will not produce colour so blue as if it had been prepared with prussian and white yet this colour will preserve the beauty of the lights in the highest perfection by reason of its tender obsoure hue when the blueness of the other would only diminish them this method of glazing the blue is tlie general rule for all glazing when we are glazing blue the lights may be glazed with uitra- marine tho all the other parts are done with prussian this methed saves great quantity of that valuable colour and answers our purpose as well as if it had all been done with uitramarine though this general method of painting sattins is to make the first lay of cslours with three degrees or teints yet we should understand in using them that they produce two more for the mixing of two dif- ferent colours together on ge cloth will make another of middle teint between them so it is with the lights and middle teint and with the middle and shade-teint the first answers to the first teint in white sattin and the last will consequently be sort of gradating or half-shade if the lights and middle teint mix to beautiful clean colour of middle hue between both there will be no occasion for colour to go between them as in the blue sattin but if in mixing they produce teint inclining to dirty warm huc then there must be another found of sympathizing nature which should be laid between them in order to preserve the beauty of the lights as the first teint in the white sattin for if it was not so the red in the middle teint would certainly dirty and spoil the white it is highly necessary to understand these principles of the first lay of colours in order to have perfect knowlege of the general rule of co- louring on which the principles of colouring depend scarlet and crimson light yellow-red made of light oker light-red and white is the proper ground for scarlet the shadows are indian red and in the darkest parts mixed with very little black the second painting should be little lighter than we intend the finish- ing colour mean in proportion to the glazing which will make it darker the high lights are vermillion and white for sattin and velvet and vermillion for cloth the middie teint is vermillion with very little lake or indian red the shade-teint is made with indian red and lake with the addition of little black in the darkest shadows the difference between scarlet and crimson is that the highlights of crimson are whiter and the middle teint is made darker their reslects are made with light light-red and vermillion the high lights should be laid and managed in the same manner as those of the blue for fear of dirtying them and sometimes they require to be touched over the second time before we glaze them the more the colours of the second painting are drove the easier and better they may be managed to character but the high lights should have good body of colour and be left with delicate light touch after it is well dry we should finisn with glazing the whole with sine lake and improve the reflects and shadows remember that the scarlet requires but very thin glazing and it is better to glaze the crimson twice over then lay too much at once painting pink-colour there are two different methods of painting pink-colour one is by glazing the other is done with body of colours at one painting the sane grounds do for both which should be whitish colour inclining to yellow for the lights and indian red lake and white for the shadows the second painting for the glazing method is done with the same colours and little vermillion for the reflects and vermillion and white for the high lights when it is dry we should glaze it with fine lake and then break and soften the shadows into character and har- mony directly the other method is to make the high lights with carmine and white the middle teint with lake white and little carmine and the shadows with lake and indian red with little vermillion for the reflects but remember the shadows will require to be broken with some tender obscure teint yellow the ground for yellow should be yellowish white for the lights and mixture of the okers for the shadows there are the fame number of teints in the yellow as there are in the white sattin the method of using them is the very same the lights are made with king ’ yellow ground with clean goed drying oil the first teint is light oker changed with little of the pearl teint made with the dark shade and white which should be laid and managed as the first teint in white sattin the middle teint is mixture of the light and brown oker softened with the pearl teint the shade-teint is made with brown pink and brown oker these belong to the first lay the reflects are light oker and sometimes in the warmest parts mixed with little light-red the shadows are strengthened with brown pink and burnt uinber these colours well managed will produce yellow very like van dyck ’ but if we leave out the king ’ yellow which is the high lights only then it will be one of lely favourite yellows green the proper ground for green is light-yellow green which is made of light oker little white and prussian for the lights and the okers brown pink and prussian for the shadows the finest green we have for drapery is made of king ’ yellow prussian and brown pink the high lights are king ’ yellow and very little prussian the middle teint has more prussian and the shade- teint is made with some of the middle teint brown pink and more prussian but the darkest shadows are brown pink and little prussian the lights and middle teint should be managed in the same manner as those of the blues the shade-teint should be kept intirely from the lights because the brown pink that is in it will in mixing dirty them as the black does those of the blues remember to allow for their drying à little darker and that the king ’ yellow should be ground with good drying oil for the longer it is dwying the more it will change and grow darker and the sooner it is used the better it will stand it is proper to have two sorts of king ’ yellow mean one to be very light which will do best for the high lights of velvet changeable colours are made with four principal teints viz the high lights middle teint shade-teint and reflecting teint the greatest art lies in finding the exact colour of the middle teint because it has more of the general hue of the silk than any of the others the shade-teint is of the same hue with the middle teint though it is dark enough for the shadows the high lights though often very dif- ferent from the middle teint should be of clean friendly working colour that will in mixing with it produce teint of clean sympa- thizing hue the method of painting silks is to make out the folds with the shade teint and then fill them up in the lights with the middle teint this is what call the first lay which should be done to our satisfaction before we add any other colours and the stiffer the middle teint is used the better the high lights may be laid upon it the reflecting teint falls ge- nerally upon the gradating half-shades and should be laid with tender touches sparingly for fear of spoiling the first lay this method of painting answers to all the colcured silks as well as changeable with this differeuce only that the plain colours require not so much art in matching the teints as the changeable do the last part of the work is the finishing and strengthening the shadows with an obscure teint little inclining to mellowish hue such as will not catch the eye and interrupt the beauty of the lights black the best ground for black is light-red for the lights and indian red and little black for the shadows the finishing colours are for the lights black white and little lake the middle teint has less white and more lake and black the shade-teint is made of an equal quantity of lake and brown pink with very little black the method of painting black is very different from that of other colours for as the principal thing in them is to leave their lights clean and brilliant so in black it is to keep the shadows clear and transparent therefore we should begin with the shade-teint and glaze over all the shadows with it next lay in the darkest shadows with black and little of the shade-teint very correctly after that fill up the whole breadth of lights with the middle teint only all which should be done exactly to the character of the sattin and then finisn with the high lights here we may observe the ground being red will bear out and sup- port the reds which are used in the finishing colours the lake in the lights takes off the cold hue and gives it à more beautiful colour if the shade-teint was of any other colour than transparent warm hue the shadows would consequently be black and heavy because no other colours can preserve the warm brilliancy which is wanting in the shadows of the black like lake and brown pink black is of cold heavy nature and always too strong for any other colour therefore we should make an allowance in using it there will be few reflects in sattin which should be added as those of other colours but they should be made of strong colours such as burnt umber or brown oker mixt with little of the shade-teint though the grounds which have mentioned for the draperies are absolutely necessary for the principal and nearest figures in picture such as single portrait or the like yet do not intend them so for figures which are placed more into the picture such as are behind the principal or front figures their grounds should always be fainter in proportion to their local finishing colours linen the colours used in linen are the same as those in white sattin except the first teint which is made of white and ultramarine ashes instead of the black and mixt to very light blueish teint in in the dead-colouring we should take particular care that the grounds be laid very white and broad in the lights the shadows are made with black white and little indian red like the middle teint of white sattin these should be left very light and clean in order to sup- port the finishing colours the second painting begins with glazing all the lights with stiff pen- cil and fine white only drove bare without using any oil the shadows may be scumbled with poppy oil and some of the colour they were made of this is the first lay on which we are to follow with the finishing colours directly the middle teint of white sattin is the best colour for the general hue of the shadows with this and white in different degrees we should make out all the parts to character with free light touches without softening then with large long-pointed pencil and fine white lay the high lights very nicely with one stroke after this comes the fine light blueish teint which should be mixed-light and laid in the tender gradations very sparingly and lightly without silling them up remember the first lay should be left clear and distinct the more it appears the better it is the overmixing and joining all the colours toge- ther which spoils the beauty of the character therefore it is better to let it dry before we add the reflects and finishing teints the method of letting the beautiful clear colours dry before we add the warm reflex and harmonizing teints prevents them from mixing and dirtying each other the principal blending colours used in the reflects are the yellow teint green teint and the rose teint which last is made of lake indian red and white find glazing the pearl and lead colours with white though it seems to answer our purpose when it is done will cer- tainly sink and be lost in the grounds on which it is laid therefore we should make the dead-colouring as white as we intend the finishing colours by reason they will sink little in proportion to the colour of the cloth which the glazing with pure white only will recover landschapes the principal colours used in landschapes are fine white common white fine light oker brown oker brown pink burnt umber lvory black prussian blue uitramarine terra-vert ii lake indian red vermillion king ’ yellow the principal teints used in landschapes are light oker and white light oker prussian and white light oker and prussian the same darker terra-vert and prussian brown pink and prussian brown pink and brown oker brown pink oker and prussian indian red and white lvory black indian red and lake the colours necessary for dead-colouring are common white light oker brown oker burnt umber indian red lvory black and prussian the principal colours and teints for painting the sky are fine white uitramarine prussian light oker vermillion lake and indian red the teints are fine azure lighter azure light oker and white vermillion and white and teint made of white little vermillion and some of the light azure landschapes should be painted on fort of tanned leather colour which is made of brown oker white and light-red this colour gives warmth to the shadow colours and is very agreeable and proper for glazing sketching or rubbing in the design is the first work of the picture this should be done with burnt umber drove with drying oil and little oil of turpentine in faint slight scumbling free manner as we shade with indian ink and water leaving the colour of the cloth for the lights as we do that of the paper remember in doing it we leave no part of the shadows so dark as we intend the first lay or dead- colouring which is to be lighter than the finishing colours and though the foliage of the trees is only rubbed in with faint sort of scumbling yet the trunks and bodies should be in their proper shapes with their breadths of light and shadow all kinds of buildings should be done in the same manner leaving the colour of the cloth for their lights the figures on the fore-ground if they are determined should also be sketched in the same method and then left to dry of dead-colouring let the firft lay or dead-colouring be without any bright glaring or strong dark colours so that the effect is made more to receive and pre- serve the finishing colours than to shew them in the first painting the sky should be done first then all the distances and so work downwards to the middle group and from that to the fore-ground and nearest nearest parts remember all the parts of each group as trees buildings or the like be all painted with the group they belong to the greatest secret in dead-colouring is to find the two colours which serve for the ground of the shadows in general the sky excepted and the method of ufing them with the lights the first of which is the dark-shade with little lake in it the other colour is only burnt um- ber these should be little changed to the natural hue of the objects and then laid and drove with drying oil in the same manner as we shade with indian ink which is scumbling kind of glazing and as such they should be left for otherwise they will be dark and heavy and there- fore would be intirely spoiled for the finishing glazing both these colours mix and sympathize agreeably with all the lights but should be laid before them when the landschape is designed begin with the sky wnich should be laid with good body of colours and left with faint resemblance of the principal clouds and this we fhould do more in the manner of claro obscuro than with finishing colours the whiter it is left the better it will bear out and support them the distances should be made out faint and obscurely with the dark-shade and some of their lights in different degrees and laid so as best to find and shew their principal parts as we come more into the middle group we fall by degrees into the burnt umber in the shades all the grourds of the trees should be laid or rubbed in enough only to leave an idea of their shapes and shadows faintly the ground of their shadows must be clean and lighter than their finishing colours such as will support their character and seem easy to finish on in painting the lights it is better to incline more to the middle teint than to the very high lights and observe to leave them with sufficient body of clean colours which will receive and preserve the finishing colours the better all which may be done with few teints after this go over the whole with the sweetener very lightly which will soften and mix the colours agreeably for finishing second painting begin with the sky and lay in all the azure and colours of the hori- zon then soften them after that lay in the general teint of the clouds and finisn on it with the high lights and the other teints that are want- ing with light tender touches then suften the whole with the sweetener very lightly remember the finishing of the sky should be done all at once painting because the tender character of the clouds will not do so well as when the whole is wet observe that the stiffer the azure and colours of the horizon are laid the better the clouds may be painted upon them the greatest distances are chiessy made with the colour of the sky and as they grow nearer and darker we should glaze and scumble the parts very thin with such glazing shadow-colours as come nearest to the general hue of the group the objects are in this glazing should be understood of darkish hue and that the first painting or dead-colour should be seen through it distinctly on this lay or ground we should add the finishing colours now supposing this glazed ground is properly adapted to the object and place think then it will be easy to find the other colours which are wanted for the lights and finissiings of the same but in laying thein we must take great care that we do not spoil the glazing therefore we should be very exact in making those colours on the pallet and then be sure to lay them with light free touches before proceed any farther it will be proper to say something of the most useful glazing colours lake terra-vert prussian and brown pink are the four principal the more we manage them like indian ink and the more distinctly we leave them the better their transparent beauty will stand and appear pro- vided we do it with good drying oil after these four glazing colours burnt umber is very good glazing warm brown and of great use in the broken grounds and nearest parts but the most agreeable colour for the the darkest shadows is the dark shade improved with lake it is fine warm shade when it is drove with drying oil no colour in the world is so sweet and sympathizing it mixes harmonioussy with all the lights as well as the shadows and is charming colour in the trunks and bodies of trees and in all kind of buildings we should make out all the ground of the objects with such glazing shadow-colours as seem nearest to the natural hue of the object in that situation but as the principal glazing colours themselves are often too strong and glaring they should therefore be little changed and softened with such colours as are of near resemblance to themselves and the objects thus ifit is in the distances the terra-vert and azure which are their principal glazing colours may be improved and made lighter with some of the sky teints and as the distances come nearer with the purple as we get more into the middle group the terra- vert and prussian may be changed with some of the green teiats such as are made without white for white is the destruction of all glazing colours as we approach the first group there is less occasion for change- ing them but the fore-ground and its objects require all the strength and force of glazing which the colours are capable of producing after this glazing ground we should follow with strengthening the same in the shadows and darkest places in such manner as will seem easy to finish which is the first lay of the second painting the colours that come next for finishing are in the degree of middie teints these should be carefully laid over the greatest breadth of lights in such manner as not to spoil and cover too much of the glazing do it with good body of the colour as stiff as the pencil can agreeably manage to character remember the colours of the middle teint should be of clean beautiful hue according to these methods think it will be easy to finisn all the second painting as we work down from the skys through the middle group as we come to the first group where all the objects should appear perfectly finisned we should finish their under or most distant parts before we paint any of the other which appear nearer observe this method dovn to the last and nearest objects of the picture and where it so happens that painting one tree over another does not please forbear the second until the first is dry thin near trees of different colours will do better if we let the under parts dry before we add the finishing colours the third and last painting- if oiling is necessary lay the least quantity that can be which should be done with stump-tool or pencil proportioned to the place that is to be oiled so that we may oil no more than is wanted then wipe the whole place that is oiled with peice of silk handkerchief by this method we leave no more oil than is proper for our purpose when we are going to finisn any objects we should remember to use great variety of teints very near of the same colour but most of all when we are finishing trees this gives richnefs to the colouring and produces harmony find by experience the greens will fade and grow darker therefore it is highly necessary to improve and force them by exaggerating the lights and making an allowance in using them so much the lighter for the same reason we should take great care that we ldo not overcharge and spoil the beauty of the glazing for if we do it will be dull and heavy and therefore will consequently grow darker the method for painting near trees is to make the first lay very near to nature though not quite so dark but more in the degree of middle teint and follow it with strengthening the shadows then the middle teints and last of all lay the high lights and finishing colours but all this can not be done as it should be at once painting therefore the best way is to do no more than the first lay with the faint shadows and leave it to dry then begin with improving the middle teints and shadows and let them dry the third and last workis adding all the lights and finishing colours in the best manner we are able this method of leaving the first and second part to dry separately not only makes the whole much easier and more agreeable but leaves the colours in the greatest perfection because most of the work may be done with scumbling and glazing and some parts without oiling the lights also may be laid with better body of colour which will not be mixed and spoiied with the wvet ground what have said of trees answers the same to all kinds of shrubs and bushes the figures in landschape are the last work of the picture those in the fore-ground should be done first and those in the distances next for after the figures in the first and farthest group are painted think it will be much easier to find the proportions of those in the middle parts of the picture and we should observe that the shadows of the figures should be of the same hue or colour with those of the group or place they are in introduction we are much obliged to the learned in the mathematicks who in the beginning of this century made such great im- provements in the principles of perspective and who have done their utmost to render them useful but for want of understanding the art of painting and the practice of design- ing they are intelligible only to those readers who have sufficient fund of geometry to comprehend all their schemes and examples they found that all planes were alike in geometry and followed their geo- metrical genius which led them into such constructions as they thought would explain their properties in general and as they said give new turn to perspective indeed their schemes are so intricate that none but those who are well acquainted with the mathematicks can under- stand them dr. taylor neglected the horizontal plane and in his book made no difference between that plane and any other whatsoever here it is that am quite of the reverse opinion to that learned gentle- man and believe that the term-of horizontal line should confine our notions to the horizontal plane and think that that plane which represents the earth on which we live enjoys some particular privileges which makes the figures in it more easy and more convenient to be described notwithstanding all planes are alike in geometry for which reason perspective reason have followed nature and have united the old and new prin- ciples and believing that objects are best understood fivin their natural appearance have given the horizontal plane to all my woik with the vanishing line in its proper position here found it absolutely necessary to confider the subject in manner as yet unattempted and which should require no mathematical knowlege to understand it teis obliged me to find one general method for the whole work and find- ing the principles few and simple upon which the art depends and that there are no more than three planes and six different lines required to- be understood in order to represent any ohject whatsoever composed such variety of objects as conceived would draw on the knowiege of perspective and which think can not fail of rendering the useful principles of this art general and intelligible most gentlemen that have studied the mathematicks whom have talked with on perspective are for having mathematical demonstration of all the lineal parts of picture and will not allow that any thing can be right but what is done according to the strictest rules and dr. taylor says painter ought to govern himself intirely by the rules of perspective and not to take any liberties whatsoever confess am of their opinion and believe they are most certainly right provided the picture was only the projection of any of the five solids were we to follow the rules in projecting the base and capital of column we should find those useless operations too tedious and difficult for human patiencé and how we are to represent all sorts of objects according to the rules of perspective is to me as surprising as impossible painter is not to be confined strictly to the rules of perspective but to make them subservient to his purposes nothing should tie up his hands he should not have his genius imprisoned but be at liberty to express his idea like gyofto with one stroke of his pencil and as fresnoy says let the compasses be ratber in his eyes than bis hands thete let him measure distinctly every object by comparison which is the principal talent of painter if he is well acquainted with the prin- ciples of his art he will not stop at the dry rules of geometry wlailst his fancy is sketching all the principal parts of the ’ icture ile will preceed with the whole and then after the design is fixed correct such parts as are requisite with the rules of perspective design not to trouble the reader with multitude of examples but to explain the general rules of perspective in such manner as may be intelligible to him all my schemes are limited to six plates only which are the suliject of the six different sorts of lines that represent all objects whatsoever and which are adapted to such objects as are easy to be anderstood and though design to take the reader out of the common road will not lead hiin any round-about tedious bye-ways as is often the case shall conduct him directly into some beautiful garden where he may entertain himself with pleasing variety of objects as buildings aventies walks and visto ’ terminated with agreeable views of distant prospects and that he may enjoy them to his wish have intermixed no figures that might interrupt or divide his attention plate figure order to explain the general rules of perspective let us suppose twe see the real objects as part of garden with some distant prospects and between them and the spectator ’ eye let us imagine transparent plane as glass to be placed perpendicularly on the ground at the nearest part of the objects on or thro ’ which plane we see their representations and it is with the assistance of this imaginary plane that we are to understand the principles and are supposed to produee the perspective projection or representation the seat or line on which this plane stands is called the base-line as zy the line hi at the horizon is called the horizontal line the height or distance this line is from the base-line is always equal to the height of the eye of the spectator and is always drawn parallel to the base-line the the distance which we are from the imaginary plane when at the station where we propose to take the perspective view is the distance of the picture the point of sight is the principal point in picture it is that point where line from the spectator ’ eye cuts the imaginary plane at right angles and which always distinguisn with the letter the line so is equal to the distance of the picture and cuts the horizontal line at right angles as the principal ray does the imaginary plane therefore is the eye-point because it represents the eye transferred from its first position or point of view to the imaginary plane the next thing we are to consider is the ground-plane the ground-plane is that part which is below the base-line zy lt is the plane whereon the plans of the geometrical or original objects are drawn though we are obliged to have the ground-plane below the base- line yet the parts which are in it will be produced by the rules above it and as it were beyond it at distance in perspective proportion as those in the ground-plane are distant from the base-line we should remember that in order to represent any objects in per- spective it is necessary that we understand their geometrical plan eleva- tion profile and section before we attempt the perspective projection in the beginning of the work we should first draw the base-line then asfume point for the point of sight and draw the horizontal line through it make so equal to the distance of the picture and design the geo- metrical plan of the object in the ground-plane here the geometrical or original object is the point the repre- sentation of which is required to be found in the imaginary plane or picture first draw line from the given point to cut the base-line in any direction at pleafure as ab parallel to that draw line from the eye- point to cut the horizontal line which gives the vanishing point for the representation of the line ab here the line os is parallel to the line ab therefore will be the vanishing point draw the lines bs and ao the intersection of which is the representation sought the linc ba is also the representation of its original ba we may find the representation of the seat or place where the pine- tree grows without using the original in the ground-plane thus bring down the distance to the horizontal line as sd and bring up ba to the base-line as bc which makes bc and sd parallel then line drawn from cto will cut the line bs in therefore if we suppose the imaginary plane to be the picture and having assumed the line bs in which we suppose the pine-tree make bc on the bottom of the picture equal to the distance we suppose or know the tree is beyond the imaginary plane which distance is commonly called the required distance then the line cd will intersect bs which gives the representation sought is the vanisning point of the original line ab because the line ab vanissies in that poift the representation depends on the parallelism of the lines os and ab for were they parallel in any other direction they would then project the point in the very same place nowv after this explanation of the first figure we should remember that the imaginary plane is to be understood and called the picture fi let be five original points given in the ground- planc to find their representations zy is the base-lipe dv the horizontal line the point of sight and the distance of the picture instead of drawing the lines from the points in any direction we may draw two parallel lines thro four of the points to the base-line as cg and df which will shorten the work then draw their parallel ov from the eye-point to cut the horizontal line which will give the vanishiing point drawgv and ƒv and intersect them with the rays co and do which give the representations the points and are in line that is parallel to the base-line the representation of which must be parallel to the base-line also which being intersected by the ray eo gives the point then will the points be the representation of the original points the projection sought we may find their representation without using the ground-plane thus bring down the distance of the vanishing point to the hori- zontal line as and bring up the lines côg and daf to the basc- line then draw lines from them to the point which will intersect the lines gv and ƒv in the same points as may be seen by the line vh all circles and curve-lined figures are represented by finding several points in them and then joining them neatly by hand therefore we should assume in the original lines only so many points as are absolutely necessary and in such manner as may be easy for the work of the pro- jection fig is the method of dividing the visual line es into any number of parts as the trees let zy be the base-line the point of sight so the distance of the picture and sd that distance brought to the horizontal line and let the line es be required to be divided into given number of parts equal to fe first bring up the given space fe to the base-line as ie and draw the line which intersects es in the point or the seat of the first tree instead of continuing the divisions on the base-line we may draw aline from the first division to the point of sight and by making the line parallel to e we have new scale of the space at its place in the picture therefore all the rest are found by this repetition plate ii fig lines that interfect or cut the picture at right angles are called direct lines which lines will vanish in the point of sight therefore we see rows of trees or the like which are in parallel lines contract themselves and seem to grow more and more narrow the far- ther they are extended froin the eye the representations of direct lines are called visual lines or rays here the lines ab and ƒg are direct lines whose representations are the visuals bs and which vanish in the point of sight as do also both the green walls the walk and the sides of the buildings that are parallel to them the side of the building at has its parts as the base and frize parallel to the base-line but those in the side where the windows are and which are perpendicular to the first vanish in the point of sight the same holds with respect to the pavilion fig zy is the base-line the point of sight de the horizon- tal line and so the distance of the picture are directlines the representations of which vanisn in the point of sight in order to understand the nature of the generating lines and angles and the distance of the picture being placed above the horizontal line suppose they were turned or lifted upon their axis the vanishing line de till the eye-point is directly opposite to the point of sight then they would be in visual plane which passes from the spectator ’ eye parallel to the ground-plane the intersection of which plane with the imaginary plane or picture is the vanishing line of that plane or hori- zontal line lines which are dravn from the exe-point to the horizontal line producing the vanishing points are called generating lines they are also the parallels of original lines in the first figure plate os is the parallel of the line ab in the second ov is the parallel of the lines cg and df in the third the principal ray is the parallel of the line fe and in the fourth figure plate il it is the same to the lines ab and fg the generating line oe being parallel to the diagonal el gives the vanishing point of that line and dis the vanishing point of the other diagonal dk the line op is also the parallel of the original line le therefore pis the vanishing point of that line the lines that generate the vanishing points of two original lines make the same angle at the spectator ’ eye or eye point as the original lines do with each other here the generating angle soe is equal to that of dle and produces that of sle and the angle dos is equal to that of dke and pro- duces that of dks the angle pos is also equal to that of elf and pro¬ duces the angle pis lf we consider the plane of the picture as ceiling these objects which are laid on the ground will then appear perpendicular to the plane of the ceiling this fort of perspective is easy because the representation of objects which are parallel to the plane of the ceiling are similar to their originals and therefore will retain their geometrical forms plate iii ll representations of objects parallel to the picture are parallel to its original therefore those lines that are parallel to the picture have no vanissiing points because the original lines which should produce the parallel are also parallel to the picture lines that are parallel to the picture are called transverse lines fig zy is the base-line hl the horizontal line the point of sight and sd the distance of the picture in the horizontal line which is point just behind the tree in this picture all the objects but the approaching walk and the green wall are parallel to the picture here have given the plans of the four trees and the grafs-plot and bz the distance the wall is from the picture which distance is found by the intersection of line from to the point and the visual zs as in the base-line of the wall make n equal to nm and draw the vifual ns intersect that with the line d which will give the corner of the grass-plot c is the distance the trees are from the picture the intersection of the line sd and the visual will give the representation of the seat of the tree whose plan is through which point draw line parallel to the rcaae in which te line will be the seat of four trees and the end of the green wall the rest of this figure needs no explication fi my is the base-line is the point of sight sd the hori- zontal line and distance of the picture planes that are perpendicular to the horizontal plane are called vertical planes therefore the imaginary plane or picture is vertical plane whose intersection with the ground plane is the base-line the objects whose sides are mnrd are in the plane of the picture and those of and are in plane parallel to the picture the line og is the vanish- ing line of vertical plane which cuts the picture in that direction the distance of any vanishing line which passes through the point of sight is equal to the distance of the picture therefore gs and os are equal to sd in order to project the object draw the visual fs for thg upper side then draw the two diagonals no and fg and the sidehl which will complete the whole square in the plane of the picture is the geome- trical of the end of the beam in in this seventh figure it is obvious after the vanishing lines their centers and distances are fixed that the rules for drawing the appcar- ance of objects upon the vertical or perpendicular planc are the sanie as those for representing them on the horizontal plane which rules will answer the same to inclined planes the line which passes through ol is the vanishiing line of an inelined plane which inclines to the picture in the direction of the line do and ol is the distance of that vanisning line it being the length of do which last is the parallel of the inclined plane more will be said on this subject when we come to the inclined plane plate iv fig is the base-line hi the horizontal line the point of sight and so the principal ray or distance of the picture the two direct lines ca and kl are part of the originals whose visual lines as and ls terminate this agreeable walk my design in this picture is chiefly to shew the representation of line which is perpendicular to the ground plane whose original seat is the pro- jection of which is the intersection of the visual as and the ray co as à the object which have made choice of for the perpendicular line is the fust of the gothic column the axis of which is next to be demonstrated let ab in the plane of the picture be the given height of the per- pendicular line then will the visual bs determine the top and line drawn from the seat perpendicular to the base-line gives the axis of the column the representation sought tle reprefentation is in avisual plane which passes from the line ab through the column the face of the green wall and vanishes in the visual point this visual plane is also vertical plane because it is in à perpendicular direction there is also perpendicular plane which passes through the axes of the yews or cone trees in which are found their heights their seats may be found as fig in the first plate the situation of the buildings is parallel to the picture which may be observed by their parallel parts corresponding with the base-line fig zy is the base-line the point of sight de the hori- zontal line so the distance of the picture go is the vanishing line of the vertical plane and sd is its distance placed perpendicular to it all thefe objects are in perpendicular position to the horizontal plane therefore all their sides are in perpendicular or vertical planes the figure is the representation of cube which has its nearest side in the plane of the picture the perspective of the upper face in the horizontal plane is shewn by the visuals and the diagonals from and in the vanishing line of that plane the projection of the side in the vertical plane is also shewn by the visuals and diagonals g and of here have made the double pro- ection to this cube only to fhew how exactly alike the principles are to both the planes which will appear more if we turn the paper so that the vanishing line go be in the horizontal position then the horizontal scheme will be changed to the vertical and consequently appear so the pillar has that and its opposite side parallel to the plane of the picture but the other sides are in vertical planes which vanisn in the visual point the plan is shewn by the diagonal to it is obvious from this figure that all objects which are parallel to the picture can- not alter nor change their shapes for if we suppose lines continued from all the parts to the vanishing point and that they were cut by plane in vertical and-paralhed direction to the picture yet then every section vould retain the original form of the side the pillar placed obliquely with the base-line has its nearest angle in the plane of the picture the vanishing points are produced by the generating lines which make the rig angle at the eye point as doe the representation of which is dhe and dle the side is in vertical plane that passes through the line lh and vanishes in the point the other side is in the plane hl. and therefore vanishes in the point in order to project the bottoin bring down the distance of the vanishing point to the vanishing line as make hf equal to the side and draw fe which gives the side h draw line from paral- lel to the base-line to intersect hd which gives the other side but if the vanishing points were not at equal distance from the point of sight which is here the vanisning point of the diagonal then it would be necessary to draw lines from to and from through which would give the other side the triangular pillar has its nearest angle in the plane of the picture and its plan in the ground plane the projection of which is found by bringing the sides to the base-line as and draw which gives the side mthe visual line is the distance of brought dovn to the horizontal line draw which gives the other side then raise the sides and finifh the top the side is in vertical and visual plane the side vanifhies in the point the nearest parts of objects will in their representations be farthest from the vanishing line of the horizontal plane and if that vanishing line was in the middle their tops and bottoms would then be exactly similar as may be understood by these ohjects imagine from the principles which have already laid down the reader will be inclined to believe that the representation of objects may be projected without the ground plane for if we understand the original why should we not use the same rules at the part of the object in the picture where the projection is required as if it was below the bottom of the picture which method would certainly shorten the work and make it more easy plate fig ie tlie base line pi the horizontal line the point of sight so the distance of the picture and ab part of an original oblique line all tlie objects in this picture are represented to the eye obliquely not one visual line is to be found in the work except the principal ray the vanishing points vary in their distances from the point of sight the situation of the wall is governed by the original line ab the paral- lel of which is ov and po is perpendicular to it this makes the generating angle pov degrees which determines the end of the wall to be square in order to find the perspective of the wall we should first find the representation of the plan from which we raise the elevations the whole being governed by two vanishing points with their distances brought to the vanishing line makes it very easy the seat of the trees is sound as that in figure plate by making their distance or space from the firsttree parallel to the base-line and dividing the line ap as es in that figure but reinember it shouldbe with the distance of the vanishing point the obelisk at being placed with the walks has their vanishing points the corner of the building at is square though it appears an obtuse angle which is owing to the little distance of the picture for had the point pbeen at much greater distance the obliquity of the line pz would appear more to the satisfaction of the eye fig here az is the base-line pv the horizontal line the point of sight and so the distance of the picture design to begin with the projection of the wall and after that of the floor then the object rt and so finisn with the moulding above the wall the generating angle pov is right angle therefore those of the wall will be square we should first make the corner cl then the side and next that of assume the corner xy and draw lines from it to to intersect those of cv and iv which will give the side and make the side which finishes the wall the line oh divides the angle pov equally and ch is its repre- sentation is the vanishing point of lines that intersect the wall as diagonals do the side of square let ac be the diagonal of the first square draw av and ap intersect them with pe and ve which give the square abcd the next diagonal is be by this repitition it is eafy to see how the whole floor is projected design the corner of the object rt to be exactly over the point and that its side opposite to should touch the wall let ae in the plane of the picture be the given height of the corner therefore that corner is the intersection of ev and perpendicular from the side next the wall and its opposite are in vertical plane the vanishing line of which is vh because it passes through the point in that direction and is the vanishing point of the common intersection of the vertical and horizontal planes is the distance of the vanishing point brought down to the horizontal line the place where we should make the original angle of inclination as veh which is the angle the object is supposed to make with the floor and is the vanishing point of the inclination lf from the point we draw line perpendicular to he to cut the vanishing line hv then will that point be the vanishing point of lines perpendicular to the side the perpendicular at gives the length of draw all the sides to their vanishing points which finish the repre- fentation the mosl exact and casiest method of projecting mouldings in archi- tecture is to make the geometrical profile at its place in the picture which design to stiew by the projection of these three mouldings that represent fort of cornice let ikl be the geometrical profile of the mouldings placed at the top of the wall to the line cl draw line from the vanishing point of the diagonal through cut that with line from through the intersection of which is the extremity of the projection by repeating this method at every point of the profile down to the bottom we shall have the exact representation in vertical plane which passes through the angle or mitre joint when this projection of the mitre joint is found we hane nothing more to do but to continue the lines of the sides in their proper direction plate vi this picture is the representation of large block of stone whose angles are square like those cube it stands on one of its edges on the horizontal plane and is supported by another block the line cp is the seat of the edge it stands on and cv is the seat of the side its angle of inclination with the horizontal plane is equal to the angle veh therefore is the vanishing point of its inclination fi let zy be the base-line pe the horizontal line the point of sight s the distance of the picture and the vanishing point of the edge the block stands on first we must find the vanishing point of lines that are perpendi- cular to the point thus draw line from to the eye-point and and make ov perpendicular to the line op which gives the vanishing point then will be the vanishing point of the seat of the side which side is in vertical plane whose vanishing line passes thro in that direction therefore is the vanishing point of the ccinnion inter- section of the vertical and horizontal planes draw the vanishing line gh then will be its center and vo its distance make ve per- pendicular to the vanishing line gh and equal to its distance vo then at the point make the geometrical angle of inclination as veh which gives the vanishing point of the inclination draw eg per- pendicular to eh which makes in that vanishing line the vanishing point of lines perpendicular to next draw the vanishing line ph and make sd parallel to it and equal to the distance of the picture then from the point of sight draw line to cut the vanishing line ph at right angles which gives the center and id the distance of that vanishing line here it is obvious in this projection that the lines ph gh and pg are the three vanishing lines of the several faces of figure which con- tain solid right angle it is also very plain that the line eh according to thefe rules must be the geometrical of the original inclined plane therefore if we make eb equal to the end or thickness of the block then will be the seat of as on the horizontal plane to proceed with the projection make ab in the plane of the picture equal to ab then will the point be the nearest angle of the block next we should make ik equal to id and draw the lines pk and hk that generate square angle which is equally divided by the line ke make bl equal to the length of the block and parallel to the vanishing line ph draw line from to the distance of which will give the side bn draw nh and the diagonal be and thro ’ their intersections draw line from which gives the upper side next draw the line bg which gives bc the nearest edge and draw the lines bp cp and bh ch then the line ng and one from the angle above to will finisn the whole representation or projection of ghe block have endeavoured to shew in the progress of all the schemes chat the principles on which the whole art depends are so simple that it is obvious the method is general to all planes alike first of the horizontal plane the distance of the picture inust be placed from the center or point of sight perpendicular to its vanishing line before we can make the generating angies which give the vanish- ing points then we may bring down their distances to the horizontal line provided the dimensions of the original are brought parallel to them as have shewn in the course of the work secondly of the vertical plane the distance of the vanishing line- is placed perpendicular to it and from the eye-point proceed the gene- rating lines that give the vanishing points the distance of which are used and brought to the vanishing line in the same manner as those of the horizontal plane and the inclined plane has its distance placed perpendicular to the vanisning line and from the eye-point proceed the generating lines and angles which produce the vanishing points and which are also brought to the vanishing line and used as those of the horizontal the method of finding the center of vanishing line is only to draw line from the point of sight to cut or intersect the vanishing line at right angles which intersection will be the center of that vanishing line the general rule for finding the distance of vanishing line is always to make the distance of the picture from the point of sight parallel to that vanishing line and to draw line from that to the center of the vanishing line which will be the distance of that vanishing line as di is to the vanishing line ph or ov to that of gh to find the perspective representation of circles we are obliged to make plan of the circle or part of the plan by adding such lines to it as may easily be projected and leave clear idea of the required circle fro let be the point of sight and the points of distance and klmn the scheme of the plan the most exact and easiest method is to inclose the circle with square and then make the two diameters and diagonals which give the eight required points but instead of drawing lines thro the points of the diagonals parallel to the sides of the square make them parallel to the diagonals this method gives the same points with the lines nearer to the circle than can be drawn by any other method whatsoever the rest of the figure needs no demonstration fi shews the method of making the plan of the circles in order to find the perspective representation of the torus which have done according to my method juft shewn of drawing circles and which may be understood very easily at sight of this figure the perspective of the torus seems to be circle contained in four lines which are nearer or farther distant from each other according to the situation of the eye two of which are perpendicular to the hori- zontal plane these give the greatest breadth of the torus the other twe are parallel to that plane and give the height and depth the one is the upper and farthest part of the circle the other the nearest and bottom part of the torus the two perpendicular lines proceed from the ex- tremity of the circle in the plan which are found from the projection of the two eight opposite parts those that give the height and depth are governed by the perspective section of the base which is in the vertical plane fio is the diagonal scale which is of universal use for tranf- ferring all sorts of defigns to the greatest exactness and so easy to under- stand that one demonstration is sufficient for every artist who will imagine find no manner of difficulty in applying it to practice suppose ab to represent one foot in the design which we are to work from and ac to be the intended length of one foot in that which we are going to make the method is first to take the dimensions of the part we propose to begin with then to place the compasses to the base-line of the scale and find what it is in the line db then open them to that in-the line dc which will be the required length thus the reprefentation is found by feet and inches because the base-line da contains twelve parts which consequently divide the length ab and ac on the lines de and dc into that number by this method we may make the scale to any proportion and as it is the business of every artist to find proper scale for his purpose there -- fore painters are not obliged to use always such-scales as the work was wrought to suppose we draw the pedestal without using the method of feet and inches divide the whole height into any convenient number of equal parts and let one of those be for the scale then divide the height we intend to make the pedestal of in the same manner and apply them to the method of the scale which will answer our purpose as well it is sometimes necessary in copying to divide the original into number of squares and then divide the cloth for the copy the same lf in one of the squares at the corner of the cloth we make the scale according to this method we may use them as we did the scale of feet and inches the number in the base of the scale is at our pleasure remember to make the squares very large for none but novices make them otherwise fi is method which have often found to be of great use and very easy to practise when we are à little used to.it suppose the line aa to be the height of any design we have to work from and the line bb the intended height of that which we are going to make draw the base ce then place the design perpendicular to it as aa bb and draw line from through to cut the base which will give the center if the line aa be divided into any number of parts and we draw lines from the center cthrough them to cut the linebb then will they divide the line bb in the same manner exactly therefore if the line aa was the axis of à column and entablature the same may be transferred to the height we would have it by having small nail in the center and fine thread such as the wig-makers weave with and only strain the same over the parts in aa to bb which will give the required dimensions in the same manner we may have all the breadths by applying them- to the line aa and continuing them to the line bb or if it is only few of them as the diameters they may be done separately but remem- ber that after the places of the lines aa and bbare fixed they must con- tinue so till the whole is finished the antique figure in the sixth plate marked with the letter is an object have studied with great application and care in order to project it exactly according to the rules of perspective and as improved in the knowlege of the new principles flattered myself should succeed believing if iarrived at such perfection in the art ’ should then be able in time to represent all objects whatsoever as some of the learned in the mathematicks will have it according to the strictest rules who dogma- tically asfert that every part of the perspective should be mathematically true when we fancy this to be really the case it is reasonable to believe that we should be anxious to learn an art which we think so absolutely neces- sary now gentle reader must confess my weakness and tell you that notwithstanding all my care and puzzling after this mathematical truth find the undertaking was too great for iy capacity and therefore from the experience of my folly determined to give up the attempt and flatter myself no farther with such expectations but whenever the rules which have shewn should fail and grow tedious which believe will not happen in matters of consequence ldesign immediately to settle the affair at sight of the object the volutes in the capitals of columns and the twist in stair-cases are objects of this nature and very probably were taken from this an- tique it has also great resemblance to mr. hogarth ’ precise serpentine line and therefore without doubt has some grace though the twist is little quicker it is an object of well-varied contents whose pro- portions gradually lessen to its extremities and its dimensions are governod by fitness variety uniformity simplicity intricacy and quantity what pity it is this venerable object of antiquity should not be represented by the strictest rules of perspective confefs this would afford matter of triumph to any learned critic that is happy enough to succeed in the attempt in pursuance of our present inquiry suppose according to certain chimerical new system the object under our consideration be imagined to have all its inward contents nicely scooped out and the eye at once ta view the whole from within and mark the opposite corresponding parts and take care to acquire perfect idea of the distances and bearings of their several material points and lines in the surfaces or for the more easy description of the projection suppose we were to gauge the contents with wires in order to assist and guide us to readier conception of all che intervening parts leave it to the critics to judge of what use these expedients are towards raising in the imagination true and perfect idea of the antique in question the pamphlet intituled critical examination of the paintings on the ceiling of the banqueting-house at white-hall shews that that celebrated ceiling has nine separate points of sight and that no painting can appear perfectly true unless seen from the point intended by the painter and though picture may be perfectly true from one certain point of view it can not from any other therefore the author has taken great care fo shew the necessity of regarding picture as intended by the painter the picture he fays being alaaays confidered as transparent surfaae ac medium through which the visual rays are sipposed to pass if the spec- tator cbanges his situation those rays in nature will intersect that sur- face in different points and therefore in the picture being determined to such certain points tbe station of the spectator becomes necessarily fixed and unalterable and the picture must appear false seen otberwife suppose we see through window or transparent plane real cube placed directly opposite tho somewhat below the eye in this situation we shall see only two faces one in front and the other at top and if we move to the right or left we must see one of the other faces this ishis proposition which is certainly teue in order to understand the principles of perspective we are obliged to consider the picture as transparent plane thro which the visual rays pafs to the spectator ’ eye but when the design is really picture whose representation is fixed upon some opaque body as board wall or painted cloth that can not be transparent but flat smooth surface and the object represented is -cube that shews only two faces one in front and the other at top tho we move to the right or left from the point of sight we shall never see more by changing the place nei- ther is it reasonable to believe we should for if we find the same appear -- ance tho moved from the point intended by the painter the case is not aktered which shews there is no necessity of having the eye of the spectator exactly in that identical point if the spectator ’ eye must coincide with the point of sight the distance should be considered accordingly and it will then be very difficult mat- ter to come at the proper point of view to see the picture and the more so as its horizon when hung up is seldom so low as the eye own the sight of the pamphlet excited my curiosity to examine the ceiling and find the centre of the whole to be the only point of sight requisite in all that noble design for from the middle of the room saw the intention of that great painter and was convinced of it from the order of the whole and by the natural position of the figures which appeared all finely foreshortened and looked like such living objects viewed from the middle of the room below which was in my opinion the principal point of view that rubens intended for the whole ceiling am also of opinion that all ceilings except those of galleries or long rooms should have but one point of sight and that there are some subjects which believe require no point of sight as living objects represented in the clouds which have no architecture nor any terrestrial appearance which is the case with most of the work in this ceiling and if there is no point of sight required in the work of the picture then think there is none in regard to its being truly seen because the eye can not coincide with the point that never was made or intended it was not material to take notice of the most dry and lifeless part of the performance lexpected mr. highmore would have given us some ingenious remarks on the foreshortenings of the figures and of the excellence of the colouring which presume would have been more agreeable to his readers than telling them that rubens was little deficient in an art which was never understood as he might have said till this century but it is reasonable to believe if his leisure had permitted him to examine the whole he would have found much to commend and very little to censure as it may be expected that should say something of the perspective of shadows shall only observe that the geometrical or perspective know- lege of shadows is of very little consequence to painter it is easily understood when we have learned that of the objects but in my opinion painters may spare themselves the trouble of learning the lineal perspec- tive of shadows because their business is to shun every thing of that nature in picture all the limits and shapes of shadows should vanisn cvery part that is hard and edgy cuts and offends the eye having now given my readers the best insight in my power to the practice of painting and perspective hope they will excuse the size of this treatise which it has been my study from its first projection to con- fine to as narrow limits as possible being from experience convinced that an art if properly can not be too concisely described therefore am forry could not from the nature of the subjects reduce it to fhorter or lesser work
