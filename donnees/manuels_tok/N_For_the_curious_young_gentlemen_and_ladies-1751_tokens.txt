that of drawinc and very juftly for it gives fuch an agree- able reprefentation of things that we are apt to fancy we fee objects which have no real exifience and that the imagery before us which is no more than painted cloth actually breathes the whole creation with all its works and wonders comes within the power of its imitation fets before us things long fince buried in oblivion exhibits to perfect view the moft noted actions of people who have been long in their graves and thews as our anceffors in perfect refemblance of their fearures thro feveral fucceffive generations there is fcarce any art or profettion which receives not fome affiftance from drawinc without her help no defigns or mcdels can be well executed to her the mathematician archifect and navigator is continually indebted no station of life is exempted from the practice of it from the general at the head of an army to the mechanic who fubfifts by his handicraft this excellent art feems inculcated by nature herfelf for we fee it not only practifed by grown proficients but even children frequently drawing various figures and that to curioully as even to aftonith us with their productums that therefore fouth may be inftructed how to attain to good degree of perfection in the art we shall prefcribe the beft rules we are able at leaft fuch as we apprehend are abfolutely neceftary for their information after which we shall give them fome very ufeful and pertinent inftructions for their betrer underftanding of this art for the direction of the young practitioner in the art of deaw in rawing may be defined reprefentacion by lines and shades of any object in nature or art the imitation of another draught or the exprefting the likeness of fomething conceived in our own mind in lmitations of nature or copying from any draught the form and shape of the figures is the firtt thing that makes an impreftion on the mind which is afterwards reduced into form by manual operation which draws the lines hence appears the neceflity of frequently employ- the mind in curioutly obferving whatever objects are propoted to it by which wleans it will be more capable of conceiving rruly and exactly of objects and the hland will more eafily and juftly de- lineate that which is to ftrongly fixed in the memory is highly neceilary for him who would draw well to underfland what is truly good and beauti- ful in draught in order to which the moft expeditious method will be to compare prints and draughts together many painters have grievoully mifcarried by fatisfying themfelves only with imitat- ing had pieces without giving any scope to their own genins of improving their knowledge in judg- ing of the beauties and defects of picture the ideas in our own minds may in great meafure ferve us for model and to improve thefe we should frequently examine the performances of others and our obfervations on pieces that are efteemed correctly done should be nice and critical we should attentively confider every print and draught we fee and every beauty we find in it endeavour to fix on our memory particularly the freedom and boldness of the out-lines and the proportion of the feveral parts above all things it is neceffary that the judgment be rightly informed for then the voung practitioner will make the greater and quicker progress in his improvement than if he goes on in practice without encreafing his knowledge for his succets will be more owing to his genins thin his hand the labour of the hand muft indeed aid and affift that of the brain for whoever would be an able arrift muft by continual practice make the art habitual the rules of all arts are foon learned but to attain perfection in any of them long pradice and striet attention are abfolutely requifite it is true mexim that laziness was never the parent of any thing excellent drawing is not attain- able har by length of time nor perfection in it acquirable unless the iland be frequently employed in the pultice and the mind in judging every day should produce fomething and the hand give frequent proofs of the speculations of the head ac some part of every day should be spent in the practice of this art we would recommerd the murning as fitteft for that purpofe which therefore should be employed in perfecting yourfeives both in judgment and practice he who propofes to gain an entrance into minerva ’ cabinct muft make his approaches gradually thus in the art of drawing tho the reprefentation of the human figure or many figures in piece be the principal object which every practitioner has chieffy in view yet he muft not make this his firft effay but proceed to that by proper and regular steps let the firft part of his study be to draw rreight and curved lines quare round regular irregular and inanimate figures allo parts of human figures as the rye the ear the hland feet oc this will be good foundation whereon to erect his future structure for by this means he will acquire readiness of hand freedom and exactnets in drawing lines and accuffom himself to the exercife of his patience qualifications abfolutely necellary for one who would be eftcemed an exact copier of nature especially in pieces that require length of time and more than ordinary skill in the performance he who begins well has more than half perform ’ his work the out-lines are the circumferent strokes of figure the perfection of good out-line confifts in the freedom and boldness of the stroke and the due proportion of all its parts to attain which the scholar is admonithed to reject all mean and trifling practices fuch as tracing the originals thro oil ’ paper or making ufe of thin paper for the fame purpofe or taking advantage of an artificial light the fe of fuch deceptions will certainly prevent all progress and improvements in drawing neither should the rule and compaffes be ufed except in arcbitetfure or to raife perpendicular in order to form square or fome other figure to draw in or when an artift has finithed his draught he takes this method to compare it with the original to fee whether there is an agreement between them how- ever the bare eye if ufed to it will be fufficient for fuch difcernment for forme tune at firft be fatisfied with practifing upon good out-line without aiming at finithed piece nor is it neceffary that you should as yet hatch or fhade your own draught your out-line at firft maft be sketch ’ with flight and faint touches that you may have an opportunity to amend it where proper which fo will have the less appearance of being retouched in every stroke endeavour an exact imitation and whenever you mend the out-line either by taking away little of its parte or by swelling the others be fure to lofe nothing of the freedom and boldness of it mind frequently to compare your copy with the original take particular notice of what is amiss and let not the leaft fault efcape uncorrected that fo in the draught which you may afterwards make of the fame original thofe errors may be avoided for you muft not pass from one original to another tiil you are in good degree mafter of the firft the beft and jureft method of practice is to make great number of sketches of the fame figure in each of which endeavour to excel what you did in the former in your firtt operations proceed flowly for hafty productions are feldom beautiful or correct and defign is often thus spoiled in the firft attempt it is no eafy matter to amend had habits expedition in performance is acquired by conftancy in practice as the young beginner will have frequent occa- tion for the exercife of his patience he muft be careful to fubdue his paftions in his firfl attempts he mutt proceed deliberately and flowly and ufe his utmoft endeavours to perform well fecure every stroke and try all his skill to make one good draught rather than to hurry over in negligent manner great number of bad ones when you fit down to work and all the time you are at it rake srict and clofe view of your original and in your mind divide it into feveral parts take due notice of the length breadch and similitude of each purt observe the proportion of each to the other and to the whole the diltances between the parrs and the parts that lie parallel or are exactly oppolite to each other when you have finithed your copy and laid afide both the example and draught let your mind be employ ’ for fome time on other affairs then return to it again and view your work afreth and probably you will difcover faults which did not appear to you before eafy to imagine that when the eves have been engaged confiderable time on the fame object the form and shape of it become familiar to him and that on revifal his mind may entertain different notions of it than in the light it appear ’ before and affure yourfelf whatever pains you beflow in reviewing and com- paring your copy with the original draught in order to difcover and amend your faults will vot be ufelets but you will find this advantage in it that it will be means of perfecting you in that particular draught and improve you in the knowledge of lines draughts and proportions and by continuing to practite this method you will in litde time find yourfelf qualified for the exacteft imitations let your out-lines be large and finooth and drawn in flowing gliding manner for if they are too streight they will carry difagreeable stiffness but if drawn according to this direction they will have the refemblance of life and motion and appear with an eaty grace in all your draughts let there be perfect relation between the parts and the whole and uniformity run thro the whole piece that is let every member be made for its own hlead and agree with it you muft not put firong limbs to body that is confumptive or to old age in its decay nor muft you be lets exact in pairing the eyes ilands legs and feet for the leaft dilproportion will be blemith or when any of the limbs are not proportionate to the reft in the inftructions which we shall prefently give the learner will find directions to avoid any fuch miltakes and solecifins when you draw the mufcles take care to infert them according to the rules of anaromy they muft not be crouded into fmall sections but kept as entire as poffible and only the principal mufcles ex- preffed in member which is to express any particular force they muft be thewn large as in the leg when it fupports the body or in the arm when it lifts weight oc and be more well ’ than in any other members thus when the limbs and members are drawn with few and large mufcles they thew themfelves with majetty and beauty fo in draperies the beauty of which confifts not in multiplicity of folds but in their plain simplicity and natural order the drapery muft feem to cover the part loofely for if it be too clofe and hreight the piece will appear too fiff the plaits muft be large folding naturally over the parts which are to be feen underneath which is done by placing properly the lights and shades in covering both the extremities of the joints fuch as the shoulders elbows knees oc care muft be taken to mark them in fuch manner as to diftinguith their shape and in fact drapery is no trifling or intignificant part of this art for if well done it adds new grace to the picture gives an enlivening air to its other beauties and never fails of pleafing the eyes of the spectator materials proper for drawing he materials neceffary for this purpofe are either pencils of black lead or black lead fixed in porcrayon charcoal chalk black red and white paftils or crayons pens hair-pencils and indian ink nothing is more proper for beginners to practife with than black lead in drawing plain lines coc especially as this makes fmoother stroke than can be done by charcoal or crayons cut your lead with penknife till you have brought it to fine point that it may give neat fnall stroke or you may fix piece of the same lead in porcrayon but whatever it is you fketch with ute yourfelf to hold it long-ways in your hand and let your fingers be much farther from the point than the nip of pen is when you write and let your strokes be formed with light gentle touches ihus will you gra- dually acquire ready command of hland and you will with eafe make your our-line free and bold in practifing after limbs and figures it will be proper at firfl to draw the rough skerch with char- coal which is more eafily discharged from paper than slack lead slir your charcoul in imall flender pieces one of which fix in porcrayon the better to hold it then tharpen it to point and lightly but correctly fketch out your original when you have to done if there is any thing you miflike in the performance you may eafily wipe it out by bruthing it with feather or clean rag when you have fecured your out-lines with charcoal proceed thus take feather and wipe them flightly over with it that they may appear faint then go over the lines with black or red-lead and correct them wherever you can if after all this you slill fee any errors to amend take bit of crumb of htale white loaf with which you may difcharge any part of it you pleafe by rubbing it therewich you may afe red-lead or red or black chalk in the fame manner as blick-lead if in heightnings or when you would give ftrong lights or draw on colour ’ puper ufe white chalk and tobacco-pipe clay piffils and crayons are terms which perhaps the learner may not readily underfland they are colours mixed up with tobacco-pipe clay which muft be worked into pafte and rolled up into the thicknels of cuill two or three inches long and then dried when fit for ufe the artiff works with them on colour ’ paper but not in hlatchings as black and red-lead commonly are the colours are rubbed and worked together to that there is no fingle stroke but the whole appears as if only brush had been ufed the crayons is very expeditious manner of drawing and when skilfully handled always produce delicate softness and fine expreftion however it muft be obferved that the careless or rude touch of finger may at once blot out all the beauties of this fine work to prevent which let it be preferved in books or in frame under glafs the crayons will be work ’ more eafily if the grain of the paper be little rough and be express ’ more flrongly than when the paper is quite finooth or if the paper be fomewhat dark or brownith or what they call whiced-brown it will give relief to the tender parts of the work by shewing the light strokes of it in chading draughts fometimes pens are afed for harching the cross strokes however the hair pencil and indian ink ferve much better for this ofe which are not only proper for hatching by strokes but for thading by method much more expeditious that is by wathing which is the fame way of working as with hair pencils and water colours in hatching the shades are produced by lines not unlike the strokes which fhade print engraved but in washing no lines appear but the shades thew them- selves like thofe in metsitinto print of the tints of lights and shadores and shades when judiciouly difpoted give the appearance of subftance nature and diftance to fuch bodies as the pencil repretents suppofe for iaftance circle drawn on piece of paper imagine you fee it fill ’ up with any even colour you can conceive of it no otherwife than as round flat equal body but if you put the hrongeft of the colour in the middle and weaken it towards the extremities you will perceive an agreeable deception and inslead of flat even body it will have the refemblence of ball or globe wherever the colour appears the moft lively there the object catches the eye firft and teems neareft to ir but where the colour weakens and goes off it grows faint and at length feems to tly off and break away from the sight thus the painter by breaking and diminithing his colours throws that behind which he has mind shall be lefs vifible when you round the parts of an object it requires the niceft touch of the pencil to draw the ex- tremities to as that in tarning they shall lofe themfelves infensibly and confafedly without too fudden o of the light into the shadows or of the shadows into the light but let the one pass into the other as it were reciprocally and imperceptibly that is by degrees of light inmo sh dow and shadow into light when your objects are to be painted light you muft allow due breadth of shadow to fustain them if dark fudden light muft rife behind them to feparate them from the ground or from other objects that are placed behind them or elfe they will appear as if they were sticking upon each orher in con- fated manner whereas by juft opposition of light to shade and shade to light projection is given which makes separation of the objects vou muft keep proper ballance between light and shadows and in introducing broad light into your draught you muft give it large shadow you muft make your lights ferve as repote to the darks and the darks to the lights thus drapery which is coloured red or yellow in some places in others will take brown with good effect the hye fees an objet the more frongly and plainly the nearer it is diftance werkens the sight the farther off an object is the more imperfectly it is perceived thofe objects therefore which fland neareft to view should be better finith ’ than thofe which are thrown bekind but obferve that they muft have reciprocal dominion over each other to that as one object by its heightenings forces others to appear at dillance to the fame object maft be thrown farther from the sight than others which are illuminated more krongly it should be farther obferved in regard to lights and shades that it is not enough that remote ob- jects be coloured in more faint and langaid manner but the more or less diffant they are the parts should appear more or lefs confufed the eye can not minutely difcriminate an object which is at diffance from it we can fee human figures at streer length but can not difcern the features of their faces or the plaits in their cloarns to the innumerable leaves of diftant grove appear to the sight but as one mmass white pure and unmixed has two different properties it draws an object nearer to it and it car- ries it off to farrher diftance when it is placed with black the opposition of light and dark brings the object more into view and renders it more fenfible but pure white as it is the lighteft of colours will fy off to the remoteft view unless forced forwards and fupported by black on the other hand pure black is deemed the heavieff moft earthy and moft fenfible of all colours and prefents objects nearer to the sight you muft caft it into maffes confufe it infenfibly and give it its proper repofes in the reprefentations of bodies you muft always give them fuch lights as are moft proper and con- venient for their fppofed situations suppofe the objects before you be in the fields or open ffir and the sun obicured with clouds your bufiness is to introduce an univerfal light tho not vivid or frong your shades too muft be faint but when the sun appears in all its glory your lights muft then be very flrong and bold and the shadows exceeding dark suppofe again that the object you reprefent is in room little tho not very much illuminated and to furvey it you take your station without and ftand level with the light that ftrikes upon it that figure muft have very foff shadows which will thew it very beautifully and tho the shadow be to foft yet the figure will feem as if it were emboffed and have very hold appearance when fmall light illuminates body the shadows on the dark side appear large and their ex- tremities very bold whereas large light renders the shadows on the darker side more diftinct and much fofter in their limitations feseil instructions for the young prattitioner hoever would make any proficiency in the art of drawing muft firft underftand geome- try for it is by this and the help of lines that we are instructed to take the length and largeness of bodies and know whether they be streight or curve round oval square or any other imaginable figure but as it is not our bufinets here to treat of geometry or give thofe geometri- cal rules which are ufed in the art of drawing we shall refer the learner to le clerc ’ practical geo- metry he that would be perfect mafter in the art of drawing muft learn to ketch well to which therefore he ought to give the greatelt attention in copying statue fome perfons begin with the head which they entirely finith before they proceed any farther by which means it frequently hap- pens that they either make the head too little or too big and the other part to difproportionate that there is but small refemblance of the original occafioned chiefly thro want of duly obferving di- fances when therefore you have any thing to draw let your firft care be to divide it into its diffe- rent parts then meafure the diftances in the original with your eye mark the diftances and length of each divifion with faint line on your paper and make sketch of the whole figure before you proceed to finith any part of it fo will you fecure the proportions in the exacteft manner the learner will find among thefe examples feveral draughts of the parts of the face as the eyes nofe mouth viewed in different pofitions all which he should practife upon before he attempts whole face for which purpofe we shall lay down fuch leffons and inftructions concerning an oval with its feveral changes and variations and of the cross in the fame as will enable him to figure all bowings and returnings reclinations and inclinations of all sorts of faces the head you are to obterve has the shape and form of an egg or oval this head has eyes eye-brows nofe and ears which must be placed in their proper situations by running cross thro' the oval by this means you will divide the perpendicular in the oval into four equal parts which will make the head to meafure four nofes in height the face three only the diamerer crofting the perpendicular divide into five parts each being the breadth or wideness of one eye this diameter is called the ocular line or that whereon the lyes are to be placed you muft therefore draw rreight line ii line from the top of the right ear thro both eyes to the top of the left ear and the line drawn from the top of the head down thro the nofe mouth and chin is called the perpendicular cross- ing the diameter or ocular-line at right angles thefe lines together we call the cross of the oval upon which crots whatever situation the face is in you muft place the eyes nofe mouth and ears in proper places when you underfland this thoroughly and have fixed it in your mind you will foon be able to draw good faces out of your own fancy and invention and execute them in mafterly manner but if you accuftom yourfelf to draw only after print draught or picture without knowing the fe of the crots-lines and the proportion of face with its parts you take wrong method don know what you are about and will never attain to any degree of perfection having thus inftracted you in the feveral methods of drawing face we come now to give you the dimenfions and proportions of the feveral parts of the body it was cuftormary with the antrents to allow eight hleads to their figures tho fome of them have only feven the moderns ufually divide figure into ten faces taking if at the crown of the head and ending at the sole of the foot thus from the crown of the head to the forehead is the third part of the face the face takes it beginning at the root of the loweft ifairs on the forehead and its end is at the bottom of the chin painters divide the face into three proportional parts namely the forehead the nofe the mouth and chin the diftance from the chin to the pit betwixt the collar-bones meafures two lengths of nofe from the fame pit to the bottom of the breaft one face from thence to the navel one face from the navel to the privities one face the diffance from the genitals to the upper part of the knee two faces the knee itfelf meafures half face meafure from the lower part of the knce to the ancle and you will find it two faces from the ancle to the sole of the foot is half face when man firetches out his arms as wide as he can line drawn from the top of the longeft of the right hland to the top of the longeft finger on the left will meafure the length of his whole body or he will find himself as broad as he is long the diftance from side to side of the breafts two faces the bone of the arm called humerus from the shoulder to the elbow meafures two faces the bone called cubirus with part of the hland meafuring from the tip of the elbow to the root of the little finger contains two faces from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the collar-bones is one face in taking the meafurement of the breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other to fee if it be equal to the length of the body you are to obferve that the boxes of the elbows with the humerus and of the humerys with the shoulder-blade bear the proportion of half the face when the rms are fretched out the sole of the foot meafures the fixth part of the figure the hand is the length of the face the thumb of the nofe from the place where the pectoral mufcle or that mufcle which makes the breaft difappears to the middle of the arm meafures four nofes carry your meafure from the middle of the arm to the begining of the hand you will find it five nofes your longeft toe is the length of your nofe the tops of the two nipples and the pit betwixt the two collar-bones make an equilateral triangle no certain meafures can be given for the breadth of the limbs becaufe even the meafures are changeable according to the different quality of the perfons and movement of the mufcles thefe farther rules are to be observed in drawing head viz you muft fet the eyes at fuch diftance from one another that you may place one between them mouth when thut has the dimenfions of an eyc the ears are always on level with the eyes -top and below with the nofe whether it be short or long the noltril should be placed exactly againft the corner of the eyc in face that is flat the cheeks fwell out and in one that is lean the checks fall in and the jaw- bones fland out having finifhed our inftructions for the drawing of the face let us now proceed to draw man at full length in the firft place you muft make your oval then divide it as before directed you then draw per- pendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot which you muft divide into eight lengths this will be good direction in placing your figure upright or in whatever action the pofture requires where it either falls in or fwells out you muft make the length of one head be- tween the chin and the breafts the third meafure muft reach to the navel the fourth from thence to the genitals the fifth to the middle of the thigh the fixth comes to the lower part of the knee the feventh to the lower part of the leg and the laft reaches to the heel or sole of the foot in every meafure or divifion you muft take particular notice what touches there are of the mufcles the leg muft be firft drawn on which the body slands then the other after which draw the arms and hands you muft at firft draw all the parts very lightly only with coal becaufe that will give you the leaft trouble in rubbing out or altering the hlands you muft observe are twice as long as broad and each of their parts has its particular length breadth and thickness the nail of the finger makes about half the joint it is upon the leagth of the foot meafures fixth part or ileight of man or five righths more in length than in breadth take noice that the length of the face and hlands are exactly equal and is juft the tenth part of perton height having thus indructed you to draw complete man we shall in the next place lay down fome rules for the drawing of children some will have the length of child to contain five meafures of the head as thus from the top of the head they make three and the thighs and legs two more the breadth between the shoulders is the leagth of head and half the breadth of the body above the navel the length of one head and the breadth of the thickeff part of the thigh is one third of two lengths of the head the breadth of the knee meafures exactly the diftance between the eyes and the chin the brawn of the arm and small of the leg are jutt the thickness of the neck if you take the proportion of child ftanding backward you will find it of the fame meafure as the former if you are defirous of drawing piece well proportioned you muft be very careful and attentive to copy all the feveral parts fingly as the eyes ears cc .vl es for silling up empty figures hu far we have treated of colours and out-lines we come now to infiruct the learner how to fill up the empty figures and to mark the hlatchings to as to produce the beft effect in the firft place obferve that your hlatchings muft confift but of two strokes croffing each other or at moft three to make the ftrongeft shades where the cavities are fuch as require the whole force of your lead or crayon you muft rub it upon your paper as you fee occafion for it would be need- lets trouble to employ more than three hatchings one upon another when with your charcoal you have drawn the out-lines you muft retouch them with your red- lead crayon and then with feather bruth away the dirtinets of the charcoal when you have done that you muft retouch with gentle hand fuch places as have been fouled in the rubbing as the hair eyes nofe mouth fingers toes out-lines let me alfo caution you that in those outs lines which are open to day you make your strokes very light but aronger in thofe which are darkened thus will the out-lines appear in natural manner and add wonderful beauty and grace to human figures and all other objects when this is done you muft begin the shades with fingle hatching but pretty flrong you begin it at the top proceeding infenfibly to the bottom as evenly in the di- stances as you poffibly can you then go on to the roundings which you muft allo express by fingle strokes with fuch light as the object before you requires be cautious not to make your shadows too hard or dark at firft if you would preferve the perspective in the beft manner begin the shadows lightly and faintly and heighten them afterwards and you will foon be pleafed with the agreeable effect instructions how to draw after picture model or the life avin given you the neceffary instructions for drawing prints and draughts we shall in the latt place direct you how to draw after picture model or the life and in what manner you are to place them when you have got picture to draw after be fure to place it in good light to that the sight of your eye and the light of the day may fall together on the picture place yourfelf at moderate diftance according to the largeness or smallnets of the picture at lealt no farther off than that you may with glance of your eye fee the whole picture at once for the larger the picture is at the greater diftance you muft fit to draw it be careful likewife to place your print exactly right before you and let it not he down flat for if it be laid flat you will quickly fee the figures in it fore- shorten ’ the paper you draw upon you muft lay five or fix times double upon pannel board fet in your lap and raifed as high as you can with your knees or let it be refted on form or flooping defk to that your work may fland upon one end before you thus will you be enabled to judge of the similitude between your draught and the original which it will be impoftible for you to do if it lies flat before you the next thing you have to do is to guets as near as you can at the middle of the thing you have to draw whether picture or any other matter then mark it on your paper with the point of your coal when you have done this look for the largeft figures if there happens to be more than one and touch them lightly in proper places and to all that is in the picture you will then prefently difcover whether your gueffing and sketching be true or not but befides this before you draw stroke be fure you do it with good reafon and obfervation and be very careful about the great and general parts and meddle not with the small breakings till the next sketching and by con- stantly practifing in this manner you will infenfibly acquire facility and judgment in your work another rule you are to obferve is always to begin on the right side of the figure for to you have the firft strokes conflantly in your eye and the reft will naturally follow and give less trouble but if you begin on the left side your hand covers the object from your sight having thus made rough skeich you should carefully review and examine it and fee if it be done according to art and if the action of the figure or figures in it be antwerable to the original now as actions are the life of picture they muft thew themfelves in the firft draught however rude it be or you can never expect it will be happily finithed you muft then correct your sketch and improve it in neatness and air by adding and diminithing as you fee proper as you may eafily do with your charcoal but in do- ing this be mindful that you don fpoil the firft good actions in which may eafily be done if you don well obferve the movements of the feveral parts you muft be careful to admit nothing into your work that is improper or foreign to the subject of it and to let nothing trifling have the chief place in it if you can always make choice of north ligbt for your situation becaufe it is less variable than any other should you fit at south window you will find it proper to place safh of oil ’ paper before it which will break the intenfeness of the sun rays and diffufe them more equally without any fenfible variation in drawing after the life you are to confider the bigness or size of the object you have to reprefent and remove from it to the diftance of three times its magnitude and be feared in fuch manner as that your eye may be on level with it and at every stroke you draw be cu- ricus to obferve what parts of your object lie under the perpendicular or principal line the next thing you have to do is to put your figure whether it be the life or model in proper polition the beft light is that which is high and equally diffated not too frong nor glaring when objects are to dispoted you fee all their beauties and the minuteft parts thew themfelves to ad- vantage but this you are to obfervg that in drawing from the life that your light should come from such an altitude as that the shadows of bodies projected on the plane be equal and in propor- tion to their height so that the ligbt does not firike upon or enlighten all the parts fome of which are theltered by the protuberance of others the eyc-brows over- hade the hollow of the eyc the nofe hides fome part of the mouth and the throat is obfcur ’ by the chin for this reafon pour- trait painters blind all the windows of the room they work in except one the lower part whereof they clofe up and let the light in from the upper only which irikes upon the object they are painting after while themfelves are beneath the light directions for the young painter the instructions we have hitherto given the young beginner have been pretty much in the gene- ral we shall now introduce him into every part of his work by fuch particular directions arictly observing them will make him compleat draughtfiman for drawing the face hen you have drawn the circle of the face which you muft do at firft with plain circular line thout making any bending or indentures in or out make stroke from that place of the forehead which is even with the chin town the place where you intend to fix the middle of the nofe and the middle of the mouth this stroke you muft obferve muft be ftruck that way which the face should turn either to one side or ftrait down which stroke will be great help to you in plaring the features rightly to that they may not fland all awry but directly one under another now if the face turn downward the stroke muft be ftruck in fuch manner that the eyes may tarn anfwerable with the face downwards when you have done that make another stroke for the length of the nofe where the end of it should come and another stroke for the mouth that it be not made crooked ftill obferving to make all the strokes to turn one way up or down according as the pace turns that is if the face turns up or down the eyes nofe and mouth muft turn with it when you have made thefe strokes exactly proceed to plice the features according to the preceding rules in the face is ufually obferved this threefold proportion from the top of the forehead to the eye-brows from the eye-brows to the bottom of the nofe from thence to the bottom of the chin this proportion however is not conflantly the fame for in fome perfons the forehead is lower than in others the nofe of fome longer and of fome fhorter than others and therefore this rule can only be obferv ’ in well proportion ’ facc the diffance between the two eyes is juft the length of one eye if in full face but if it turn any thing afide then that diftance is leffened accordingly the woliil ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the mouth muft be always placed between the eyes and the chin juft under the nofe as the greateft difficulty and principal part of this art lies in the lively drawing of the face shall add thefe farther directions to perfect you in this particular branch of your prt firft if you would draw face exactly to as to refemble the original you draw it from you mutt in the firft place take notice of the phyfiognomy or circumference of the face whether it be long or round fat or lean big or little that to you may be fure to draw the phyfiognomy or bigness of the face right if it be fat face you will perceive the cheeks to make the side of the face fwell out and to make the face look as if it were square if it be lean face the jaw-bone will stick out and the checks fall in and the face will look long and flender if it be neither too fat nor too lean the face will for the moft part be round when you draw the utmoft circumference of face you muft take in the head and all with it other- wife you may be deceived in drawing the true bigness of face secondly you muft carefully and judicioufly obferve and difcern all the mafter touches which give life to face or difcover the grace or difpofition of the mind in which lies the whole grace of the work and the credit of the workman thus fmiling countenance is eafily difcern ’ in the mouth when the corners of it are little turn ’ up frowning countenance in the forehead eye-brows bend- ing and the top of the nofe between the eyes fomewhat wrinkled fober and staid countenance is beft difcerned in the eye when the upper eyc-lid comes fomewhat over the ball of the eye laughing countenance is eafily difcerned all over the face and to is an angry wrathful countenance by extraordi- nary frownings there are allo some touches about the eyes and mouth which give life and spirit to face which you will by degrees find out by frequently obferving and imitating the works of the beft marers further rules for the young practitioner in drawing our charcoal being neatly charpen ’ you muft in the drawing of face firft lightly draw the out-rroke or circumference of the face exactly according to the bigness of the pattern making it to fland fore-right or to turn upwards or downwards according to your pattern then make some little touches where the features namely the eyes nofe blouth chin should be placed not drawing them exactly at the firtt when you have thus lightly pointed out the features then begin to draw them more exactly and to proceed till the face be finished which being done then add the beard and other things about it in drawing side-face you need not at firtt draw the nofe mouth and chin that fland in the outmoft line but only make it firft but bare circumference turning this way or that way ac- cording to the pattern and then make the mouth nofe and chin in their places and jutt proportion vou muft be fure to place the mufcles in the right and proper places by the mufcles mean all the shadows that are caufed by fome dents or swellings in the face and be able to find out the reafon of every mufcle that to you may proceed to work with the more judgment the mutcles will be moft vifible in an old wither ’ face and you muft firft draw the moft principal of them and then you may draw the more eafily the leffer within be fure to be very exact in the placing of them or you will spoil your draught be it ever to good obferve to make the shadows rightly and be careful not to make them too dark where they should be faint for if you do you can never recover it to make it light again and to the whole face will be marr ’ and appear unhandsome the shadows are generally fainter and lighter in fair face than in complexion when your draught is finished you will do well to give some hard touches with your pen where the shadows are darkeft which will add great life and grace to your drawing when your face is finithed you come next to the ears and hair wherein you muft obferve this rule having drawn the out-line of it you muft firft draw the principal curl or mafter stroke in the hair which will guide you with eafe to do the leffer curls which depend on them always make your curl to bend and turn exactly according to the pattern that they may hie loofe and faft and not appear fliff rubborn and unpliable when you have drawn your curls exactly you muft in the laft place ftrike in the loofe flairs which hang carelessly out of the curls the face being drawn which is the principal thing in the art then proceed to the ilands and arms legs and feet and to to full bodies of men and women which are the moft difficult things which if you can attain to perform with well grounded celerity nothing will be difficult to you but moft eafy as flowers birds beafts ships or any other thing that is to be drawn by hand of drawing the hlands and feet come now to speak particularly of the hlands and feet which you ought to spend some time about before you come to whole bodies becaufe they will be too difficult for you to enter up- on till you have pretty well practifed your iland in the drawing of other things more especially hlands and feet which are the moft difficult members of the body to draw except the face by learning of which you will attain the reft with less difficulty and greater perfection and undoubtedly it is thing highly commendable to draw hland lively and exactly which hath fuch variety of poftures and action and you will find it no eafy matter to imitate it in every one of them with spirit and life or without some lameness or imperfection the actions and poftures of the hland are fo various that no certain rule can be given for drawing of them only this in general when you firft draw it with charcoal you are not to do it exactly that is you muft not make all the joints or veins or other things to appear more than lightly or faintly and to touch out the bigness of the hland and the manner of turning it with faint touches and not with hard strokes if you have done that right then you part the fingers afunder or clofe according to your pattern with the like faint strokes then mark that place where any of the fingers fland out from the others and make faint refemblance of it having fodone if you perceive your draught to be right proceed to draw it more perfectly and make the bending of the joint the wriff-bone and other principal things some- what exactly and laftly go over it again and draw every fmall bending or swelling of the fingers and make the nails knuckles and veins to many of them as appear and every thing elfe that you can lifcern the proportion of hand you have fufficiently defcribed in the print which thews how many equa- lities or equal meafures there be in it which you should endeavour to be acquainted with that to you may know when hland is well proportion ’ with juft and equal diftances but you are to obferve this rule or exception that according as the hand turns one way or other the proportions muft be thortned according as they appear to the eye as you may fee by the fore-thortning of the hand in the print to much as the hand turns away from our sight to much it lofes of its ordinary proportion and is made to thorten unto that proportion that the eye judges of it nay fometimes whole finger fometimes two or three or more are loft to our sight by the turning of the hand another way from us and to they muft be wholly left out and not made as to the feet it is not to difficult to draw them as it is the hands and you muft proceed in the fame method in the one as in the other when you can draw llands and feet pretty well then proceed to arms and legs wherein is little difficulty after which you may pro- ceed to whole bodies rules to be observed in drawing the whole body wn the drawing of body you muft begin with the head to which you muft give juft proportion and bigness becaufe all the body muft be proportioned according to the head when you have drawn the head proceed to the shoulders and go on to the trunk of the body beginning at the arm-pits leaving the arms till afterwards and to draw down to the hips on both sides and be fure you obferve the exact breadth of the naift when you have done thus draw firft that leg on which the body slands and afterwards that which flands loofe or from the body and laft of all the arms and then the hlands either joined to the body or feparated from it agreeable to your pattern observe in your drawing to place the parallel joints sinews and mufcles directly oppofite in strait even line one againft the other as the shoulders arm-pits waift hips knees and to every thing elfe that one may not be higher or lower than the other that the body may not feem crooked or de- formed but every parallel jont bend coc may directly anfwer the other that is oppofite to it to which end you may flrike ftrait stroke directly cross the shoulders to direct you to place them even and frait one againft the other which you may likewife do in other places as the arms waift hips thighs or any other parts that are oppofite where you should place the one even with the other but you muft have the fame care in all parts of the body as you have in one place where any bendings or members of the body have or do require direct opposition one to the other you make ufe of this help and direction obterve that if the body turn one way or other then this stroke muft be to sruck that it may anfiver the bowing of the body thus if the body ficop little downwards you muft firike the stroke rloping or fide-ways in which cafe you muft make the shoulders and other things which should be ftrait againt one another to be formewhat higher than one another to that the side which the body turns upon the shoulders and other things that otherwife should be placed evehn againft the other muft be made formewhat lower than the other side more or less according to the stooping of the body as you are to be careful in the placing rightly all level or parallel joints bendings sinews and muf- cles to you muft be very exact in all perpendicular joints mufcles that is when you have drawn the out-lines of your piece and are come to draw the joints and mufcles that are within the body you muft be as exact in placing them that is directly one againft another as you are in placing thofe even that are oppofite to one another.. to the end that you may place things exactly perpendicular that is in rrait line one under another you may ftrike ftrait perpendicular line from the pit of the throat down where you difcern the parting of the ribs and to the privities juft in the middle or seam of the body from thence strait down to the feet which line will direct you to place things perpendicularly even that the body may fland frait upright and not appear crooked or awty take notice of the bowings and bendings that are in the body to make that part which is oppoi tite to that which bends to anfwer to it in bending with it thus if one side of the body is bent in the other side muft fland out antwerable to the kending in of the other side if the back bend out the belly must bend in if the belly- come in the back muft stick our if the breech flick our the thigh that an- fivers to it in opposition muft come in to alfo in any other part of the body as when the knee bends out the hams that antwer to it muft come in and the fame rule muft firictly be obferved in all other joints of the body otherwife the body will be made grotly and abfurdly and without any proportion be careful to make all things of an equal proportion and bigness that one arm or leg be not big- ger than the other or one breaft larger than the other or any part of the body in an unjutt propottion but as every thing in face moff anfiwer to the bigness of the face to one member muft anfwer to another in bigness that to there may be perfect harmony in all the parts of the body that it may not have broad shoulders and thin flender waift raw-bone arm and thick gouty leg or any part dif- proportionable from the other unless it be fo that any part of the body doth turn awry from our eye thas if one arm should be feen fide-ways and the other fore-right then the one arm muft be made fo much less than the other by how much it turns away from our sight and appears less to our eye and if one leg be feen full or fore-right and the other leg be feen fide-ways then it muft be made to much less than the other by how much it turns away from your sight as juft proportion muft be obfery ’ in the bigness of your draught to likewife in the length that one thing may not be too long for the other the body not too long for the legs nor the legs too short for the body that neither leg nor arm be disproportion ’ in their lengths but that every thing have its due proportion both for length and bigness unless when the body chortens away in any part from your sight as thus if one leg fland behind the other it muft be made to much thorter than the other according to the diftance it is removed from your eye to likewife if one arm remove itfelf ever to little out of your sight that which comes firft to the eye and flands neareft to the sight muft be made longer than the other and the other be made to much the shorter by how much it turns away from your sight so again if any part of the body be fore-shortned that is if it appears fo to your eye as to hinder the full light of the latitude of that part of the body then the body or that part of the body muft be made to thorten according to that proportion that the eye judges of it observe the due diftance of one thing from another that you may be exact in your draught and perfectly imitate your pattern obferve how much one part of the body slicks out beyond the other or falls in within the other or whether it flands even with the other to which end you may ftrike finall stroke down from the top of the shoulder along by the outfide of the body ftrait down to the feet and this will direct you how far one part of the body should fland out beyond the other and how far other parts should come in let nothing be done without rule and judgment let nothing be done hard charp or curty that is let not the bendings that are in the body or in the joints be made as if they were dents or cuts in the fleth with charp corner strokes but finely round and floping like bendings and not like cuts in the body this is common fault among learners who should therefore be the more careful to avoid it by imitating their pattern exactly in the manner of mak- ing every stroke and touch that is given for nothing should be done without judgment of perspective proportion derspect ive proportion differs much from that we have been hitherto defcribing and may be defined the judgment of the eye of the proportion of thing by its diftance from it as thus if one part of the body come nearer to the eye than the other it is made to much bigger than the other part of the body which turns away from the eye thus if one leg fland behind another the foremoft leg that flands firft in sight muft be made fomewhat bigger and longer than the other becaufe the eye to judges of it it is the fame with regard to any other part of the body the proportion muft be leffend according to the diftance of the object from the eyc the next thing to be obferv ’ in good draughts is graceful pofture and proper action that is that the true natural motion of every thing be exprefted in the life and spirit of it that is the life muft be quicken ’ by art as to express the majefty of king you muft put him in fuch graceful pofture as may move the spectators with reverence to behold him to to make soldier you muft draw him in fuch pofture as may betoken courage boldness and intrepidity fo to make clown he muft be seen in the moft deteftable and clownith pofture to in every other inftance the inward affection and dispo- fition of the mind muft be expreffed in the moft lively manner in the outward action and gefture of the body now to attain competent skill herein my advice is diligently to observe the works of our great mafters of thofe especially who delight in defcribing fight at handi-cuffs to obferve the eyes of private affaffins the courage of wreftlers the actions of stage-players the enticing allurements of courtefans fuch as are led to execution to mark the contracting of their brows the motions of their eyes and the carriage of their whole body to the end you may exprets them to the life in your draw- ings and works another thing to be obferved in good draughts is loofeness or air that is that the body be not made ffiff in any part but that every joint may have its proper and natural bending to as it may with the greateft life express your intention that the picture may not feem lame or the joints fliff as if they were not pliable or capable of bending but every joint or limb muft have its proper and natural pofture according as it may beft fuit with and become the pofture in which the figure is fet another thing to be noted in drawing is what the painters call fore-chortening which is to take things as they appear to the eye and not to draw the full length and proportion of every part but to make it shorter by reafon the full length and bigness is hid from our sight fo if would draw ship standing fore-right there can appear only her fore-part the reft is hid from our sight and therefore can- not be express ’ again if would draw horfe flanding fore-right looking full in my face muft neceffarily fore-chorten him behind becaufe his sides and flanks are hid from my eyc obferve there- fore this rule that you ought rather to imitate the vifible proportion of things than the proper and natural proportion of them for the eye and the underftanding together being directed in the perspective art ought to be the guide meafure and judge of drawing and painting the latt thing to be regarded in good drawing is that every thing be done by the guidance of nature that is that nothing be express ’ but what accords and agrees with nature in every point as thus when would make man turning his head over his shoulder muft not make him turn more than nature will permit nor muft any thing be forc ’ beyond the limits of nature or be made to come short of it but tho nature muft not be firetch ’ beyond its centre yet it muft be quickened to the high- eft pitch of it thus if would express king muft express him in the moft majeftick poffure can invent and if would draw clown muft reprefent him in the moft clownith action can imagine yet muft neither the one nor the other be drawn in fuch pofture as will not agree with the motion of nature that is in fuch pofture which man can not imitate with his natural body fo in all other things nature muft be the pattern of all kinds of draughts rules for drawing landships andskip is the exprefting tract of land by hills woods caffles seas valleys ruins rocks in which there is not to much difficulty as in drawing figures and therefore the fol- lowing rules will he fufficient the belt way of making landlkips is to reprefent them thooting away one part lower than ano- ther as hath been practifed by our beft artifts but others have run into contrary error by making the landlkip mount up higher and higher till it reach to fuch height that it feems as if it touch ’ the clouds as if the drawer had ffood at the bottony of steeple when he took the prospect which is alto- gether incongruous for we can difcern no profpect at the bottom of hill but the moft proper way of making landlkip is to make the neareft hfill higheft and fo to make the reft that are at greater diftance to thoot away under that that the landlkip may appear as if taken from the top of an hill be careful to leffen every thing in proportion to its diftance exprefting it bigger or less according to the diftance it is from the eyc vou muft make all your lights fall one way both upon the ground and trees and all things olfe and all the shadows muft be caft one way vou muft give every thing its proper motion as trees when they are thaken with the wind their finaller and more pliable boughs muft be thewn in fuch an action as if they struck one againft another by yielding and declining from that paft whence the wind blows the stiffer boughs have less bending and motion you muft likewife obferve the bending of twig when birdfirs upon it fo likewife if it be forced or preffed with any otfer thing clouds in the air maft be thewn with motions now gathered together with the winds now violently carl make nothing condented into hall thunder bolls lighthing rain and fuch like finally but what requires motion pechliar to itfelf according to which it ought to be reprefented but this rule you muft always obferve natmely that all your motions which are cauled by the wind muft be seen to move one way becaufe the wind can blow but one way at once always express fair horizon fhewing the heavens cloudy or clear more or less according to the oc- cation and if you express the sun let it be cittler as rifing or setting and as it were behind or over fome hill or mountain the moon and starsare feldonr or never depicted unlets it be in reprefentation of twilight becaufe all things are supposed to be feen by day if ye on express the sun make his light to reflect upon all the trees
