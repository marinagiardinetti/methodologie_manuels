inircdugtion he urility of the following compendium will appear to all who consider the variety of substances which are employed in composing many colors and other materials used in the arts it is to be re- fretted that some professors are not more intimately acquainted with this part of science but to the student for whose service this compilation is chieffy intended such information is evidently of great retvantage an injudicious mixture of pignents contrary in their natures and properties produces very dis- agreeable consequences is universally agreed as indeed might naturally be expected from the various dissimilar origins of the ingredients of which some ate productions of the animal others of the regetable kingdom fossils afford some and mine fals others beside this they have undergone vari- ous modes of preparation for use for some can not be used without calcination others will hot bear the fire some constantly retain their proper hues others though brilliant at first after while become totally corrupted and by their corruption they in- jure or destroy their companions which might otherwise have stood well it appears evident there- fore that knowledge of the origin of any pis- ment may conduce much to beneficial association of it with others no doubt many other substances beside those in common use might be of great service if their pro- were more sausfactorily understood or if better methods of managing them were discovered which can only be the result of experiment more- over we know that foreign countries afford variety of materials different from our own which are used by the artists of those countries it would be des sirable acquisition as well to the study of natural history in general as to the arts if gentlemen who have opportunity would inform themselves on such subjects of their origin their manner of tieatment and their mode of preparation for use of their han tures and their effects and if they could import samples for examination by our own artists not only those artists but perhaps by some happy dis- covery the nation might become obliged to their ry laudable endeavours our own kingdom and its dependencies afford variety of substances which we now receive from foreigners it would be well worth while for examine our nlative productions with reference to theirt fure ther utility not to mention the pleasure arising from investigation of every part of the works of nature it i submitted to gentlemen and to artists who reside parts of the kingdom that such intelligence of british productions might be very acceptable to ariists in other parts of the kingdom whose situation detains them from such knowledge and in particular it is submitted to artists that as the perfection of art is only to be attained by liberal communication of im- provements which becur to individuals by such generous behaviour and by such only can the arts attain that excellence which is the earnest desire of every genuine artist such information would be valuable to the public since thereby many expensive materials might be su= perseded by others equally serviceable at much less price or improvements on those now disre- garded might render them objects of greater atten- tion whereby not unfrequently our manufactures as well as the arts might derive great advantage in some degree on this principle few articles not in general use are admitted into this collection for though their own services are but small they may afford hints to aid the discovery of others more valuable it has indeed been our endeavour to insert chiefly those articles whose utility may be depended on for it seems injudicious to burden this part of especisliy in work like the present with cipp on re on is in for at tr ig his slss recipes even while we have endeayoured intre id neren that nothing really worthy our readers attention should be omntted intent of this work is not to instruct masters but learners nor can much novelty be expected on the subject though there are many original recipes but let it come from what quarter it may infok- mation is equally useful and valuable to the student to close these remarks â€”it should be recoilected that some colors cc are dangerous to health with- out due circumspection in preparation and manage ment to guard against accidents from such is very desirable and is sufficient to prove the ntility of the present work in which somewhat of their natures and effects are explained the ar ag li nis id tlect at piits tite ii eni the prices marked to many of the following articles may serve as useful

the western coast of england prepared arcbill will yield violet color to water which stains marble deeply and renders it more brittle linneus thinks many common mosses might yield celors at least the experiment on the most is worth making arsenic native is called orpiment it is of yellow or orange color though always yellow its color admits of different shades and mixtures golden reddish or greenish the satal effects which may by accident arise from this substance will justify our forbidding its admission into the collection of colors of our young friends asphialtum is solid bristle black inflam- brtuminous substance resembling pitch it is chiefly found swimming on the surface of the lacus aspbathtes or deadsea where anciently stood the cities of sodom cc being thrown to the surface of the water it there swems like other fat bodies and gradually is condensed by the heat of the sun and its own salt it burns with great vehemence in which it resembles naphtha but it is firmer in consistence genuine asphaltum has no smell is not acted on by water by aqua-fortis or by olive oil it is principal ingredient in etching ground and is used in oil painting but must not be too much trusted to it gives the appearance of age to pic tures price to per ounce asphaltum is excellent in the shadows of flesli draperies fore-grounds exc and particularly in scumbling but when used alone it is apt to turn black it is therefore necessary to imix it with lake or blue or terra de sienna any of which colors mix well with it and effectually prevent its chang= ing this color being now much in use perhaps t much we give the following receipt for mak= ing it receipt for making asphaltum put two ounces of balsamo de capivi into peal or dipkin over slow fire until it boils then put in one of aspbaitum and as much oil of turpentine as will make it liquid care must be taken to pre- went its taking fire this receipt with the method of using the asphaitum was communicated by mr. mengs and is used with success after glazing it will be proper to put the picture in the sun in order to hasten the drying of it another method of preparing asphaltum welt two ounces of oleo dabezzo or venice tur pentine over slow fire in glazed vessel then add one ounce of aspbattum little bruised when melted thin it properly with oil of turpentine when you add the turpentine take it from the fire the best method of preparing asphaltum is to melt it over slow fire in the clearest bal- de capivi observing it continually until it is quite melted and never to use it before the picture is very dry then rub the part which you design to glaze with little of mengs varnish which must also be dry before you attempt to glaze it mix the asphalrum with little oil of poppy to prevent its being too sticky in glazing this is the best me thod of preparing and using aspbaltum for which we are obliged to mr. west avignonberry called also prench-berrt and tellow-berry is the fruit of

best is said to be procured from vine-stalks and rendrils price to per ounce kept in the color-shops in bladders ground in oil at each lamp-black originally perhaps the soot collect- ed from lamps is generally prepared by melting rosin or prick in iron vessels then setting it on fire under proper receptacle for the smoke which is the tamp-black it is brought chiefly from sweden and norway where it is frequently obtains ed from the refuse of the tree left in preparing rosin or pitch it is the basis of the ink used by letter-press printers the black takes fire very readily the best method of extinguishing it is by linen hay or straw wetted water alone will not succeed this color is not much in request for oil pictures as it requires forcing to make it ary lvory-black is made of ivory burnt or char- red between two crucibles well luted being thus rendered perfectly black and in scales it is ground and made into cakes ecc the goodness of vory-black may be known by the fulness of its color free from any blue cast and by its fineness little white sugar-candy prevents this color when used in water and others from cracking it is used in painting in oil but is commonly rejected from use in water indian ink answering much better price per bladders each horn-elack is inferior to ivory-black it is made of bones burnt german of frankfort black is made of the lees of wine burnt and washed and afterwards ground in mills on purpose with ivory or with peach stones burnt it is principal ingredient in the ink used by rolling-press printers the french superior to the german to try its goodness it is pat into the mouth if free from grit and of black it is good earth black is kind of coal which well pul- verised is used in fresco burnt paper ground finely is said to make good black peach stones burnt make very fine black of bluish cast much used in france cherry stones may be substituted indian-ink is an admirable composition not laid like our writing inks but solid like our mine- ral colors though much lighter it is made in all figures but the most usual is rectangular about of an inch thick sometimes the sticks are gilt with various devices to use this ink there must be little hollow marble to be had at any color-shop or other stone with water in it on which the stick of ink must be rubbed till the water becomes of suffi- clent blackness dutch tile or piece of ivory or other neat substance may serve as substitute it makes very black shining ink and though apt to sink when the paper is thin yet it never runs or spreads so that the lines drawn with it are always smooth and evenly terminated how large soever they be itis of great use in designing because its tone of color may be augmented or dimiaished of gs at pleasure it is imitated by mixing any plack prepared from linseed oil by hanging large copper pan over the flame of lamp to receive its smoke with as much melted glue as is requisite to form it into cakes these cakes when dry answer well enough in regard both to color and to freedom and smoothness of working irory black and other charcoal blacks levigated very fine have the same effect with lamp-black it is not easy to distinguish the best indian-int from the inferior the usual manner is by rubbing the stick on the back of the hand or any other place previously werted but frequently the sticks are coated with fine sort and the part within is worthless the makers generally scent the best with the best musk in using indian-ink it should always be remem hered that light color may be darkened by addi- tional washing but that which is too deep can not lightened the safest and best way to proceed gradually from weak tint to stronger till the farious parts obtain the force intended price per stick from tc bice see bicl blue ashes cendres blen corruptly sunders blse are used in water colors some are very live ly but in oil they become dull they are found among coppermines water only is used in levigat- ing them to reduce them to fine powder this blue ought to be used in works to be seen by candle light as scene painting for though mixed with much white it retains its beauty there is nothing to be found in the shops under this name but common verditer or some species of it blue prusstan is modern invention conside fably in use among painters though inferior to ultramafine blue it was discovered by accident about the beginning of this century chemist of berlin having successively thrown upon the ground several liquors from his laborttory was surprised to see it suddenly stained with most bedutiful color recollecting the liquors he had thrown on each other he made sinilar mixture in vessel and produced the same color he did hot publish his process but prepared and sold his thie which was substituted for ultramarine the account of it was first published in the berlin memoirs but without description of its process in paper of dr. woodwards communicated to the royal society there is given short way ofmaking prussian blue which was found to answer perfectly well and occasioned several experiments whereby was discovered the nature of the substances iused in that preparation the method was this four ounces of bullock' blood dried and four ounces of sait of tartar pre- pared from four ounces of crude taftar and as much hitre were calcined together two hours after which black spungy substance remained in the crucible weighing four ounces solutioh of which being made itn boiling water and afterwards filter- ed left remainder which when dried werghed hine drams an ounce of english vitriol was dissolved in six ounces of rain water and eight ounces of crude allum was also dissolved in two quarts of water these being mixed hot with the blood became green but on adding two or threey ounces of spirit of salt they became of fine blue vol ii edit subsided and left the water clear the pros duet was an ounce of very fine color fit for the palette the experiments made by mixing in dif- ferent manners and proportions the several liquers of which this color was prepared all produced blue but in different degrees some being deeper others paler in one experiment the allum was wholly left out and very pale blue was produced in another the allum and vitriol were used in equal quantities then the blue was extremely deep in all receipts given for making prussian blue the liquors are ordered to be mixed together boiling hot except the spirit of salt and the color is most readily and beautifully made this way method of making prussian blue in perfec- tioh has been purchased as very valuable secret its process is very extraordinary and could scarce be derived priori from any reasoning about the nature of colors it is allowed to be an excellent blue pigment in point of color but its durability is justly suspected it should not therefore be used in works of consequence the goodness of prussian blue must be distin- guished by is brightness deepness and coolness four different processes given for making the finest sort of prussian blue with quick lime are given in the hist of the acad of sciences at parss for the year take of ox blood dried and re- duced into kind of small scales an equal quantity of quick-lime newly baked of red tartar and of saltpetre pulverise the whole grossly and put it into crucible placed in the midst of great furiace and give it gradual fire after four hours when the matter is reduced into kind of paste which emits no more smoke and is equally red throw it by spoonfuls into two pails of boiling water and having fillrated the lixivium mix it with solution of of allum and of green vitriol this operation will yreld but secuta but its beauty will make sufficient amends for the small quantity as it will surpass in this respect all prussian blues prepared by other me- thods it has also as good an effect as the finest ultramarine and has besides the advantage of resisting the impression of the air process il take of dried ox'sblood an equal quantity of quick-lime of red tartar and nitre let them be calcined and lixiviated as in the former process pour the lixivium into soln- tion of of allum and of green vitriol this operation will yield more of the blue secula than the other but the color will be less beautiful process iii take of dried oxs blood of quick-lime of red tartar of saltpetre proceed as before this operation will produce most beautiful blue but the quantity will be only about and drams process iv take of dried ox blood of quick-lime of red tartar and ilb of nitre calcine and lixrviate as before pour the warm lixi- vium into selution of of allum and iltgret vitriol the secula precipitated in this waywis be as beautiful as those of the first process and the quantity nearly ounces the price of that kept in

from to per ounce blue turnsol is made of the seed of that plant by boiling four ounces of turnsol in pint and an half of water in which lime has been slacked nit boyle has given us the following method of making trapsparent blue nearly equal to ultrama rine the principal ingredient is the eyamis of blse corn-bottle-flower which may easily be pro cured during the summer months this flower has two blues in it pale color in the large outer leaves and deeper blue in the middle of the flower these produce much the best color this may be observed by rubbing the leaves while fresh on piece of writing paper so as to express the juice which will yield an excellent color that by the experience of two or three years has not been found to fade sufficient quantity of these middle leaves being procured let the juice be pressed from them to which little allum being added will give lasting transparent blue scarcely inferier in brightness to ltramarine is very probable that if the chives of these fowers were cured in the same manner as saffron they would produce much greater body of color from which tincture might be drawn with more case than when pressed fresh from the field mr. boyle also recompmends another fine blve produced from the blue leaves of rue beaten in stone mortar with wooden pestle and then put into water for fourteen days or more washing them every day until they are rotten these beaten up at last water and all until they become pulf and then dried in the sun will make fine blue for shading blue transparent for washing maps cc take half pound of the best french verdigris add six ounces of red argil let them soak together about six and thirty hours in about two quarts and half of fair water then boil them till the in- gredients are dissolved let the liquor sertle and pour it off united with the tincture of avignon-berry it makes an excellent green and will keep well to secure which you may add little spirits of wine it is necessary to caution our friends against morst- tening the pencil used in this color with the fongue or by any other means admitting the color into the mouth as the verdigris is apt to occasion disagreeable sickness bralil-wood is south american production variously denominated according to the places from whence it is brought as from fernambuc japan wt martha cc tree grows in dry barren places or on rocks is very thick and large usually knotted and crook ed the thickness of the tree is chiefly owing to gross coat of bark which when removed reduces the trunk to less than half its former size the howers which are of finered exhale very agree able scent this wood is very heavy and dry that of fernam buc is the best it should be chosen clean close sound and free from bark from the best brazil-wood is procured kind of carmine by means of acids tincture is drawn from it thus infuse quarter of pound of brazil-wood which may be bought in chips or shavings in about two quarts of water when it boils add nearly an ounce of rock allum powdered strain the liquor when of the strength desired this may be evaporared to very deep color or the wood once boiled may yield weaker tincture it requires no great skill in using red ink is made of it by boiling quarter of pound of the raspings in vinegar wherein it has been infused two or three days then while hot filtering it through paper in an earthen cullender then heat it again and add half an ounce of gum arabic and when that is dissolved of allum and of white sugar half an ounce each acids turk solution of brazil-wood yellow alka- lies change

berries furnish three kinds of colors being gathered green dried and steeped in water yellow when ripe sap-green vide sap-green when fully ripe and ready to drop from the branches purple bokes for colors are of many various con- trivances according to the purposes of those who use them the general principles to be regarded in construc- ing boxes are that all articles of similar nature should be collected nearly together colors in oil by themselves colors in water by themselves boxes complete to hold variety of colors vaf nishes cc are sold frohm to each portable boxes afe much cheaper but are usually contrived by their proprietors cklcination differs from mere burning in that the latter leaves the substance butnt of black color the former leaves it white calcination in- creases the weight of lead which thereby becomes red mintum almost one-fourth calauing is term used where the back of any design is rubbed over or coated with fine powder such as black lead red chalk xc and the lines of the drawing by point traced over them are trans= ferred to paper laid beneath the back so coated this operation is useful where an original is to be copied of the same size care must be taken that neither the original or the copy be moved from their exact situation with respect to each other during the operation lest the parts transferred should be false drawings intended to be made in fed chalk should be calqued by red chalk not by black lead as that has greasiness which refuses to cut chalk properly nor by black chalk since the lines may then injure the drawing by their different color from the rest of it calauing is likewise used to signify the taking an impression from drawing in chalk by passing it through rolling-press with sheet of wet paper upon it the use of this procedure is to transfer on the wet paper the powderly particles of the chalk used in drawing and to fix those remaining in greater security from their being rubbed and sneared the tone of the drawing is rather deep- ened than lightened by this operation the copy on the paper will be an exact reverse of the original several drawings laid on each other may be passed atwace but if they are passed more than one way there is hazard of their being moved and isplaced in their passage back sometimes prints are calqued by dissolving part of their ink by means of soap and transferring it to ground or white paper ec drawing in water colers may be calgued by pass- ing over the outlines with good black-lead pencil them warming the plate on which the ground is laid so as hardly to melt the ground and laying the drawing on it pass them through rolling-press properly adjusted this method succeeds very well for landscapes or if tracing be made with red chalk ground with water only the colors will wheh passed through rolling-press be transferred to the ground on the plate campeachy-wood is nearly related to bra- and by no means superior for its utiliry in the arts but it furnishes good purple carmine is bright deep rich crimson color bordering something on purple used constantly in water colors but very rarely in oil because it will not mix kindly in oil as well as because of its high price it is color which spends well car- mine is the most valuable product of the cochineal mestigete it is fecula or sediment of water wherein i steeped cochinesl erc thus vol ii edit rain water wherein thirty-six grains of chougn have been boiled three times and strained care added five drams of cochincal and this likewise ys boiled three times then add eighteen grains of achiotte or roucou if thought proper and the same quantity of rock allum this liquor is boiled once then filtered through linen cloth and suffered to stand till it has deposited its sediment which when dried is the carmine the additional ingredients are perhaps better omitted and we believe at present generally are omitted since carmine is nothing more than the coloring particles of cochincal dissolved in an alka line lixivium and precipitated by allum some give the following process to obtain carmine from scarlet wool boil the wool in strong ley of pot-ashes till it has lost its color then filter off the ley with which incorporate sufficient quantity of allum and filter the liquor the carmine will remain in the filter an inferior kind of carmine is made of brazil tgood by steeping one pound of raspings in white wike vinegar during three or four days with some gold leaf beat fine in mortar boil the liquor about half an hour and strain it through coarse sieve temper in another vessel eight ounces of allum which add to the crunson liquor stir them well together the scum is the carmine an extempore carmine tincture is made by putting thirty or forty grains of cochineal bruised into gallipot with as many drops of tartar ley as will just pmoisten it then add as much fair warer as you desire the color to be deeper or fainter it is now purple but by adding small quantity of allum very finely pulverifed or scraped it will become crimson strain if and use it speedily for it will not keep cochineal tincture is heightened in its coler by spirits of urine is turned purple by saccharum saturm andby quick-lime is rendered fading though extremely beautiful in no commodity is purchaser more likely to be imposed on than in carmine its brightness of color and fineness as powder should be attended to prices to per ounce none good under this price some bigber up to two guineas per ounce charcoal is an artificial coal or fuel being wood half burnt and then extinguished it is an excellent material to sketch with in beginning design as it may be brushed out even by feather the softest kind is preferred which is that made of the willow chalks are very useful in the art of design being usually put into the hands of beginners we have white red and black chalks white chalk of the best quality is usually brought from ltaly which country does not possess our common chalk but distinct species italian chalk is in its texture more firm and compact its touch is uch smoother and neater than any other consequently it may be used on smaller subjects the same remark is just on the black chalk of laly white chalk is soft and adapted oufr for large subjects as are all the chalks of france its black chalk is only fit to be used where expedi dition admits of stumping considerable quantivies of spanish chalk are imported which is in fexture between the foregoing but not very smooth red chalk is very much used in design it is in general of kind and moderate temper and readity forms grain it is however very far froth cleanly inits nature and is apt to smear and stain whatever it touches the precautions necessary to guald against this quality in fact contribure to its useful hess since whoever having been habitnated to red chalk can draw clean with it is secure from injury by using other materials red chalk is best used simply on white paper but some shadow it with black chalk or stump in black chalk first into the shades and relieve with red black and wbite chalks mutually assist each other on paper whose color serves for demi-tint the bad is quite worthless chalk to be good should be free from grit and not too hard price varies according to quality from per ounce to is drug used by the dyers in dying red especially crimson and scarlet and it is

bodies of rregular figures but usually convex ridged and furrowed on one side the color of the best is purplish grey powdered with kind of white dust cologne earthl is of deep brown color in oil but mere in water colors it is very singular substance reckoned by the colormen not little troublesome to manage it has been and still is by some accounted genuine earth but athers say it contains great proportion of regetable matter it does not form like other earths regular of entire stratum where it is found but is gathered in large flat separate masses among other strata it is moderately dry while in the earth and of texture soft and crumbling when dried it becomes more compact and united is very light smooth and easily reduced to pieces adheres firmly to the tongue and is very astringent

their sap in the spring of the year when cut genuine copal is very rare but in default of this is brought from the west india islands another kind which is the only one to be procured from the druggists from this guin as it is called but improperly is varnish which being digested in oil is esteemed friendly to oil pretures and is in request proper quantity dissolved in linseed oil with nearly heat enough to boil or discompose the oil is diluted with oil of turpentine and forms transpd rent varnish which when slowly dried becomes very hard so hard indeed that it is said if the picture underneath it wants alterations they may safely be inserted on the varnish instead of first clearing the varnish from the picture price of the varnish upwards for vial of two ounces crayon is general name for all colored earths or other substances used in drawing or painting dry without oil or water ecc crayon substances are erther natural or artificial natural when the material is of proper color and consistence and admits of being cutinto convenient size and form such are chalks whose uses we have nouced such are black lead charceal ec but in general crayons are compositions of colored pig- ments previously reduced to powder and re-com- posed into proper mixture and form the art of composing crayons depends principally on the mixture of the component colors and on the adaptation of the vehicle by which they are held incorporated this is evident if we consider with respect to the brilliancy or the truth of the tone of color that it depends on the admission of more or less of any certain pigment and that all com- pound colors by possessing too much of any one color which enters into their composition may prove when used unfriendly to their neighbours that the vehicle of importance appears from the consideration that scarce any two earths are equally tenacious whence it follows that as some naturally of loose texture are not without difficulty held by strong binders others naturally compact would be rendered by such binders almost stones and in- deed these are the prevailing faults among those usually offered for sale it is perhaps proper to remark that although sofi crayons are preferable generally yet crayons may be soft even for large works and that for smaller works they may be never the worse if little firmer yet preserving the utmost distance from bardness soft crayons may however be used in large per- formances but those which are too hard to give their colors freely or without wetting are to be rejected as totally useless for smaller works crayon pencils have lately been composed whose utility depends like thar of the former on their temper they have unquesting an advantage in neatress and security from being broken by accidents price about eath many very different vehicles have been suggested bind the colors which form crayons catmes boiled thick milk ale-wort gums glues be without entering into the merit of their varion pactensioks we believe that pale ale-wort as ve hicle sufficiently strong to hold the tender pigments which yet may be weakened to accommodate the firmest has been most used but as this has som color which is most sensible in the higher tints others prefer spirits of wine which has no color any tint crayons must be made in great variety of tints t supply readily what tone of color may be requin ed this variery is obtained by mixture with each other hence it follows that according to the judg ment of the composer their tints will vary though we do not suppose that many of ou readers will take the trouble to make sets of crayons yet as it may happen that some acquaintance will the manner of proceeding for that purpose may be of use occasionally we shall offer some notices of the mode best esteemed procure large flexible pallet knife flat stone of proper size and smaller with which to grind the xolors also two or three large flat pieces of chall use is to absorb the moisture

folling into foriti cc atso proper vessels to hold spirits water or other figuids as they may wanted white chalk is so readily offered by nature that it seems perfectly adapted without receiving any labour to be used as crayon of the first order but as chalk is rarely so free from grit or small stones as might justify our placing any confidence in it to purify and improve it is the province art chalk is whiting and as whiting is ex- tremely cheap we consider this material as miost for our purpose yetas whiting may be capable of still further putiry we proceed to re- commend the washing of it in the following mafi- her â€”take large vessel of warer put the whiting into it and mix them well together set this stand about half minute then pour off the top into ane- ther vessel and throw the gritty sediment away let what is prepared rest about minute atid pour it off as before which will purify the whiting and ee it free from all firt and grittiness theh tofi is done let the whiting settle and pour the from ii after which lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for tse either fof white crayons of for the purbose of preparing titts with other colors for with this all other filits ttlay be saiery repared the student chooses mane trayons of whiting inmediately after it is washed it is not necessary to it on the chalk for it hay be mixcu jusianfly any other color which will save considerable vol ii edit trouble ... all colors of heary or gutty nature espectally biae veraner must be purined by wash. he tttes atter this method observe that if crayons are too thin if they have too much morsture in proportion to their quan lity of color they will dry too flat if they are too tbock ne if they have too much color in prover to their moisture they will occasion waste color by their adherence to the palette knss the general rule is when the crayon made to lay it on the chalk that its moistune may be absorbed to proper deoree- that decrees determined by the feel of the crayon in the hand it lose the greater part of its adhesive quality and in to te bots in at seem of prover consistency then it may be lad the glass which will not dry it so fast as the would have done

their different com- binations the different compositions of colors must be cut into proper lengths after they are prepared in order to be rolled into pastils for use each crayon should be formed by being rolled in the left hand with the ball of the right and be formed firstcylin- drical then taper at each end if the composition be too dry dip the finger in water if too wet the composition must be laid on the chalk again till more of its morsture is absorbed the erayons should be rolled as quick as possible and when finished must be laid upon the chalk again to lose all remaining morsture after the gradation of tints from one color are formed the stone should be well scraped and cleansed with water before it for another color it is impossible to lay down rules for mingling of every tint necessary in composing set of cray- ons there being many accidental compositions en- firely dependant on fancy and opinion the stir- dent should make it rule to save the leavings of his colors for of these he may form many varioils tints which will occasionally be useful we suppose now that we desire to make crayons of any color in this case we first prepare the simple color grinding it with spirits of wine till it be perfectly smooth fine and even then taking proper quantity of it we lay it on the chalk till somewhat advanced toward dryness then we roll it and form it and return it to the chalk to be finished drying theroughty of the cofor which remaing ready ground we proceed to compose tihts of vai ous shades by mixture with the purified chalk whiting already mentioned â€”as thits take some of the simple color and levigate with spirits of wine adding about one part of washed whiting to three parts of color of which when properly incorporated make two parcels the new gradation should be composed of two equal quant ties of color and whicing of which four crayons may be made the third composition should have ope fourth color and three fourths whiting of this mate sir arayons which will be good proportion with the rest the last tint should be made of whiting very faintly tinged with color of which make abou eight crayons which will complest the above-mes tioned proportion as these compound tints are levigated they are to be laid immediately on the chalk that the morsture may be absorbed to the groper degree for their formation into crayons its consistency be

prepared in the following manner put four ounces of amber into crucible and melt it with small degree of heat pour it out upon an iron plate when cold reduce it to powder and add to it two ounces of drying oil linseed oil thickened by being boiled up with litharge and one pint of oil of turpentine dissolve the whole together into liquid varnish this simple amber varnish is of great use for many purposes and is said to be the basis of the fine var- msbes which we see on coaches and might be ap- plied to pictures with good effect copal oil varnish called in france sepis markn is made by pouring into strong well pap f earthen pot in shape resembling choee late pot and in size-large enough to hold abouy vallon and made warm four ounces of chie turpentine and when this is dissolved cop ounces of finely powdered amber mingling then well and setting them on the fire for quarter of hour take off the pot and pour gently into its pound of copal finely bruised bur not powdered stir the mass and add four ounces of chio turpes tine and gill of warm turpentine oil then setp on brisk fire for about half an hour and takings off stir the contents well and add two ounces of the finest and whitest colophony ler the pot be piu on very brisk fire and remain till the whole and become as flaid as water let it be removed from the fire and remain for few minutes and then gradually pour in twenty-four ounces of pop nut or linseed oil made drying and boiling her and stir the mass with deal suck when the oums and oil are thoroughly incorporated set then the fire for few minutes still stirring about and let them boil once up and having taken off the pot pour into it quart of hot turpenting stir them together and give them one bon up take off the pot and pour into it pint more of hol turpentine still sturring well.. if the gums gre thoroughly melted and well incorporated the varnish is made which being cool is strained through close cloth into another vessel and if too thick

quart the birmingham varnish is yet better there being no oil in it put it into an earthen pip- kin set it over very gentle fire it need not boil if pretty hot it is enough at the same time set ahnother pipkin over the same fire containing three half pints of turpentine and half pint of strong drying oil mixt together when hot take both pots off and pour the varnish in very small quantities into the turpentine and oil every time replacing the pots on the fire to preserve the heat repeat this several times dozen at least till the whole mixt keep it continually sarring to incorporate them well take it from the fire as soon as possible lest it brown the varnish were they put together cold too hastily or in too large quantity at time the copal would be precipitated to the bottom let it stand to clear well stopped in bottle for use so much oil being thrown into it prevents its cracking and makes it more proper for oil paintings it is long in drying and must be kept free from dust after two or three days it sets and retains no stickiness as mastic cc always does vol ii edit small pictures may be neatly painted with this varnish alone this varnish hardens so strongly on the picture that it can not be taken off again but must be painted over if any alterations are intended varnish that may easily be removed is made of isinglass diluted with water with the addition of one-fourth or one-fifth the weight of the isinglass of sugar or honey sponge and hot water will readily remove this from the picture ec over which it is used mastic varnish is made by putting five ounces of powdered mastic into proper bottle with pound of spirit of turpentine and setting them to boil in balneo marix till the mastic be dissolved and straining the solution through hannel this varmsh may be converted into varnish for painting with by grinding one ounce of guin anme on stone with water till it becomes an impalpable powder then drying it and grinding it again with half an ounce of turpentine and after wards with the proper colors and morstening it with the mastic varmsk till the mixture be of due consistence for working with the pencil it must then be kept in phials or in vessels and diluted as there may be occasion with spirit of turpentine price as or per pint others recommend the following mastic varnish as very useful for glazing â€”twelve ounces of pure mastic put to one quart of spirit of turpentine in glazed earthen pot for safety have large iron heater made nearly red hot on this set the pot in soie open place where free from danger let it boil very gently about minute it is easily dissolved even without boiling keep stirring it with stick when melted set it by to clear itself keep it in bottle well corked for use to make the varnish recommended by nengs to two ounces of the finest mastic in powder add fourounces of aqua di rbasa mix them in glazed pot which must be set in pan of boiling water and there continue over slow fire for one two or three hours as shall appear necessary to bring it to proper degree of consistence for drying in short time after it is laid on the picture this varnish may also be prepared by being dissolved in the sun in using this varnish great care must be taken that the picture is quite dry and has been painted five or six days at least even then it will be proper to let it stand for short time either be- fore the fire or in the air but the varnish must not be laid on before the pieture is quite cold after the picture is varnished it will be proper to let it lie for day or two free from dust after which you may work upon re-touch or re-paint it as often as you shall think necessary but it will be proper to re-var- nish the piece when you have completely finished it aqua di rhasa is spirits of turpentine to make white or re-touching varnish mix one ounce of gum-mastic with half an ounce of hut oil and quarter of an ounce of spirit of turpentine dissolved in the same manner as in mengs mastic varnish virnishes for preserving paintings for this purpose some have recommended the fol- lowing composition viz half pound of guim san- darac an ounce and half of venice turpentine three quarters of an ounce of each of the gums anime and copal half an ounce of mastic benzoin gum elemi and white resin each two drachms and one pound of rectified spirit of wine the benzoin and gum anime powdered are put with the venice turpentine into phial with eight ounces of the spirit the copal and resin powdered are also put in phial with six ounces and the powdered gum elemi with two ounces of spirit of wine the seve- ral phials are frequenily shaken till the guins erc are dissolved then the solutions are strained through fine linen cloth into one bottle and when the mixture has stood some days it is decanted off clear and kept in separate boitle for use some have substituted sarcocolla for the copal another composition is formed by dissolving mas= tic and sandarac gressly powdered of each six ounces and venice turpentine half an ounce in quart of highly rectified spirit of wine and strain- ing off the solution if it be required harder an equal weight of the gums apime and copal may be added and the quantity of spirit of wine doubled in the use of this varmsb the painting should be thorgughly dry and it should be spread very gently with the pencil the varnish should be laid on in very wartn place or the picture irself warmed to moderate degree in order to prevent the chilling of the varnish in which case another coat should b added and indeed two or three coats are necessary to preserve the painting and to bring out due effect of its colors if they are in that state called sunk in occasioned by the attraction of the cloth on the oils mixed with them an oil of turpentine yarnish may be made by grossly powdering mastic and sandarac of each four ounces two ounces of white resin and sarcocolld anime copal and olibanum of each one ounce and putting them into phial with two pounds of oil of turpentine stopping the phial lightly and placing in any gentle heat so that the mass may not boil and straining off the solution for use or varmish more simple and equally good may be made by powdering two ounces of sandarac mastic and olibanum of each an ounce and half or three ounces of mastic and venice turpentine half an ounce and dissolving then in half pound of oil of turpentine and proceeding as before white varntshis usually made of guin sandarac and gun mastic dissolved in spirits left to settle two days then strained through linen cloth and after standing some time the clear poured off and bottled for use the more curious artists dissolve the two gums se- parately and having made separate varnish of each mix them occasionally as their work requires stiffer or softer varisb but for the best white varish more gums are re quired viz venice turpentine gum copal elems ben anune and white resin varnish for printsâ€”take four o it into small pieces boil it in quart of brandy or other strong spirit when it becomes the consistence of strong glue by being little ex- posed to the air it will answer the purpose with this glue while hot wash over the print as quick as possible and let that stand for day or so to dry well wash it over again in the same manner and afterwards brush it over at such distance from the fire that it may not blister do this also two or three times varnish it with white varnish and let it stand afterwards varnish it again if it should at any time be soiled by flies or the like you may wash it with sponge

choose first to count the cost it may perhaps obviate objections in the minds of some to observe how reasonable are the principal requisites for attempts in most branches of the arts we shall how

before we proceed to explain the use of colors and the materials for practice it may be proper to premise few observations as introductory to the ap- plication of them in general the more simply and distinctly colors are used the better they are not oply more easy to work but they are also brighter and more durable of colors produced by composition such as green and purple those tints which contain the fewest in- gredients are usually to be preferred some colors very necessary in painting in oil are entirely useless in water others of great service in water agree not with oil and some which in appear- ance promise well in other manners are found defi- cient in effect and durability when used in erther few colors are in their natural state fit for imme- diate use but must undergo previous preparation according to their texture or temperâ€”of these pre- parations the principal are washinc and grind- ins but some require calcination of washing colors colors are washed by being mixed with and etrongly stirred about in proper quantity of fair water till the water having dissolved them is tho- roughly colored by them if the sufface of the water appear greasy take off that scum then pour the colored water into clean bason leaving the grosser sediment behind the water thus poured off will in little time deposit quantity of color this operation may be repeated till the color obtain- ed is sufficiently pure which appears by its fineness and its prilliancy the use of vinegar of milk or of other liquids is occasionally adopted by some artists for certain colors of grinding colors colors are ground by means of large muller on flat stone this operation requires strength and care they are occasionally collected together as the mul- ler spreads them by means of large knife the oil or other vehicle with which they are ground being added as wanted in grinding colors the motion of the muller should not be too swift but gentle lest the color by being heated lose part of its lustre especially if it be color of no great body in grinding white observe to cease before it becomes greasy or dirty colors are liable to injury by being ground on stone not thoroughly cleaned from the color which preceded many persons who are curious grind their own at least the finer colors that they may depend on their purity the grinding of colors should be continued till they are capable of uniting so intimately with the wehicle they are compounded with as to seem only liquid of that color which is termed bearing body and those colors which permit this are al- ways most agreeable in using whereas some will not embody but are apt in working to separate and disperse this remark chiefly concerns colors in- tended for oil many of the best water colors are fit for use by being dissolved in gum water colors ground in oil can be used only in oil oil colors kept too long grow fat and become useless colors united with cunrs for the purpose of water colors will not readily mix with oil colors ground in spirits may be preserved after grinding and used either in oil or in water being capable of mixture with either ofcalciningcolors some colors require calcinatton to render them fit for use some are burnt merely by putting them in the fire till thoroughly red hot others are rather dried than burnt being placed in an iron ladle over the fire and kept there till the smoke they ennt ceases ivory is burnt between two cru- cibles well luted together and covered with coals of tempering water colors the colors being free from those impurities which are natural to them to temper them take small quantity of any color put it into clean shell or cup add to it few drops of guin water and incorporate them by working them about the shell let them dry and when dry touch the color with your finger if any of it comes off it requires stronger gum water if the color shines and glisters when dry the guin water was too strong and must be qualified by lowering it with fair water lways let it dry before you use it then having wetted it take proper quantity in your pencil transplace it on the pailet and mingle such colors as the subject requires gum wwater is made by dissolving quantity of sum arabic the clearer the better in fair water the strength of the gum water required must determine the proportien of the ingredients take quarter of an ounce or perhaps half the quantity of gun arabic and pour boiling water on it in tea- cup when dissolved it is fit for use little colo- quintida added to the solution will prevent flies from injuring the work if exposed the water with which colors are united is of more consequence than is generally imagined and unless limpid and pure contributes to their fading flake white used with water containing particles of iron soon becomes black and disagreeable to remedy this evil the curious use only distilled water which is easily obtained from common tea-kettle by condensing the steam which if the kettle be not too full of water may be done by binding round the spout cloth wetted in cold water or by the addition of tin spout to fit the kettle wetting and cooling the cloth occasionally there are mineral waters erc which produce very singular effects with sotie colors but beside the colors which require the use of guin water as above described there are several use- ful colors extracted chiefly from vegetables in the form of tinctures to obtain which the customary method is to boil the ingredients with the addition of alum in quantity of water till the water has ac- quired sufficient strength of color sometimes the nixture is boiled yet stronger and sometimes but not often the sediment of the mixture after boiling of use to use color in tincture generally called wwash color try first whether its strength be what your subject requires if it be too deep it may be lightened by the addition of fair water if too light it may be deepened by setting saucer of it to sim- mer over gentle fire till it acquires the strength desired the watery part may by this means be nearly or even totally evaporated red brazil wash for instance will hereby take solid form and afterwards work up pretty enough boby colors as they are called to distinguish them from washes may be ligbtened by being diluted with water but can not be deepened beyond the natural state of the original material to shadow which when used of its full color recourse must be had to darker color of similar species care should be taken to keep the drawing hat and free from sinkings lest the colors if thin should ruh to those parts and there make patches of darks ecc if the paper will not readily take the colors lirle fish-gall or ox-gall mingled among the colors will help them to prevent colors from sinking in take roch alum two

over with this solution while hot repeat it if wanted ofoil colors principal advantage of oil colors is that after they are dry they afford constant opportunity of being retouched or even changed either in whole or in part thus black may be re-colored white or brown blue but though this be undoubtedly great advantage yet it is only to be used when re- quired by necessity for the under color if allied to the superficial promotes both force and har- mony and it somstimes happens that if the under color be cold and powerful it tends to injure the tone of the upper oil colors are not in usual practice heightened by being diluted with oil as water colors are with water but by being mixed with any color or of lighter toneâ€”as light red upon dark cd yellow upon light red white upon yellow or simply white but if part should be beyond its due force it may be lowered by diluting some similar color with oil and as it glating it over till it is brought to the tone glazing is sometimes used on more im- or at least more extensive plan as when great richness is wanted in some particular color as criison cc after having painted and finished it as highly bright as he can the artist glazes it over with coat of lake sometimes this is repeated and the lights re-touched and instances have been where an artist has glazed bright white into crimson by means of carmine and lake erc glazing is best performed with colors naturally transparent such as lake cc but after all it is not applanded by those whose skill enables them to produce equal effects without this practice those painters who have attained nearest to just representation of nature have usually composed on their pallettes great number of tints related to the subject on which they were about to employ them and by mingling these tints they have approached nearer to truth than those who mingle the secondary colors of the pallette in their pencils and immediafely apply them to the cloth for by this latter manner mi vol ii edit yet is too common the colors are not only less incorporated but they are apt to become dull en and dirty the usual way of painting in oil is to lay on the colors with one pencil and then soften them into each other with clean tool this is terrhed scum= but whether scumbling be really beheficiar to picture is much doubted certainly where strength desired it may well be omitted as also in the edlo is obb is ed hd iho finishing touches pencil for each color is necessary where clean tints are desired the smell of oil colors would not be bad as it sometimes were the oil of the best quality colors are ranged on pallette beginning with white on the front then yellow cc according to the darkness of the color ending with black distemper colors colors incorporated with si are useful in works required to be free from glistening that they may be seen to advahtage in all stuations such as the scennts of theatre but they are not used for pictures of late fashion has introduced them into apartments all is lodnchar instead of wailiscotting ecc are likewise used in fresco-paintings in in warm countries but these are very rare in britain fresco-paintings are performed on the mortar of wall while wet and dry with it which circumstance totally prohibits the use of oil incorporation of colors with wax is very farely practised for the method of procedure vide encaustic of ranking colors colors are ranked as follows white feleow orange red purple blue black white and black are the extremes of color yellow is the color next to white then green then blue green is composed of mixture of yellow and blue of mixture of yellow and red purple of mixture of red and blue these compound colors admit an infinity of tints as they incline most to either of the primary colors of which they are com- pounded some persons divide colors into dark and light including among the first black umber bistre light colors white and those which ap- proach it is sine te riclll thus given some general hints on the nature of colors by way of introduction we proceed to nor fice more particularly the various manners of their applications of m coloring maps thecolors fittest for this purpose are those which are perfectly thin and flaid usually called wasb-colors or tinctures they should be diluted with water intimately mixed with them by their when the desired tint being well stirred together of color is thus obtained with brush proportioned to the size of the space intended to be stained briskly apply the wash always endeavouring to avoidâ€” all passing over the proper limits of that color all rannings of the color into spots or parts of deeper tint than the rest occasioned by the settling of greater quantity of color in some places than in others or sometimes if one part of the space be dry before the rest by second coat of color passing over it begin the boundaries of your space first that you may not exceed them be careful that no two limits which touch each other are of the same color since the prime intent of this business is distinction distribute yourcolors if practicable so as to pro- duce pleasing effect in the whole after the various divisions are faintly washed the boundary lines should be very neatly colored with much stronger color of the same kind coloring prints in this business regard should always be had first to the paper on which the prints are printed if it sinks it may require the assistance of roch alum or other strengtheners the body of printing ink which remains on the surface of the paper should proportion in many cases the strength and consistence of the color to be used according to the effect required if it be intended only to stan the print the effect of the en- graving will be useful as forming shadows and as keeping the drawing.. if it be proposed to color the print highly as advancing towards picture the engraving although it must be attended to as the regulator and guide of form and of effect yet may be concealed by surface of color ouit white color wherever you can do without it in the lights or parts approaching to lights let the thipness of color supersede the admission of white omit black color on the same principle if you can not do entirely without it take especial care to use as little as possible that it be not heavy in the broad lights rather mingle colors of nearly similar tone to produce the effect required than admit white the same principle adopt in the shades take great care that the outlines of all objects are mellowed sweetened and softened and hnerther sudden nor rugged nor cutting to the eye sometimes print may be washed and afterwards finished with body colors to good effect farmony and tenderness of color should alwaysbe much attended to then distribution and

remembered glaring colors are purtful the best way for slight drawings is to procure an effect with the indian ink and then brilliancy and variety of tone ecc with colors flesh colors should be very

directions for laying on the different colors before you begin have all your cofors ready before you pallette for the conveniency of mixing them paper to lay under your hand to keep your work clean as well as to try your colors on also large soft brush or fitch to wipe off the dust when your colors are dry lay your colors on very thinly at first decpening them and mellowing them by degrees as you see occasion the quicker you lay them on the evener and cleaner your drawing will appear take care to preserve all your colors from dust and before you use them wipe your shells and pat lette every time with your fitch when you have done your work or would lay it aside be careful to wash out your pencils in clean waril water for face-painting mix up carnation or ffesh color with gum-water in

you may easily lower it but you can not rea- diay heighten it for the cheeks and lips use mixture of lake and red lead or carmine as occasion requires and fof blue tints as under the eyes and in the veins indigo or ultramarine and white in coloring landscapes at first only lay dead co- lors smooth all over the piece leaving no part un= covered use masterly freedom and the work though seemingly rough at first will have good effect when finished let not the roughness of the color dis=ourage you it is easy to soften it by degrees with the other shadows observing only to sweeten and heighten them according as the light falls in some places lay on strong touches and in those places bring your work up together to an equal strength tempering and sweetening your colors with sharper pencil than the first that no lumps or harsh edges be left but that all your shadows may be soft and smooth and gliding gently as it were into one another you are not to finish any part before another but work up all the parts gradually alike that you may judge of their effect on each other and on the whole n laid your dead colors begin first with the distances and lighter parts as the sky sun-bearns eic then the yellowish beams which are to be done with indsticot and white next the blue of the sky with ultramarine bice or smalt alone making jour colors deeper as you rise upwards from the hori- except in tempestuolis skies the tops of distant mountains must be worked so faint that they ay seem to lose themselves in air all distant objects imust be made imperfect as they appear in natiure and all distances must be finished with colors laid as thin of in as small quantities as possible your colors forward as you advance to the maif front till you come to the fore-ground itself where you may employ not only stronger colors but greater quantity of them and in bolder manner in coloring trees boughs and branches touch in all the dark shades first raising the lighter leaves apove the darker the uppermost of all are to be done last tough lightly the extremities of the leaves and set off the darkest shadows with sap-green and indigo or other strong colors the intentofevery picture is to imitate nature therefore where nature indicates different compo- sitions of colors from what we have given above seoce compose them as fear as possible if you fail at first you may sacceed afterwards it is not to be sup- posed that the real effect of colors in combination can he understood or attained till after the hand and the eye are inatured by practice and re-consideration of painting in mintature painting in minlature has many advantages over other branches of art it is nearer and not so incumbered with materials as you may easily take with you all that are necessary and entertain your- self wherever you please quit and resume it when you will without such variety of preparations as are necessary in oil coloring the colors are those used for water colors they- must be of the best quality finely ground cleanly erc and mixed in the shells with gum water must be reserved in phial kept corked and observe never to take any out with pencil that has color on it but with quill cut for the purpose in the form of scoop to know whether yourcolors are properlygunmed draw your pencil when filled with color on your hand which dries immediately and should you per- ceive that it cracks or shines it is then too highly gummed but if it rub off by lightly passing your finger over it on your hand it has too little gum in it and must have an addition put into the shell tak- ing care not to use too much gum which makes they color hard gum adds strength to dark colors and when you choose to give greater force to any color than it naturally bears increase the quantity of sum to correct the greasiness of dark colors mix little of the gall of an ox carp or cel particularly latter dried and dilured with brandy for use this makes the color work free and prevents its scaling ivory is generally used to receive the colors but card is very useful and may be sufficient for slight subjects the choice of good pencils is great matter therefore wet them little as you draw them through your lips and if the hairs keep close together as you turn them on the back of your hand and make but one point they are fit for use but if they make several points some longer than others they are use- when they are too sharp pointed with only few hairs longer than the others they must be trim- ined with pair of scissars taking care not to clip dway too much it is necessary to have different sizes the larger for laying grounds and dead coior ing and the smaller for dotting and finishing to bring the hairs of your pencil to join close together and make fine point just put it between your lips moistening and pressing it leaving only so much color on it as is sufficient to give fine and equal touches none of the colors used in miniature painting are porsonous of prejudicial except king' yellow and orpiient which are seldom or never used this method is particularly used for dotting and finishing the naked parts of picture that the touches may be neat and not too much charged with color as for draperies and other large masses it to draw the pencil over the edge of the shell to unload it giving few strokes upon card or paper before you use it on the picture the north light as desirable for the painting-roomi as by that light we view objects most truly and with- out glare it is necessary to admit the light at one window only and that confined to your work placing your left side next it and your desk on just high enough to wark at in an easy and graceful manner without stooping or crampness which is very detrimental to health sketch the outlines of the picture with thin car- mine this being finished proceed to dead color making the shadows tender that they may afterwards be heightened by dotting and brought to proper color and spirit there are several methods of dotting and every painter has that peculiar to himself some make their dots perfectly round others make them long but the best and most expeditious manner is by little strokes that cross each other every way till the work appears as if it had been dotted softening them so as to give your picture fleshymellowness and avoid ing all dry or hard touches after you have dead-colored

with vermition and car mine giving the strongest touches at the corners of the eyes next the hose under the nose the ears and inder the chin the fingiis and in every part where you would mark out separations in shades that are obscure next lay in the blueish tints with indigo on such parts as go off or turn from the light as the temples under and in the corners of the eyes on both sides of the mouth little on the middle of the forehead between the nose and eyes on the side of the checks the heck and such other parts as nature indicates fellow tints are composed of ochre and vermilion and are given on the sides of the nose towards the bottom under the eye-brows little underneath the checks and on the other parts which rise and come forward to the sight it is particularly in these tints the complexion is to be observed vhen you have done your dead-coloring and laid in the several tints proceed to finish by dotting over the shadows with greenish tints and finishing the yellowish and blueish tints before directed soften the extremity of your shades on the light sides pre= serving the color of the vory for middle tint which adds fine sofiness to picture finish your strong shadows with bisfre and vermition or terra di siennd and in some parts with pure bistre according to the subject you are painting laying on your colors as clear as possible dot the clear and bright parts with

completed the head of portrait which being drawn from nature possesses in conse- quence considerable degree of truth and force that the picture is finished and their work is done whereas much of the grace of the picture and very much of the general effect of it depends on the addition of accessaries which are to complete its these if well disposed and apply suited to the main subject not only embellish that subject but confirm and invigorate its effects by imparting splendor and brilliancy throughout the whole â€” whereas if unsuitable and unfit they enfeeble what has been already well done and spoil that which in itself had spirit â€”in short for these also consult nature craygndrawings the following article will furnish much informa- tion in the manner of using crayons which may with propriety be adopted in drawings intended afterwards to be finished with chalks to that article therefore we refer as illustrating the present the procedure in this instance is by preparing the masses of light and shade with crayons either lightly touched with the finger or more accurately defined with stump according to the size of the subject the drawing being thus inserted in proper colors the chalks chiefly red and black are very neatly stippled into every speck or interstice agree- ably to the color of the part using red chalk where the flesh inclines to red and black chalk in the shalows or in the parts inclining to blne ec in working some subjects it is good way to scrape little powder off each crayon that may be requisite and to lay the several listle heaps of color in order on white paper then the outlines being dreviously drawn with small rolls of paper carefully made rub in the colors and finish with chalks stumps made of kid-leather gloves if not soiled in that part serve very well rolled up tightly will answer the purpose yet better some use stubbed camel'-hair pencils several crayons made of earths when thoroughly dried then gradually warmed or rather heared and dipped into linseed oil till saturated may be shar= pened to very fine point and the lines drawn by them will not be injured without violence perhaps by judicious experiments complete set might be cemposed of of crayons the perfection of crayons consists much in their being kindly tempered for it is impossible to exe- cute brilliant pieture with them if they are not on which account great care should be used in forming them to prevent their being hard we have al- ready forbid white lead in their composition because it will certainly turn black which white chalk tobacco-pipe clay or whiting well washed will ot do whether painter works with oil colors water colors or crayons the grand object of his pursuit is still the sameâ€” just imitation of nature but each species has its peculiar rules and methods painting with crayons requires in many respects treatment different from painting in oil because colors used dry are generally warmer than when wet with oil the proper paper for crayons is strong daper it either brown or blue the thicker the better if not t coarse and knotty the knots should be levelled with pen-knife or by hard rubbing then pasts the paper very smooth on linen cloth previously strained but some artists reckon it most eli- gible to delay pasting the paper till the subject is dead-colored.. the method of doing this is by laying the paper thus dead-colored on its face on smooth table and pasting the back of the paper the frame with the strained cloth must then be laid on the pasted side of the paper after which turn the painted side uppermost and lay piece of clean paper on it to prevent injury this done it may be stroked gently with the hand by which means the air between the cloth and the paper will be forced out with box of crayons in the lap is the sitting most convenient posture to paint in the box made use of when the student paints should be about foot square having nine partitions in it in the upper corner on the left hand sup- posing the box in the lap place the black and grey crayons those being the most seldom used in the second partition the blues in the third the greens and browns in the first partition on the left hand of the second row the carmines lakes vermilions and all deep reds the yellows and orange in the middle and the pearl tints next as these last are of very delicate nature they must be kept very clean that the gradations of color may be easily distin guished in the lowest row let the first partition piece of fine linen rag to wipe the crayons with while they are using the second all the pure lake and vermition tints and the other partition may contain those tints which from their complex nature can not be classed with any of the former that part of the picture which is immediately painting should be rather below the face of the for if it be placed too high his arm will be fatigued the windows of the painting-room should be darkened at least to the height of six feet from the ground as before directed for miniature and the subject to be painted should be situated in such manner that the light may fall with every advantage progress progress of portrait sie features of the face being correctly drawn with chalks take crayon of pure carmine and carefully draw the nostril and edge of the nose hicxt the shadow then with the faintest carmine tint broadly lay in the highest light upon the nose and the forehead proceed gradually with secondr tint and the succeeding to the shadows which must be covered brilliant enriched with lake carmine and deep green this method will at first offensively strike the eye from its crude appearance but will be good foundation to produce pleasingieffect in finishing colors being much more easily sullied when too bright than raised to brilliancy the pearly tints of fine complexions must be imitated with blue verditer and white but if the parts of face where those tints appear are in shadow crayons composed of black and white must be substituted though all the face should be laid in as brilliant as possible yet each part should be kept in its proper relation of tone and of color to the others touch in the eyes with crayon inclined to the carmine tint brilliant not loaded with color but lightly incline the light of the eye- very much to blue cast cautiously avoiding staring white pre- seiving broad shadow occasioned by the eye-lash avoid heavy tint in the eye-brows treat them like broad glowing shadow on which afterwards the hairs of the brow are to be painted by which method the former tints will shew through and produce pleasing effect begin begin the lips with carmine and lake the streng vermilion tints should be inseried afterwards mark the corner of the mouth with carmine brown ochre greens intermixed if the hair is dark pre- serve much of lake and deep carmine therein this may be easily overpowered by the warmer hair hats which will produce rich effect when finished having dead-cofored the head sweeten the whole together by rubbing it over with the finger passed very lightly beginning at the strongest light on the forehead uniting it with the next tint and so off till the whole is sweetened together ofien wiping prevent sullying the colors be caus the finger frous not to shnoothen or sweeten picture too ofteny because it will produce rather the appearance of drawing than of painting to avoid this replenish the picture with crayon wherever and as often as necessary when the head is somewhat advanced let the back-ground be laid in which must be treated in different manner covering it as thin as possible near the face the paper should be almost free from colot for this will do the head great service by its thinness in the back-ground no crayon that has whiting in its composition should be used but chieffy such as are least adulterated the ground being thin next the hair will give an opportunity of painting the edges of the hair in light manner when finishing the face hair and back-ground being covered carefully view the whole at some distance remarking what f what parts are too light and what too dark being particularly atteative to white or chalky appears ances which must be subdired with lake and cakminnes the next step is to complete the back-ground and the hair because the dust in painting these will fall on the face and would much injure it if that was completed first from thence proceed to the fore- head finishing downward till the whole picture is cempleted in painting the forehead the last time begin with the faintest vermilion tint in the same place where the faint carmine was first laid keeping it broach in the next shade work in some light blue tints in= fermixing with them somewhat deeper vermition tints melting them into one anether some light yellows may also be used but sparingly toward the roots of the hair strong verditer tints intermised with greens will be of use pearly tints compesed of verditer and white are to be preserved beneath the eyes under the nose and on the temples be= heath the lips tints of this kind are proper mixing them with the light greens and vermition in finishing the checks let lake clear them from any dust contracted from the other crayons then with the lake intermix bright vermilion and last of all if the subject should require few touches of orange-eolored crayon but with extreme caution after this sweeten that part with the finger as little as pessible for fear of producing heavy effect.- the beauty of crayon picture consists ipn one color shewing itself through or rather between another beautiful this being the only method of imitating complexions to advantage the vol ii edit eye is the most difficult feature to execute in crayons as every part must be expressed with the utmost nicety to appear finished at the same time that painter must preserve its breadth while partn- cularising the parts to accomplish this it good general rule to use the crayon in sweetening as much and the finger as little as possible.when point to touch small part with is wanted break off little of crayon against the box which will pro- duce corner to dark eye-lashes use some of the carmine and brown ochre and the crayon of carmine and black and with these touch the irns of the eye if brown or hazel red tints of vermition car- sine and lake will execute the corners of the eye properly but if the eye-lids are too red they will have disagreeable appearance the pupil of the eye must be of lamp-black between this and the lower part of the irns the light will catch very strong yet it must not be made sudden but be gently dif- fused round the pupil till lost in shade when the cye-balls are sufficiently prepared the shining speck must be made with pure white crayon first broken to point and then laid on firm but if defective in neatness it may be corrected with pin by taking off the redundant parts the difficulty with respect to the nose is to pre- serve the lines properly determined at the same time so artfully blended into the check as to express its projection and yet no real line to be perceptible on close examination in some circumstances it should be quite blended with the check which appears be- hind it and determined entirely with slight touch of red chalk the shadow caused by the nose the darkest in the face partaking of no reflection from surrounding parts carmine and brown ochre carmine and black and such brilliant will compose it best prepared the lips with strong lake and carmine with these colors make them com- pletely correct and when finishing introduce ver- milions but with great caution as they are extremely predominant in coloring the neck preserve the stem of pearly hue and the light not so strong as on the chest if any part of the breast appears its transparency must be expressed by pearly tints but the upper part of the chest should be colored with beautiful vermis lions delicately blended it is evident that the foregoing principles are ap- plicable only to the finest complexions it would be absurd to treat the portrait of sea-officer with transparent blues and pearly tints variation of colors according to the subject is indispensable but such variety is not difficult to whoever reflects on what has been already hinted crayons usually appear to greatest advantage in the tender blendings of their tints in female countenances the warmer and bolder colors succeed best in oil we have been particular in noticing the places of the colors because the same rules apply in many other subjects and are drawn from nature itself p draperl an crayons dark blue purple black pink and all kind of red draperres should be first tinged with carmine which will render the colors more brilliant than any other method over this should be laid the middle iiht except the masses of dark shadow which may be laid on deep with the light and dark fints the smaller parts are to be made with freedom executing as much with the crayon and as little with the finger as pos- sible in each fold touching the last stroke with the crayon which stroke the finger must never touch in reflexions the simple touch of the crayon will be harsh therefore fingering will be necessary with respect to reflexions in general they must always of the same color as the object reflecting but in the case of single figures of whatever color the drapery is the reflexion on the face must partake thereof otherwise the picture like paintings on glass will have but gaudy effect linen lace fur should be touched spiritedly with the crayon fingering very little except the lat- ter and the last touches even of this should be executed by the crayon without sweetening with the finger the coat of crayons should be but thin on the shadows but in the lights body of color will con- tribute to force and to durability paintinc on glass or bace-painting this manner of painting is executed with great facility it gives all the softness that can be desired and is easy to work there are no outlines to draw nor shadows to insert but the colors are put on without the trouble of either the prints for this purpose are done in mezzotinto but many of those well-finished engraved in the manner of chalks are very proper fory their sha- dows being blended together when rubbed on the glass appear soft and united as drawings in indian ink from such prints cut off their margin then on piece of fine crown-glass very clean the size of the print and free from knots and scratches lay some vepnice turpentine on one side quite thin and smooth with painter brush lay the print flat in water when thoroughly wetted which requires four-and-twenty hours for some sorts of paper but other sorts are ready in two hours take it carefully out and lay it between dry papers that the super- fluous water may be absorbed next lay the damp print flat on table with its face uppermost then holding the glass over it without suffering the turpentine to touch it rill it is exactly even with the print gently press the glass down in several parts and turning it press the print with your fingers drawing them from the centre to the edges till every part is quite smooth and free from blisters this this done wet the back of your print with sponge till the paper will come off with your fingers then rub it gently and the white paper will roll off and leave behind it only the ink which formed the impression when dry with camels-hair pencil dipped in oil of turpentine wet it all over and it be transparent and fit for painting on sheet of white paper placed behind will contris bute to its transparency and assist in determining the coloring exc lay the lighter colors first on the light parts of your print and the darker over the shadows and having once laid on the brighter colors it is not ima- terial if the darker sorts are laid little over them for the first color will hide those laid on afterwards the glass when painted must stand three or four days to dry and be carefully covered from dust the proper colors are those used in oil for their management take the rules laid down in the follow- ing articles years ago the ingenious mr. vispre exhi- bited number of paintings on glass the subjects fruit flowers exc as in this kind of painting the lights must be first inserted the pictures are apt to suffer by coldness which is evident in the per- formances of those who are not perfect in the prin- ciples of their art this must be guarded against and care must be taken to give spirit to the pencil otherwise the smoothness of the glass will impart tameness to the picture generae articte colouring dictionary landon publishd by ctaylor hatton garden holborn jan general elements of painting in oil the predilection of many persons for pietures in miniature of in crayons there are scarce any who are not sensible of the superiority of oil pictures their more accurate coloring and their greater force as well as their services in subjects of considerable dimensions render them principal ob- of attention of the choths necessary for this kind of painting of the pencils tools pallette and pallette-knife see the respective articles in the compendium of colors to these urensils most painters add what they ty term mall-stick which is slender rod or stick at one end of which is tied ball of soft rag cotton ec to prevent bruising or hurting the pieture against which it rests this stick is held in the left hand and its use is to support the right hand while at work keeping it steady and firm but many artists who possess command and freedom of hand decline the mall-stick as bad custom easels are of various forms and contrivances but generally composed of three uprights orlegs the longest behind in the two which are in front are number of holes corresponding in height to their opposites in each leg so that when peg is placed in them whatever is laid on these pegs is kept even it is usual to place slight piece of board termed shelf on these pegs to support small pictures colors proper for painting in oil ase usually kept in the color shops in bladders at certain prices and this is the best method of purchasing small quans tities of them except ultramarine carmine and vermilion perhaps also the lakes and prussian blue which should be bought in powder as in that state they will be best preserved the least touch of these will give the picture cast mix up no more of these colors than you want for present use which must be with drop or two of nut-oil on the pallette with the pallene-knife to get the color out of the bladders prick hole in the side of each and press it till you have suffic cient for present use as what remains will dry and skih over and so become useless great variety of colors are used in oil the fols lowing is

ivory black bone black blve black flake white when pure is the very best white though it has not the body of nottingham lead this color should be ground with the finest poppy oil white is very friendly working color and comes forward with yellows and redsâ€”but retires with blues and greens it is the nature of whites to sink into whatever ground they are laid on there- fore they should be laid on white grounds to preserve their brilliancy or considerable body of the color should be laid on to allow for sinking in of nottingham lead there are two sorts the best is little inferior in

invented coler very bright and durableâ€”dries very well tellow lak should be used sparingly time will deprive it of its beauty unless it he well secured by varnishâ€”it is bad driey tellow ochre the best stone ochre is very difficult to procure genuine but the want of it may be supplied by sienna earth and nottingham white which will produce pretty much the same tint or rather brighter with this advantage that it is deeper in its tone with less of the lead in it the great body of the lead supporting the siennd earth which alone is semi-transparent red ochre is valuable color when prime and genuine for though cheap it is often to be had only of an inferior quality the best is that which is very hard and stony difficult to grind more difficult to procure in perfection this with little deep lake is not inferior to the best indian red in many effects that may be produced by it it is friendly mixing color of great useâ€”should be ground with put ail though lipnseed oil is commonly used for it light rep is fine light ochre burnt this mixes very agreeably with white and produces flesh color of great use fine red lead by an improved method of pusifying it is rendered very bright and stands well of of vermilton the true native cinnabar is by some artists reckoned the best it will not plate but is fine color when glazed it is ground with linseed oil and should be used with dryingoil pale or bright vermilion is esteemed much the most useful of the vermitions as the effects of the others may be produced with this and good lake but they can not equal the brightness of this by any mixture wharever indran red is strong pleasant working color but will not glaze well and when mixed with white falls little into the leadch tone it is ground and used as lake mixture of red ochre and lake is occasionally substitute for indian red nevertheless this is useful and powerful colorâ€”in- deed it is often rather too powerful and especially while wet in which state it differs from itself when dry experience alone can justly foresee its true effects lake is tender sympathising decpred but of no strong body therefore it should be strengthened with indian red it is the best glazing color it is ground with linseed oil and used with drying oil carmine is most beautiful crimson between lake and vermilion is fine working colot and glazes it should be ground with nut oil and used with drying oil brown ochre color allied to this may be made from yellow ochre and other mixtures of the ochres sienna sienna earth fine color but little in use except for landscape in which this color burnt is of considerable service sienna earth burnt mixed with dark yellow and indian red makes fine tint the best sort burnt mixed with white and little ultramarine makes an exquisite flesh color for skies cc antwerp brown this brown is not al ways kept in the color-shops we shall therefore give here the manner of preparing it it is valuable from its great depth of tone it has great body and will stand well being produced by fire.â€”put some good asphalrum into an iron ladle set it over very slow and feeble fire taking care it does not boil over keep it there till it will boil no more but is become nearly cinder when cold put to it the proportion of half an ounce of sugar of lead to half pound of the calx grind it in the strongest drying oil it will work free and dry well nv this operation is called burning of asphaltum asphaltum thus burnt i used in some compositions of etching ground- ttde cround brown pink is fine glazing color but of no strong body in the flesh it should never join or mix with the lights because this color and white are enemies and mix to warm dirty hue for which reason their joinings should be blended with cold middle tint in glazing of shadows it should be laid before the other colors that are to enrich it it is one of the finishing colors and therefore should never be used alone in the first painting it is strengthened with burnt umber and weakened with terra verte ground with linseed oil and used with drying oil better color in the opinion of some artists and more certain may be made from antwerp brown and patent yellow umeer burnt or unburnt is especially use- ful in dead-coloring it forms outlines ec well or washes in subject xc to advantage burnt umber is very quick drierâ€”is fine warm brown and good working strong color it is of great use in the hair and mixes finely with the warm shade it is highly commended by some artists and highly blamed by others as sullyingcolor ultramarine is the finest blue known in the world it stands even in the fire it is tender glazes beautifully and never glaresâ€”it is retiring color from its great value should be used with the purest oils prusstan blue is fine blue and kind working color but apt to be cold and rarely or never stands well it should be ground in nut oil as grosser oils injure ir should only be ground as wanted lamp-elack is troublesome color and should be burnt in an iron box till red hot being greasy color and when mixed with the strongest drying oil still requiring the assistance of little sugar of lead to force it to dry ivory black is far preferable to lamp-black as it mixes much berter with other colors it is good shade for deep blue ivory black and little indian red make good general shadow colot it is eround with linseed oil and requires the assistance drying oil black is in its nature cold and tes tiring color except where by the force of contrast if comes forward in which case it has great power to set palette quantity of color being squeezed out of its blads ler on the centre of the pallette work it into proper form with the addition of what oil is requi= sitel by the pallette-knife and transplace it into its station on the upper part of the pallette beginning with the lighter color placed next the hand from these originals compose row of secondary tints by mixing them together in such proportion as appears most likely to suit the subject to be treated third row still nearer to the subject may easily be formed from the former to be somewhat more particular we suppose the original colors placed in their order on the upper part of the pallette to compose second row of colors take for example lake and naples yellow to these we imagine white to be added this compos sition we place in the second row and so of the rest if we wish for lighter tint of the same colors this produced by an addition of white or perhape we want red somewhat different varying to light red of to vermition these united form compound admitted lower on the pallette or the secondary color instead of red requires yellow or different kind of yellow or in short any other coler which ay be departure from the first mixture this combination is termed breaking the colors its use is prevent glare and rawness and its judicious exercise is principal token of masterly hand nature never presents pure unmized strong color of any cast but every color has an inclination to of tinge of some other blue sky seems at first an exception yet it is not so in fact nor the color of the sed nor the green of field for an in- humerable variety of lights reflexes exc are perpe- jually playing upon it and thereby diversifying debasing and confusing the original color even draperies vary in the colors of their lights and shades the yellow light of the sun the red light of fire white light cc alter their appearances and the deprivation of light in the shades as the parts are more or less retired is too obvious to need expla- nation yet even shadows are altered by reflexions from their neighbours it is evident from this mode of reasoning that to set pallette well requires no meak skill and per- haps if those who consider it as labour lost were to bestow more attention on it their pictures would not fare the worse for it we shall therefore give variety of modes as practised by the best masters method of setting the pallette as used by chevalier menss and others the principal light of fiesh is composed of white and naples yellow or light ochre or brown ochre according to the complexion of the person of these form the first and second tints white light red with little yellow the same little darkes for middle tint white black and yellow tempered with bittle red. the same little darker for shadorws tellow black with little red in three de- grees of strength in all these shadow tints little asphaltum may be used in order to give transpa- rency and an harmony for warm tint naples yellow and lake lake and vermilion lake and light red lake and terra de sienna burnt little asphaltum must be used in all these warm tints likewise make two other tints composed of black and white onlyâ€”and two other tints of purplish hue which are composed by mixing little vermis lion with the black and white another method of setting the pallette light fellow ochre and white ditto the same little darker ditto light red little yellow ochre and white light light the same little darker for very fine complexion add little vermi- lion in the tints no and ditto vermilion and white is also necessary in the checks cc demi-tint the same as no with peach black second tint fellow and black in the dead little red third tint terra de siennd burnt yellow and black reffexion to no add yellow ochre and brown ochre dirto to no add lake and burnt ochre black lake burnt ochre and terrd de sienna in setting pallette it is good to observe to lay those colors near each other which harmonize for example first white then naples yellow next light yellow dark yellow light red vermillion terra de sicnnd burnt lake blue umber light and burnt and black also observe in mixing the tints on the pal- lette to place them under in like harmony begin- ning with the lightest of each and so placing those of the next degree of strength one beside the other of the principal tints for painting flesh made by mikture frgm the principae colors light red tinr of lightred and white it is the best conditioned of all colors for general ground for flesh with this color and the shade-tent we should make out the flesh like claro obscure or vol ii edit we should also remember that this color will grow darker because it is naturally too strong for the white therefore we should temper it ii ehs by mixing some vermilion and white with it in pro- portion to the fairness of the complexion and though thus mixed it may yet be called the light red tint to avoid confounding the vermition tint with it vermilion tint vermilion and white mix ed to middle tint it is the most brilliant light red agrees best with the white light red and yellow tints carmine tint is carmine and white mixed to middle tint it is the most beautiful red for the cheeks and lips it is finishing color and should never be used in the first painting rose tint made of the red shade and white mixed to middle degree or lighter it is one of the cleanest and most delicate tints used in flesh for up the heavy dirty colors and therefore clearing in changing will sympathize and mix kindly tellow tint is often made of naples yellow and white or of light ochre and whice which is good working color remember the ochre is too strong for the white therefore it re- quires little allowance in using it it follows the light red tints and should always be laid before the blues if we lay too much of it we may recover the ground it was laid on with the light red tints blue tint ultramarine and white it is pleasant working color with it we should blend the gradations it follows the yellows and with them miakes greens and with the red it produces pur- ples no color is so proper for blending down or softening the lights into keeping lead tint ivory black and fine white mixed to middle degree it is fine retiring color is of great use in the gradations and in the eyes green tint is made of prussian blue light ochre and white this color will dirty the lights and should be laid sparingly in the middle tints it most used in the red shadows where they are too strong it is of dirty anripathizing nature shade tiwr is made of lake indian red black and whire mixed to murrey color of mid- dle int this is the best color for the general ground of shadows therefore called the shade-fint it mixes with the lights and produces pleasant clean co- lor little inclined to the reddish pearl as the four colors of its composition are of sympathising tiature this mixture will be the same and therefore may be easily changed by the addition of other color red shade is lake and very little indian red it is good working color and good glazer it strengthens the shadows on the shade-tint and receives when it is wet the green and blue tints agreeably it is good ground for all dark-shadows warm shade is made of lake and brown pink mixed to middle degree it is fine color for strengthening the shadows on the shade-tint when they are wet or dry we must take care that it does not touch the lights because they will mix with it to dirry snuff-color and therefore should be softened with tender cold tint r dark dark shade is made of ivory black and little indian red only this color mixes very kindly with the red shade and sympathizes agreeably with the middle tints in the dead-coloring it is glazing color for the eye-brows and darkest shadows it is an excellent shadow-color and one of the finest working colors first painting the colors and tints necessary for the first painting of flesh fine white light ochreâ€”and its two tints light redâ€”and its two tints vermilionâ€”and its tint tipt made of lake vermilion and white rose tint blve tint lead tint green tint half-shade tintâ€”made of indian red and white shade tint red shade warm shade finishing pallette for fine complexion re quires more viz carmine and its tint lake brown pihik ivory black and prussian blue the first lay of colors consists of two partsâ€”one the shadows only the other the lights the use of the shadows is to make out the drawing very correctly with the shade-tint as if it was to be done with this color only and remember to drive the color or lay it sparingly the lights lay in with the lightred tint in different degrees as in nature these two colors united produce clean tender middle int to go over the darkest shadows with the red of warm shade will finish the first lay the warm shade if laid on the shade-tint improves it to warther hue but if laid insread of the shade- tint it will dirty and spoil the colors it mixes with if the red shade be laid first instead of the shade- tint the shadows would appear too red and bloody the shade and light red tints are so friendly and delicate in their natures that they will not dirty each other though we are continually changing them to finish the first painting improve the reds and yellows to the complexion and after theim the blues that the blues on the reds make purple and the yellows green the same method is to be understood of the shadows but be sure to leave theim clean and not too dark therefore allowance should be made in their grounds with the light red because glazing will make them darker acloth of dark or bad hue requires strong body of color all over the shadows such as will not sink into the ground but appear warm and little lighter than the life that it may be of the same forwardness to finish as if it had been on light oround for the business of dead-coloring is that we leave i always in proper order for finishing the grounds of shadows in the dead-coloring should be such as will support the character of the finishing colors clean and little lighter than the finishing colors because the finishing of shadows consists in great degree of glazing all shadows and colors that are to be glazed should be done with colors of clean solid body because the glar- ing is then more lasting and has better effect the light red and white improved is proper for the first lay or ground which should be always done with full pencil of suff color brighter than the life because it will sink little in drying the greater the body and quantity of color and the stiffer it is laid the less it will sink every color in diying will sink and partake in proportion to its body of the color it is laid on all the lights of the flesh if not laid on light ground must consequently change little from the life supposing there is no allowance made the shade-tint for the shadows should verge upon the rose tint in proportion as the complexion delicate it is thought the great masters of coloring seldom sweetened or softened the colors but in uniting the first lay were very careful in preserving the brightness of their colors and therefore did not work them below the complexion the first painting should be left bright and bold and the less the colors are broken the better we should forbear using any colors that will prejudice them and te contented to add what is wanted in the next painting painting the second painting begins with laying on very small quantity of poppy oil then wipe it almost all off with dry piece of silk hankerchief leaving only moisture remaining from it the first lay of the second painting is scumbling the lights and glazing the shadows then finishing the complexion with the virgin tints and improving the likeness as far as we can without daubing scumbling is going over the lights where they are to be changed with the light red unts or some other of their own colors such as will always clear and improve the complexion with short stiff pencils scumbling only such parts as require it the light red tint improved is good color for scumbling and improving the complexion in gene= ral where the shadows and drawing are to be cor- rected employ the shade tint driving the color very stiff and bare the easier to retouch and change it with the finishing unts parts of the shadows should be glazed with some of the transparent shadow colors such as will improve them and come near to the life taking care not to lay on too much for fear of losing the hue of the first painting the ground of which should always appear through the glazing in umt- ing the lights and shades they should not mix dead and meally the more the lights mix with the shades the more meally those shades will appear go over the complexion with the virgin tints to improve the coloring to the utmost both in the lights and shadows this should be done in the same manner as we laid them in the latter part of the first painting with the reds yellows and blues blending them with delicate light touches of the tender middle tints without softening we should leave the tints and their grounds clean and disimct and be content to leave off while the work is safe and unsullied leaving what is required farther to the conclusion for in attempting the finishing touches before the colors are dry we lose the spirit and the drawing and dirty wherever we touch painting of fineshing it is now supposed the complexion wants little more than few light touches therefore there will be no occasion for ofling before we begin.. we begin with correcting all the glazings hrst where the glazing serves as ground or under part then we determine what should be done next before we do it that we may make the alteration with one stroke of the pencil thereby preserving both the glazins and the tints but if we can not lay such va= riety of unts and finishing colors as we intended it is better to leave off while the work is safe and in good order because those few touches which would the beauty of the coloring may easily be if we have patience to stay till the colors are dry and then add those finishings with free light strokes of the pencil it is much easier to soffen over sfrong tints when they are dry than when they are wet because we ay add the very colors that are wanting without endangering the parts that are dry if any of the colors of the pallette want to be changed to the life when we are painting it is better to do it with the knife on the pallette than with the pencil of back-groundss the principal colors necessary for painting back grounds in portraiture as walls buildings or the like are white black indian red light and brown ochre prussian blue and burnt umber from which the eight principal tinis are made as follows peael is made of black white and little indian red lead of black and white mixt to dark lead color teleow of brown ochre and white olive of lightochre prussian blue and whites flesh of indian red and white mixt to middle tints murrey of indian red white and little black mixt to kind of purple of middle tint stone of whice umber black and indianred dark-shade of black and indian red only here the lead tint serves for the blues the fiesh tint mixes agreeably with the lead the murrey i good blending color and of use where the olive is too strong the umber white and dark shade produce variety of stone colors the dark shade and umber used plentifully with drying oil make warm shadow color these colors may be laid ii edit with drying oil because they mix and set the better with the softener begin from the shadowed side of the head and paint the lights first then the gradations and sha- iir dows with large stuffish tool sparingly with the dark shade and white little changed with such colors as will give it the hue required but very nedr in regard to tone and strength leaving them like ne dark and warm shadows should be laid before the colors that join them with the dark shade and umber because if those colors were laid on first they would interrupt and spoil the transparency which is their greatest beauty the more the first lay is drove the easier and better we may change it with the finishing tints therefore we may lay them with the greater body as we heighten and finish the lights we do it with warmer colors accompanied with tender cold tints the lightest part of the ground is always hearest to the shadowed side of the head and this part governs all the rest it should be painted with variety of light warm clear colors which gradate and lose their strength imperceptibly we must take care not to cover too much of the first lay but consider it as the principal color when the lights are well adapted to support the head it is easy to introduce whatever kind of sha- dows we find most proper then soften and blend the whole the tints will sink and lose little of their strength and beauty in drying grounds walls cc may be finished at once painting or at terwards glazed with little of the dark shade and dryingoil drove very bare and their hue improved with few light touches of the color that is wanting the dark shadows may also be strengthened and im- proved by glazing after the subject is nearly finish- ed for fear of making them too strong curtains should be dead-colored when we paint the ground with clean colors of hue near to the intended curtain such will support the finishing colors with tender sort of keeping in regard to their tone in the lights but much softer in the sha- dows mixing and breaking the whole with the colors of the ground as fresnoy says bodies that are back in the ground should be painted with colors to those of the ground itsen if we can not set the folds the first painting we should leave the masses of light and shadow in regard to the keeping of the picture broad and well united together such may appear easy to finish on the colors of the landscape th back-grounds should be broken and softened with those of the parts which join them hereby bringing them into keeping so that the parts do not stare nor cut at their extremities the sky should be broke with the lead and the hesh tints the murrey tint is of great use in the grounds of distant objects the umber and dark shade in the near grounds the greens should be more beautiful than we intend them because they will and grow darker after all is painted we should go over the whole very lightly with the softener siar ic is painting deaperies the rightmethod of painting draperies in general is to make out the whole with three coloys oply the lights the middle rint and the shade tint the middle unt should be very near to the general hue of the drapery and the shade tint dark enough for the general hus of the shadows the lights should rather incline to warmish hue middle tint should be made of friendly working colors such as will mix of clean tender cool hue and the shade tint should be made of the same colors as the middle tint only with less light with these three colors we should make out the whole like me before we add any of the reflexions of finishing ints the refiexions of draperies cc are generally pro- ductions of their own and lighter than the shadows on which they are found being produced by light they will have light warm color mixed with the local color that receives them here it will be ne= cessary to observe the general method in managing the colors of the first lay and those of the reffexiopns and finishing tints in the first lay the high lights should be laid with plenty of suff color then shaped and softened into chgracter with the middle tint very correctly where the gradations of the lights are slow as in the parts it is proper to lay the middle tint first at their eatremities with tool that will drive the colery and leave it sparing because the lights will mix and hie the better upon it next make out all the shadows with the shade tint drove bare after this the middle tint which fills up and serves as kind of second lights and gradations should be ma- naged very nicely to produce character without touching any of the high lights which finish the irst lay reflexions and finishing tints are in general anti- pathies to the first lay they will without great care dirty the colors on which they are laid and there- fore should he laid with delicate light touch with- out softening if overdone it may be recovered with the proper color of the part either directly or when dry the color of the cloth is very improper for the ground of drapery we should change it with those colors which are most likely to improve and to support the finishing colers this method will preserve them in their greatest lustre in dead color- ing the lights and shades need only hint at the shape and roundings of the figure but if we have design to work from it will be proper to make all the large and principal parts in their places with clean color lighter than the intended drapery though in general of the same hue while the shadows are no darker than middle tint these should be mixed and broken in tender manner then softened with large tool that nothing rough or uneven be left to interrupt or burt the character of the finishing colors instances instances of particular kinds of drapery sattin all whites should be painted on white grounds laid with good body of color by reason this color sinks more into the ground than any other there are four degress of colors in the first lay to white sattin the fine white for the lights the first tint made of fine white and very little ivory black mixed to an exact middle degree be- tween the white and the middle tint this color follows the white and with this we should give the lights character taking care that this tint appear distinctly between the white and the middle tint the middle tint should be made of white black and little indian red mixt to beautnful clear color of pearly huc remember to allow for the red hue changing little toward lead color if there be occasion to make any part of the middle int lighter we should do it with the first tint only this color should also be laid sparingly before the white in the lights that happen in the middle tints and shadows on which we should lay the white with one light rouch not covering all the part made with the first tint but preserving softening edge or bor der between the white and the middle tint the shade tint should be made of the same color as the middle tint but with less white so that it be dark sough for the shadows in general with which we should make out the shadows into character in the reflexion and finishing tints of white sattins brown ochre mixed with the color of the lights is useful color in general for all reflexions pro- duced from their own colors accidental reflexions are made with the color of the parts from whence they are produced and the local colors that receive them two reflecting tints are wanted for draperies in ge= neral one lighter than the middle tint the other darker these may be changed on the pallette with the first and the middle tints as occasion requires or be lightly broken on the part that receives them but this last method is not so safe as the other the tint for blending the dark shadows to the mellow tender hue is made with the shade tint and little brown ochre laid on very sparingly with soft light touches for fear of making them heavy if it be over- done we may recover it with the color it was laid pon we often see little blue used in the first tint of white satfin when warm or dirty color is mixed with clean light one they will form dirty color it is the want of the red hue which makes white sat- tins often appear like pewter blue sattin blue sattin is made of prussian blue and fine white the best ground for blue is white for the lights and black and white for the shadows the first lay of colors for blue is divided into three degrees the the middle tint of beautiful arure coler for the lights about middle degree be ween that and white the shade tint dark enough for the shadows in general the broad should be lard with plenty of color and shaped to character with the middle tint before we lay on any other colors the less the colors are miked the better they will appear and stand for the lights of blue should be managed with as much care as those of white sattin next follows the rest ofthe middle unt and then the shadows the more we drive the shade tint the better it will receive the refiexions and finishing tints the shadows should be strengthened and blended with ivery black and some of their own color mixt into tender mellow hue the reflexions are made as those of white sattin with ochre and some of the lights which should be jane at ence the shadows when dry may be im- droved with the colors they were made of the prussian blue best to be used is that which looks the most beaunful before it is ground the soorner it after it is ground the better velvet may be painted at once the method is to make out the first lay with the middle tint and shade tint on which place the high lights with light touches and finish the shadows as those of sattin but the nearest imitation of velvet is procured by glazings having first prepared ground or dead coloring with such colors as will when dry bear out and support the glazing color the glazing color is of fine transparent quality used smply with oil only that whatever ground it is laid on the whole may he applar distinctly through it.. the best ground for blue is made with white and ivory black the white for the high lights which with the middle tint shade unt makes out the first lay like mezzo- tinto the middle unt should be lighter in propore to the grazing because that will make it darker it is often necessary to cover all but the high lights glazing laid with less quantity than if it was to be done once only if any of it touch the lights should wipe it off with clean rag the very high lights should be improved and made of fine and left to dry glazing color is prus- sian blue ground very fine with nut oil and should be laid with large stitlisn fool that will drive the color as occasion requires on the last glazing strengthen and finish the shadows we observe in this instance that glazing the middle tint which is made of black and white will not produce color so blue as if it had been pre- pared with prussian blue and white yet this color will preserve the beauty of the lights in their per- fection by reason of its tender obscure hue when the blueness of the other would diminish them this method of glazing blue is the general rule for all glazing the greatest fault in colofing draperies of any kind painting the shadowed parts with strong slarins tndliy colors which destroy the beauty of the lights this is not only the reverse of art but of nature whose beauty of color is always diminished in proportion to the light for this reason we should blend and soften the vol ii edit shadows with such friendly colofs as will agree with their local character and the requisite degree obscurity grazing blue the ughts may be glazed with owri ultramarine

excellent coloring depends scareef and crimson light vellow red made of light ochre lightred and white is the proper ground for scarlet the are indian red and in the darkest parts with very little black the secopnd painting should be lighter than we the finishing color to be in proportion to the glazing which will make it darker high lights are vermition for cloth and ver milion and white for gartin and relvet the middle is vermition with very litile lake or indian red the shade tint is indian red and lake with litile black in the darkest shadows the difference between scarlet and crimson is that the high lights crmson are whiter and the middle tint is made darker their reflexions are made with light red and vermition the high lights should be laid and ma- naged in the same manner as those of the blue for fear of dirtying them and sometimes they require to be touched over second time before we glaze them the more the colors of the second paintingare drove the easier and better they may be managed to cha- racter but the high lights should have good body of color and be left with delicate light touch after it is well dry we should finish by glazing the whole with fine lake and improve the reflexions and shadows scarler requires but very thin glazing it is better to glaze crimson twice over than to lay much at once painting pine colep are two different methods of painting pink re glazing the other by body of color one dy at one painting the same grounds do for both which should be whitish color inclining to yellow for the lights and indian red lake and white for the shadows the second painting for the glazing is done with the same colors and litile vermilion for the re- flexions and vermition and white for the high lights when dry glaze it with fine lake then break and soften the shadows into character and harmony directly the other method is to make the high lights with carmine and white the middle tint with lake white and little carmine and shadows with lake and indian red with little vermition for the reflexions but the shadows require to be broken with some tender obscure tint vellow the ground for yellow should be yellowish white for the lights and mixture of the ochres for the shadows there are the same number of tents in the yellow as in the white sattin the method of using them is the same the lights are made with king yellow ground with clean good drying oil the first tint i light ochre changed with little of the pearl tint made of the dark shade and white which should be laid and managed as the first tint in white sattin the middle tint is mixture of the light and brown ochre softened with the pearl fint the shade tint is made with brown pink and brown ochre these belong to the first lay the reflexions are light ochre sometimes in the warmest parts mixed with little light red the shadows are strengthened with brown pink and burnt miiiber.. the proper ground for green is light yellow made of light ochre little white and prus- blue for the lights and the ochres brown pink and prussian blue for the shadows the finest green for drapery is made of king' yellow prussian blue and brown pink the high lights are king yellow and very little prussian the middle tint has more prussian blue the shade tint is made with some of the middle tint brown pink and more prussian blue but the darkest shadows are brown pink and little prussian blue the lights and middle unt should be managed in the same manner as those of the blue sattin the shade tint should be kept entirely from the lights because the brown pink that is in it will in mixing dirty them as the black does those of the blues they dry little darker than they appear when wet the king yellow should be ground with good drying oil for the longer it is in drying the more it will change and grow darker and the soopner it is used ho pat better it will stand it is proper to have two the ggi of kings yenow one very light for the higa sare agon ths lights of

the mids dle tint because it has more of the general hue of the silk than any of the others the shade tint is of the same hue with the middle tint though dark enough for the shadows the high lights often very different from the middle tint should be of clean friendly working color that will in mixing with it produce tint of clean sympathizing hus the method of painting silks is to make out the folds with the chade unt and then fill them up in the lights with the middle tint this first lay should be done to satisfaction before any other colors are added the stiffer the middle tint is used the betier the high lights may be laid on it the reffected tint falls generally on the gradating half shades and should be laid with tender touches sparingly for fear of spoil- ing the first lay this method of painting answers to all the colored silks as well as changeable with this difference only that the plain colors require not so much art as the changeable do in matching the tints the last

and more lase and black of an equal quantity of lake and brown pink very litzie biack the method of painting black is very difterent from that of other colors for the principal thing in them is to leave the lights clean and brilliantâ€”but in black it is to keep the sbadows clear and transpa- therefore we should begin with the shade int and glaze over all the shadows with it nisi in the darkest shadows with black and litile of the shade tint very correctly after that fill up the whole breadth of lights with the middle tint only allwhich should be done exactly to the character the drapery and then finish with the high lights here observe that the ground being red will beap out and support the reds which are used in the finishing colors the lake in the lights takes off the cold huc if the shade tint was of any other color than transparent warm hie the shadows would consequently be black and heavy because no other equally with lake and brown pink can pres is wanting in the serve the warm briflancy of the black black is of cold heavs d always too strong for any other color there- it requires an allowaice in using it there will be few reflexions in sattin which should be added as those of other colors they should be made of strong colors such as burnt umber or brown ochre with little of the shade tint though these grounds mentioned for draperies are necessary for the principal and nearest figures in picture for portrait or the like yet figures placed deeper in the picture and such as are behind the or front figures should always be fainter in the tints of their grounds in proportion to their local finishing colors and their just effects colors used in painting linen are the same as those in white sattin except the first tint which is made of white and ultramarine ashes instead of the black mixt to very light blucish tint in the dead coloring care should be taken that the grounds be laid white and broad in the lights the shadows are composed of black white and little indian red like the middle fint of white sattin these should be left very light and clean to support the finishing colors in the second painting the lights are glazed with stiff pencil and fine white only drove bare with oil little oil the shadows scumbled with pop pp and some of the color they were made of the middle tint of white sattifi is the best color for the general int of the shadows wich this and white in different degrees make out all the parts to their character with free light touches without softening then with large long pointed pencil and fine white lay the high lights very nicely at touch after this the fine light blucish tint mixed light is laid in the tender gradations very sparingly and lightly without filling them up the first lay should be left clear and distinct the more it appears the better it is the overmixing and jumbling all the colors together which spoils the beauty of the character therefore it is better to let it dry before we add the reflexions and finishing tints this inethod of letting the beautiful cledr colors dry before we add the warm reflecting and har monizing tints prevents them from mixing with and dirtying each other the principal blending colors used in the reflexions are the yellow tint green unt and rose tint which last is made of lake indian red and whice the dead coloring should be as white as we intend the finishing colors to be by reason they will sink little in proportion to the color of the cloth which the glazing with pure white only will recover ii edit painting landscapes in oil principal colors used in

lights and leaving no part of the sha= dows so dark as we intend the first lay or dead colors which is to be lighter than the finishing colors though the foliage of the trees only rubbed in with faint sort of scumbling yet the trunks and bodies should be in their proper shapes with their breadths of light and shadow buildings should be done in the same nanner leaving the color of the cloth for their lights the figures on the fore-ground ofthey are determined should also be skerched in the same piethod and then the whale leff to dry of dead coloring let the first lay or dead coloring be without any bright glaring or strong dark colors so that the effcet is made more to receive and preserve the finishing colors than to shew them in the first painting the sky should be done first then the distances working downward to the middle group from that to the fore-ground and to the nearest parts all parts of each group as trees buildings should be painted with the group they belong to the art in dead coloring is to find the two colors which serve for the ground of the shadows in general the sky excepted and the method of using them with the lighrs the first of which is the dark shade with litile lake in it the other is burnt umber these should be changed little to the naiural hue of the objects and then laid and drove with drying oil in the same manner as we shade with indian ink which scumbling kind of glazing and as such they should be left otherwise they will be dark and heavy and would be epurely spoiled for the finishing glaz= ing both these colors mix and sympathize agreeably with the lights but should be laid before them when the landscape is designed begin with the sky which should be laid with good body of colors and left with faint resemblance of the prin= cipal clouds more in the manner of claro obscuro than with finishing colors the whiter it is left the better it will bear out and support them the dis= aces should be made out faint and uncertainly with the dark shade and some of their lights in different degrees and laid so as best to find and shew their principal parrs advancing into the middle group we introduce by degrees the burnt umber in the shades all the grounds of the trees being laid or rubbed in enough only to suggest an idea of their shapes and shadows faintly the grounds of their shadows must be clean and lighter than their finish- ing colors such as will support their character and seem easy to finish on in painting the lights it is better to incline more to the middle unt than to the high lights and to leave them with sufficient body of clean colors which will receive and preserve the finishing colors the better which may be done with few tints second painting begin with the sky lay in the azure and colors of the horizon then soften them after that lay in the general unt of the clouds and finish on it with the high lights and the other tints that are wanting light tender touches then soften the whole very lightly the finishing of the sky should be done at once painting because the tender character of the clouds will not match so well when dry as when the whole is wet the stiffer the azure and colors of the horizon are laid the better the clouds may be painted upon them the greatest distances are chiefly made with the color of the sky as they grow nearer and darker flaze and scumble the parts very thin with such glazing shadow colors as come nearest to the gene- ral hue of the group the objects are in so that the first painting or dead color should be seen through its on this add the finishing colors `` if this plazed ground be properly adapted to the object and place it will be easy to find the colors which are wanted for the lights and for the finish that we may not spoil the glazing we should be very exact in making those colors on the pallette and in laying them with light free touches here it may be proper to say samething of the most useful glazing colors lake terra-vert prussian blue and brown pink are the four principal the more they are managed like indian ink and the more distinctly they are left the better their transparent beauty will stand and appear after these burnt umber is good glazing warm brown used in the broken grounds and hearest parts but the most agreeable color for the darkest shadows is the dark shade improved with lake drove with drying oil it mixes harmonniously with the lights the shadows the trunks and the bodies of trees and the buildings the ground of the objects should be made out with such glazing shadow colors as seem nearest to the natural hue of the object in that situation and as the principal glazing colots themselves are often too strong and glaring they should be little softens ed by such colors as are near to themselves and the objects thus if in the distances the terra-vert and azure which are their principal glazing colors may pe improved and made lighter with some of the sky fhees and as the distances come nearer with the purple as we get more into the middle group the terra-vert and prussian blue may be varied with some of the green tints made without white for white is the destruction of all glazing colors as we approych the first group there is less occasion for changing them but the fore-ground and its objects require all the strength and force of glazing which the coleys are capable of producing after this glazing ground we should follow with strengthening the same in the shadows and darkest places in such manner as will seem easy to finish the colors that come next for finishing are in the degree of middle tints these should be carefully lant over the greatest breadth of lights in such manner as not to spoil and cover too much of the glazing with good body of color as stiff as the pencil can agreeably manage to character the colers of the unt should be clean and buannfal finmshing all the second painting downward from the sky through the middle group at the firsi group all objects should appear perfectly finished then under or distant parts should be finished before any of the other which are nearer down to the last and hearest objects of the pieture where it happens that painting one tree over another does not please forbear the second until the firstis dry thin near atfat trees of different colors will dobsucr af we let the under parts dry before we add the finishing colors the thirs anb last faintinc ifoiling be necessary lay the least quantity that can be with stump tool or pencil proportioned to the place that is to be oiled then wipe the place that is diled with silk handkerchief leaving no more oil than is proper for the purpose when finishing any objects we should use great variety of tints all nearly the same color but most of all when finishing trees as this gives richness to the coloring and contributes to produce harmony as the greens will fade and grow darker it is neces- sary to improve and in some degree to force them by making an allowance in using them so much the lighter the same reasonn applies to the glazing which if over loaded will be dull and heavy and consequently will grow darker the method for painting near trees is to make the first lay very ear to nature though not quice so hark and to follow it with strengthening the shadows then the middle tints and last of all lay the high lights and finishing colors but all this can not be done as it should be at once painting the best way is to do no more than the first lay with the faint shadows and leave it to dry then improve the uddle tints and shadows and let them dry the conclusion is adding all the lights and finish ing colors in the best -manner this method of leaving the first and second part to dry separately not only makes the whole easier and thore agreeable but leaves the colors in the greater perfection because because most of the work may be done with scums bling and glazing and some parts without oiling the lights also may be laid with better body of color which will not be mixed and spoiled with the wet ground what is said of trees answers to all kinds of shrubs and bushes the figures in landscape are the last work of the picture those in the fore-ground should be done before those in the distances the shadows of the figures should be of the same hue or color with those of the group or place wherein they are picture is generally intended to be viewed at distance the artist should frequently consider his performance at or near similar situation since whatever loses its effect at that distance however executed is labour lost the shadows if large may approximate nearly to the same tone according to their situations and may he thin of color but the lights should be distinct bold spirited and will not suffer even if loaded with color on the contrary it will contribute to durability to use only one fint to one color promotes clean- hess and freshness of the colors too much mixing and injures them teint different from what are on the pallette is wanted while at work on preture it is better to the colors proper to compose it on the pai lette with the knife than with pencil there is in somie persons strange predifection for smgoth pictures in oil this however is far from being ii edit meritorious unless picture be very small but in larger pieces bold and free pencil shews to advantage especially in the lights in the smart touches and firm markings and drawing in general colors look more brilliant while wet with oil than when they are dry little observa- tion will accustom the student to this circumstance it is usually the too great quantity of oil espe- cially of the grosser kinds which occasions the decay of the colors and it is observable that pic tures generally begin to fade in the darker parts and in the glazings where the color is thin the lights ingiitaining themselves long after those colors are obliterated color can not have worse property than that of tardy dryer as it holds what dust unavoidably falls on it and consequently sullies the beauty of the fints some artists aware of the bad qualities of the oils in use make too free with turpentine to work thin but this not only leaves the picture dead but carries off part of the force in evaporation to know when an oil pieture is dry breathe firmly upon it if it take the breath it is safe is proper to let the first coat of color be thoroughly dry before second is applied this should be care- fully attended to in winter the pencils when done with should be cleaned by spirits or oil of turpentine or if meant to be laid by for time they may be washed with soap the pallette should be constantly cleaned cleaning of pictures water is the first material and of the most general use in cleaning pictures this will remove many kinds of glutinous bodies and foulnesses such as sugar honey glue and many others and it will also take off any varnish of guim arabic glair of eggs or isinglass and is therefore the greatest instrument in this work it may be used without any caution with respect to the colors as it will not in the least affect the oil which holds them together olive oil or butter though not generally applied to this purpose through an ignorance of their effi- cacy will remove many of those spots or foulnesses which resist even soap as they will dissolve or cor- rode pitch rosin and similar bodies and they may be used very freely not having the least effect on the oil of the painting nor the dangerous effects of spirit of wine and oil of turpentine wood ashes or what will better answer the pur- pose when used in proper proportion pearl ashes being melted in water make proper dissolvent for most kinds of matter which foul paintings but they must be used with great discretion as they will touch of corrode the oil of the painting if there be no varnishing guin or resin over it by very little rub- bing the use of them or scope is however in many cases unavoidable and in general they are the only things employed for this purpose spirit of wine as it will dissolve all the gums and gum resins except guin arabic is very necessary for f the taking off from pictures varnishes composed of such substances but it corrodes also the oil of paintings and softens them in such manner as to render all rubbing dangerous while they are under its influence oil of turpentine will dissolve likewise some of the gums used for varnish but spirits of wine will in general much better answer the purpose there are however sometimes spots of foulness which will gave way to the spirit of turpentine but resist most other substances used for this purpose it may therefore be tried where every thing else appears to fail but even then very sparingly and with great caution as it will very soon act even on the dry off of the painting essence of lemons is of the same dangerous tenr dency with oil of turpentine but is much stronger dissolvent and should therefore only be used in the most desperate cases where spots seem indelible by all other methods spirit of lavender and rosemary and other essenrial oils have the same dissolving qualities as essence of lemons but they are in general dearer and some of them too powerful to be trusted near the colors when paintings appear to have been varnished with those substances that will not dissolve in water which is seldom done by painters who are acquaintr ed with the present practice as they destroy the more delicate tints and touches of the painting they are however very easily and safely removed by the following method of place place your picture or painting in an horizontal situation and moisten or rather ffood by means of sponge the surface of it with very strong rectified spirits of wine but all rubbing beyond what is ne- cessary must be avoided keep the painting moist by adding fresh quantities of the spirit for some minutes then flood the surface copiously with cold water with which the spirit and such part of the varnish as it has dissolved may be washed off but in this state of it all frietion and the slightest vio- lence to the surface of the painting would be very detrimental when the painting is dry this opera- tion may be repeated at discretion until the whole of the varnish is taken off to prepare the pearl and wood ash ley used in gleaning pictures let an ounce be dissolved in of water to be stirred frequently for half day then to be decanted from the settlings this mixture is said to epliven the brazil wwash to make stronger ley of the same let two pounds of wood-ashes and three quarts of water be managed as just directed and evaporated or even boiled to one quart or less quantity as you find it acrid to your taste strong ley is made by pouring hot water on quantity of ashes and when it has filtered through them collect it for use.â€” these leys are to be used warm with sponge and with the caution just directed when thick spots are nnot easily removed strong soap-lather may te of use not suffering it to touch any other part of the pieture but the spot it is to be engaged with for for using spirits of wine and other dissolvents the picture is to be laid on table and flooded with the liquor or well dabbed with sponge so as to keep the picture very morst add fresh ley as wanted then with cold water wash off the whole all dissolvents must be washed off with plenty of water and should it be necessary to use any of them again take care that the painting is quite dry this must be attended to at every repetition all spots ec of dirt are attached to picture either before it is varnished or during its being varnished in which case they dry with the varnish of after the varnish is dry if the latter plenty of warm water generally succeeds but if it be damaged while varnishing or before that operation the coat of varnish must be removed then the spot cleaned and the whole picture be re-vaynished it appears from this observation that it is of consequence to set pictures while drying in place free from dust cc since whatever dries with the colors can not be removed it sometimes happens that picture grows dull and obscure and it may be necessary to revarnish it this may be very safely done after inspecting whether the first varnish be clean transperring pictures the art of removing paintings in oil from the cloths on which they are originally done and trans- ferring them to new ones is of great use the me- thod is as follows let the decayed picture be cleansed of all grease that may be on its surface by rubbing it very gently with crum of stale bread and then wiping it with very fine soft linen cloth it must then be laid the face downwards on smooth table covered with fan paper or india paper and the cloth on the back must be well soaked with boiling water till perfectly soft and pliable turn the pieture face upwards and having stretched it evenly on the table pin it down with nails at the edges having melted quantity of glue and strained it through flannel cloth spread part of it on linen cloth of the size of the painting when this is set lay another coat over it when this is become siff spread some of the glue moderately heated over the face of the picture and lay over it in the evenest manner pos- sible the linen cloth already prepared and nail it down to the picture and table then expose the whole to the heat of the sun in place secure from gain till the glue be perfectly dry and hard when this is the case remove the picture and linen cloth from the table turn the pieture with the face downwards and let it be stretched and nailed to the table as before then raise round its edge border of wvae as in biting of copper-plates into which pourd corroding fluid as oil of vitriol aqua-fortis of spirit of sali but the last is to be preferred dilute either of these with water to such degree that they may destroy the threads of the original canvas or cloth of the picture without discoloring it when the corroding ffuid has answered this pur= pose draim it off and wash away the remaining paiv by quantities of fresh water the threads of the cloth must be then carefully picked out till the whole be taken away the reverse surface of the painting being thus wholly freed from the old cloth must be well washed with water and left to dry.. in the mcan time prepare new piece of canvas of the size of the painting and having spread some hot glue purified as before and melted with little brandy or spirit of wine over the reverse of the painting lay the new canvas evenly upon it while the glue is hot and compress them together with thick plares of lead or flat pieces of polished mar= ble when the glue is set remove these weights let the cloth remain till the glue is become perfectly dry and hard then the whole must be turned the other side upwards and the border of wax being re placed the linen cloth on the face of the painting must be destroyed by means of the corroding fluids because the face of the painting is defended only by the coat of glue which cemented the linen cloth to it the painting must then be freed from the glue by washing it with hot water the painting may afterwards be varnished and if the operation be well conducted it will be transferred to the new cloth in perfect state when the painting is originally of wood the sur- face of it must be covered with linen cloth ce- mented to it by means of glue as glready directed proper table being then provided and overspread with blanket of thiner woollen cloth laid on in several doubles the painting must be laid upon it the face downwards and fixed sready the board or wood on which it was done must then be planed away till the shell remains as thin as it can be made without damaging the paint under it the process is the saime as already given for the front when picture is by accident torn or otherwise injured it is repaired by placing the separated parts as nearly in their first state as possible then attach- ihig by strong glue piece of cloth of proper shape and size to which the threads of the torn parts firrmly adhering retain their situations the place in the preture where the rent is must then be very exactly colored as before so as effectually to conceal the damage when fresh cloth is applied behind picture cover the back throughout and to strengthen the canvas it is termed lining picture and very much contributes to its preservation espe- ea if the canvas be ancient or thin in its sup- stance ii edit encaustic or painting in wak miss greenlands method of making composition for painting in imitation of the ancrent crecian manner put into glazed earthen vessel o of gum arabic and so of cold spring water when the gum is dissolved stir in of gum mastich which has been first washed dried picked and beaten fine which is very soon done set the earthen vessel containing the gum water and gum mastich over moderate fire continually stirring and beating them hard with spoon in order to dissolve the gum mastich when sufficiently boiled it will no longer appear transparent and will be stiff like paste so soon as this is the case and that the gum water and mastich are quite boiling without taking them off the fire add of white wax broken into small pieces stirring and beating the different ingredients together till the wax is perfectly melted and has bailed then take the composition off the fire as boil- ingitlongerthan necessary would only harden the wax and prevent its mixing so well afterwards with water the composition is taken off the fire and in the glazed earthen vessel it should be beaten hard and while hot but not boiling mix with it by degrees of cold spring water then strain the compo- sition as some dirt will boil out of the gum mastich and put it into bottles composition if properly made should be like cream and the colors when mixed with it as smooth as if with oil the method of using it is mixing the colors with ir as with oil then paint with fair water the colors may be used by putting little fair water over them but it is less trouble to put some water when the colors are observed to be growing dry in painting with this composition the colors blend without difficulty when wet and even when dry the tints may easily be united by means of brush and very small quantity of fair water when the painting is finished put some white wax into glazed earthen vessel over slow fire and when melied but not boiling with hard brush cover the painting with the wax and when cold take moderately hot iron such as is used for iron- ing linen and draw it lightly over the wax when the picture is nearly cold rub it with fine linen cloth to make it entirely smooth and when quite cold rub it again to make it shine painting might be executed in this manner upon wood or plaster of paris without requiring any other preparation than mixing some fine plaster of paris in powder with cold water to the thickness of cream then put it on looking-glass and when dry take it off and there will be very smooth surface for painting upon paintings may also be done in the same manner with only gum water and gum mastich prepared the same way as the mastich and wax but instead of putting of mastick and when boiling adding of wax mix of gum mastich with the sum water before it is put on the fire and when sufficiently boiled and beaten and is little cold stir in of cold spring water and afterwards strain it it would be equally practicable painting with wax alone dissolved in sum water in the following mmanner weigh of cold spring water and of put them into glazed earthen vessel guin arabic and when the gum is dissolved add of white wax put the earthen vessel with the guin water and wax upon slow fire and stir them till the wax is dissolved and has boiled few minutes then take them off the fire and throw them into bason as remaining in the hot earthen vessel the wax might become rather hard beat the gum water and wax till quite cold.. as there is but small propors tion of water in comparison with the gun and wax it would be necessary in mixing this composition with the colors to put also some fair water it should be observed that the water used by miss reenland in these preparations came from chalk fock and was remarkably soft possibly any other water might answer equally well nother recipe by miss creenlawd for the incient grecian method of painting in war take an ounce of white wax and the same weight of gum mastich in lachryme tears that as it comes from the tree which must be reduced to fine powder put the wax in glazed earthen vessel over very slow fire and when it is quite dissolved strew in the mastich little at time stirring the wax continually until the whole quantity is perfectly melted and incorporated then throw the pasts into cold water and when it is hard take it out of the water wipe it dry and beat it in one of mr. wedgwood mortars observing to pound it at first in linen cloth to absorb some drops of water that will remain in the paste and would prevent the possibility of reducing it to powder which must be so fine as to pass through thick gaure it should be pounded in cold place and but little at tine as after long bearung the friction will in degree soften the wax and gum and instead of their becoming powder they will return to paste make some strong gum arabic water and when you paint take litrle of the powder some color and mix them together with the gum water light colors require but small quantity of the powder but more of it must be put in proportion to the body of darkness of the colors and to black there should be almost as much of the powder as color having mixed the colors and no mare than can be used before they grow dry paint with fair water as is practised in painting with water colors ground on the wood being first painted of some proper color prepared in the same manner as for the picture walnut-tree and oak are the sorts of wood commonly made use of in italy for this

painting of which he writes me the following lewis of gurtenbrunn the friend of mengs and who may be called his successor has lately executed picture according to my manner it is thalia done upon wood prepared with wax and is remarkable for the vivacity and splendour of the coloring believe have already mentioned to you in what this new method consists you melt or rather dissolve some good white wax in naphtha petroler without color till such time as the mixture has acquired by cooling the appearance and con- sstence of an oil beginning to freeze by the cold you mix your colors with this and then keep them in small tin boxes you dilute them more or less with the same naphtha according as they dry or as you wish to use them this painting allows time enough to give all the finish you desire and if you wish to work in hurry you may dry it as fast as you please by exposing it to heat when the pic- ture is finished it is of that fine tone which is pre- ferable to every varnish or if you choose varnish you need only warm the pieture and all the naphtha will evaporate when this is done you must wast till the picture cools when you must polish it by run- ning it over neatly with cloth as the ancients used to do if you wish to have it still brighter you must melt white wax on the fire without suffering itto boil mix little naphtha with this and draw layer of it over the picture already heated by means of brazier which you hold under if the picture i small or before it if it is large the colors at first appear spoiled but you restore them to their first beaury if when the layer of was is cooled you polish it by rubbing with cloth it is then that the colors take the high tone of oil if you fear the effects of fire for your picture you are to make soap of wax which is to be done by boil- ing white wax in water in which you have dissolved twentieth part of the weight of the wax of marine alkali or sel de souda very pure rub your picture with this soap and when it is dry polish it as above if you do not choose either of these methods give your painting its usual varnish of sandarac and spirit of turpentine this method has been found prefers able to all those that have been tried and superior to oil for the beauty of the colours there are hanp fine colours which canhot be used in oil which may be made use of with great success in this method the haphtha entirely evaporates one may be assured that this is the true tmethod of painting in wak there is likewise much to hope for the duration of pictures paitited in this manher as wax is much less liable to alteration than oil and does not so essily part its phlogiston this extract seeins to suggestd there probable plah of attaining the ancient secret than that of count caylus of mr. muntz whose rule was to saturate .cloth with wax then to paint on it with waters colours or crayohs and fix the colours by gradually advaficing the pieture to the fire till the wax being melted had absorbed them then equally gradually withdrawing the piece the thought was ingenious but should seem to be more troublesome than that of nir lewis as above after all it may justly be doubted whether some bitumen of still more exalted and spirituous nature was not the vehicle which compounded those colours whose brilliancy has remained from the remotest ages that the ancients were well acquainted with bitumelin ical productions we are well assured and possibly the east may possess some spring of springs of supe- fior or more preservative qualities might not the ingredients they used in embalming afford hint naphtha petroler is bituminous kind of oity out of certain rocks in the territory of mo- dend there are three sorts more or less pure and colourless it is used medicinally and considered as good for sprains bruises ec this at least is the sort sometimes imported into england it is very spirituous and volatile etching this is one branch of the art of engraving and possesses some qualities in which it is superior to others being executed with the utmost ease and ffeedom and when well managed expressing many ubjects with great truth and character the first preparation for etching is to lay ground vide ground over the plate which operation is thus performed at the most convenient part of the plate as well for holding it as for the work which is to be executed on it is tightly fixed hand-vice then the plate is heated till the copper shews small change of color or till the back part of the plate being spit upon rejects the spittle the ball of ground which istied in thin covering of silk is now passed gently over the plate so as to distribure the ground evenly to all parts the heat of the plate melting it through the silk then with the dabber which is nothing more than small quantity of cotton tied in silk the ground is beat of dabbed to perfect thinness and evenness in this part of the business much address is required since if the ground when finished is thicker in some places than in others it will deceive vol ii edit point employed upon it the ground is then smoked till thoroughly black for the clearer dis- cerning the strokes of the etching wax taper twisted together four or five or more times is the most convenient candle to smoke with but any will serve for this purpose the plate must be perfectly clean and free from grease as greasy spots cc prevent the ground from holding in those parts to clean the plate scrape little whiting on it and wipe it off with clean rag which will carry the grease with it while the plate is cooling after the ground is laid scrape some fed chalk on the back of your print tracing or drawing and rub it in all over with clean rag then place the reded side on the plate making it fast at each corner with soft wax lay the etching-board under your hand to prevent brussing the ground and with blunt etching-needle trace lightly the cutlines and the breadths of the shadows till the marks of them appear on the ground which you must take care not to penetrate by tracing too heavily it will be proper at intervals to lift up corner of and to examine whether every part be the tracing perfectly traced before you take it off as it will be extremely difficult to lay the paper down again ex- actly in its former position if once removed having completed the tracing the off-track or drawing traced is removed and the subject is ready for etching the practice of etching is easily attained by profi- gients in design since it is little more than drawing in strokes with point on the plate what is other- wiss drawn with pen pencil ec on paper the etching-board by some termed bridge is thin piece of board generally of mahogany of proper length and width raised by small supports at each end to convenient height for the hand to rest oh it the points or needles are almost similar to sewing needles but are stronger and are inserted into han- dles four or five inches long for the convenience of being properly held the best way to begin subject is by forming the outlines very carefully then inserting the shadows beginning first in the darkest places lines drawn in etching may be crossed by others if wanted two lines drawn by the side of each other closely will unite into one under the operation of biting whereby this line will become of great breadth and color this mode is very usefulfor dark fore-grounds in landscape and has good effect in architecture but the use of etching in historical subjects to prepare the figures to be afterwards treated by the graver the characteristies of etching are certain rough- ness compared with performances of the graver which does not suit glossy and shrning objects but which applies with good effect to coarser parts such as in landscape the barks of trees the broken and looser touches of fore-grounds in architecture it represents very happily the ravages of time in old buildings mouldering walls exc another charac- feristic of etching is its freedom for which reason it suits well the leaves of trees light clouds ec and beside these properties it is of great service where true even and uniform color is wanted as it is not only much quicker but also more certain than simple graving in general hence it suits the blue parts of skies the even teints of new archi fecture back-grounds to portraits which are conducted by parallel-ruler it is evident from the services required that the points to be used must vary in their fineness some lines being made broad others very thin to whet point with perfect truth free from angular projec tions requires time patience and practice the plate being etched the next process is to ex- cavate the lines drawn by subjecting them to the action of aqua-fortis which operation is termed biting directions for biting first examine your work carefully to see that nothing be omitted or any thing redundant if any scratches appear on the ground or any mistakes be committed in the etching they are to be stopped out which is done by covering them with mix- ture of lamp-black and varnish laid on with pencil which when dry will resist the aqua-fortis but it to soimetimes best to stop out these as they occur in the course of the work for by this means they will beless liable to escape notice among the mulaplicity other lines and parts and when the varnish is dry you may etch over it if necessary the next thing to surround the work with rim or border of soft wax about half an ich high forming the wax into spout at one corner by which to pour off the aqua-fortis and that it may not jun out at any other part take care to press the wax close and firm to the plate having poured the mixture of aqua-fortis on the plate let it continue short time corroding the lines drawn wipe off the bubbles as they rise with feather which may remain on the plate during the biting after proper time pour off the aqua-fortis and wash the plate carefully with fair water pour- ing it on and off then let the plate dry and by scraping off part of the ground from the faintest part of the work try if it be sufficiently bitten if not stop out the part you have tried with lamp-back and varnish and when that is dry pour on the aquas fortis again for further operation when the faint parts of your work are bitten enough stop them out with the varnish erc and proceed to bite the stronger parts stopping them out as occasion requires till the whole work is suf ficiently bitten then warm the plate and take off the soft wax after which heat the plate till the ground is melted pour on it little oil and wipe the whole off with linen rag when the ground is taken off rub the work well with the oil-rubber and wipe the plate clean then proceed to finish with the raver what parts of the subject require that process the wax for the border is made by mixing with pound pound of bees-wax one quarter or one third of pound of burgundy pitch to soften it as for any color added to it it is useless because after little while the wax becomes black ii is to be observed that in biting plate much attention is required if plate be under-bitten .. if the parts have not attained their proper color and force there is usually no remedy but by following every line with the graver in order to blacken it on the other hand if very much overbitten plate can not be rendered neat and delicate let never so much time and skill be wasted on it if bitten but little above the color wanted few strokes of the burnisher will lower it at pleasure if the air rising from the copper and forming bub- bles kisses very much ipn biting it may be suspected that the aqua-fortis is too strong or acts too sud- denly on the copper which for tender work is injurious of engraving strokes the tools necessary for engraving are an oil- tubber burnisher scraper and oil-stone also needles or points also gravers compasses sand-bag pa- tallel ruler eic gravers are of different shapes square and lo- several of each should be provided the square is used in cutting the broad strokes the lozenge for the fainter and more delicate parts gravers should be in length five inches and half of thereabouts the handle included the sand-bag is used to lay the plate on for the conveniency of turning it about to follow winding lines the oil-stone must be of the turkey sort and while in use must never be kept without oil great care is required to whet gravernicely par- ticularly the belly lay the two lower angles of the graver flat upon the stone and rub them steadily till they are polished like irror and till the belly rises gradually so that when you lay the graver edge on the plate you may just perceive the light under the point otherwise it will dig into the copper and it will be impossible to execute work with freedom when the belly is whetted to whet the face place the flat part of the handle in the hollow of your hand with the belly of the graver upwards on moderate slope and rub the face on the stone till it has an exceeding sharp point which you may try upon your thumb-pail for tempering the graver if too hard vide graver cut off that part of the handle which is on line with the belly of the graver to make that side flat hold the handle in the hollow of the hand and extend the fore-finger toward the point resting it on the back of the graver that you may guide the tool with more ease take care that your fingers do not interpose be- tween the plate and the graver but let the whole machine slide as it were along the plate and trust to the resistance of the copper for its stegdiness delicacy of feeling is prme quality in good chgraver let the table or board you work at be firm and steady for strait strokes let the plate lie flat on the table for circular or crooked strokes place the plate on the sand-bag and hold the graver firm noving your hand or the plate or both as you see or rather feel convenient learn to carry your hand with such dexterity that you may end your stroke as finely as you began it and if you have occasion to make one part deeper of blacker than another do it by re-entering that stroke in the course of the work scrape off the barb or roughness which arises with the scraper but be careful in doing this not to scratch the plate ne- ver scrape directly acress line but always at an easy angle along the course of the stroke mistakes or scratches in the plate may be rubbed out with the burnisher if of no great depth and the part afterwards cleared with the scraper polish it again at last lightly with the burnisher when you wish to examine what work you have done rub it with the oil-rubber which by filling the strokes with black will shew them when the plate is wiped to advantage too much oil-rubbing injures the finer work as does very materially too mruch scraping engraving in strokes or hatches as it is the most ancient so it is the most noble manner of engraving it requires most skill affords most scope for judg- ment and genius as well as for manual dexterity is accordingly more difficult to execute in masterly and superior manhner it is evident that any line drawn may be crossed by another line or any number of lines by second number of lines but it is equally evident that not every such crossing can be graceful if it follows too nearly the course of the original lines it will form by its intersections number of areds of too sharp and disagreeable lozenge shapes if the first lines are crossed at right angles the areas formed will be so many squares which by possessing kind of hardness in their appearance apply only to certain subjects the medium admits an infinity of degrees if we examine any clarge well-executed print we observe in some places single lines or strokes of considerable length according to the drawing lines crossed at an agreeable lozenge lines crossed at right angles where kind of obscurity is wanted two lozenge lines crossed with third isually much softer and more tender than the two former but following or rather attending their course lines at right angles crossed by third at lo- zenge to divest the squares of their hardness and stifiness lines at considerable distance from each other and of firm color with thin line be- tween them this is called interlining the same sometimes crossed in the saime manner round dots in the flesh long dots for the same pur- bose long dots crossing each other thin lines crossing lines of dots very thin lines made by the dry point in the lights cc and many other contrivances for producing variety these applied vol ii edit according to the indications of the design or the taste and skill of the artist impart to capital prints richness and character which no other man- er of engraving can boast of and which is yet far- ther angmented by judicious introduction and mixture of etching engraving and dry point lines the dry point is so termed because used without ground consequently not bitten the burr or rising from the copper by the use of it is very strong and must be scraped off carefully the whole point and handle is stronger than an etching point to sustain greater pressure when in use it appears from this mode of reasoning that to at- tain considerable excellence in this style of engraving i easy matter and indeed of the many who are brought up to it few arrive at superior hohpours of if they obtain skill in one branch etching for in stance they fail in others yet as much of the progress even of the best of plates is little more than mechanisim and patience abilities of all degrees are useful in the course of long work it is proper to caution-those inclined to attempt any of the branches of engraving against cramp posture or leaning the stomach against the table or poring with their eyes too close to the plate while at work in very delicately finished works the artist always has recourse to magnifying glass but as our readers certainly will not undertake such works we proceed to another species of engraving inngraving engrrving in chalks his manner of engraving has lately highly ex- cited the public attention and indeed has deserved it by the beauty of many specimens which it has produced the process for preparing the plate laying the ground tracing is the same as before the principles adopted in the etching differ only in that instead of fines the drawing shadows eec are in- serted in dots as freely as may be yet carefully the biting is the same with this difference that whereas in biting lines no two should be suffered to unite unless previously intended and prepared for that purpose in biting chalks provided they do not by their union form hard spot or too consi- derable black this accident is not of equal conse- quence if the subject be large in small subjects the more delicate and important parts should not be colored in the etching but wholly inserted with the graver being less hazardous and much more ac- clirate the plate bitten and the ground removed the effect of the subject represented remains to be worked up with the graver for small subjects or such as are to be neatly finished this is the only tool to be depended on the best manner of preparing the graver for firm work is by changing its situa- tion in the handle so that the belly part of it which was lowermost becomes uppermost then by turn= ing the handle in the hand the point acts on the copper from greater elevation which for strong dots is preferable as only dots not strokes are re- quired the tool is in this position manageable with much greater facility and speed the remaining part of the progress of plate con- sists only in covering the copper with dots in man= her lighter or heavier proportionate to the color and to the drawing required when one covering of dots is scraped off another must be inserted and so on by this repetition proper grain of dots and the general masses of shade are procured.. this pro- cess is tedious but in return it requires no great skill in the operator little practice and proper attention attains the whole mystery in larger subjects or those which are to be slighted some persons use tools of various sorts such as wheels with single or double rows of teeth or cradles resembling mezzotinto grounding tool but made with teeth or others constructed to their minds but these tools though more expeditious than the graver only are seldom so accurate of so pleasing in the effect they produce these kind of tools and variety of others amounting in the whole when set is perfect to nnear forty have been very much used in france where the manner of engraving in chalks was first practised they very frequently produce an effect more closely resembling an original drawing in chalks than english performances finished selely with the graver but on the other hand the neat- ness and accuracy as well as certain mellowness of style which distinguish english productions are not only ohly vastly superior to those of the french artists are universally esteemed so throughout europe the chief merit of plates engraved in chalks is inserted by the artist who finishes the subject care and attention is requisite and good habit of design. indispensable every requisite in the manual practice is easily acquired the french have very well imitated drawings on paper by using two plates one of which printed the black-chalk effect the other the white-chalk on the same idea chalk plates printed in black on blue paper may afterwards be touched with white- chalk to very pleasing effect of re-biting when the parts of subject which were intended to be dark have failed of their proposed effect they may be re-bitten by the following process which applies to all kinds of erching and is among the se- crets of the superior engravers at convenient part of the plate being properly heated for the pur- pose melt quantity of ground then with dabber carefully by degrees transplace as much of the ground thus melted as is necessary to the part pro- posed by beating it gently so that the surface only the copper may be covered and the hollows or excavated lines of the work may remain free and clean when this ground is cold it may be re- bitten with aqua-fortis as before it is frequently better not to smoke it lest the heat of the taper should should melt the ground into the work in which case wherever the ground covered the plate the aqua=fortis could not act re-biting is sometimes used both to strokes and dotes to strengthen part which has not acquired all the color it should have even after it has been laid in with the graver to clean strokes erc engraved use little spirits of turpentine and rub the plate with crumbs of bread if the dirt is of long standing soap lees poured on the plate while warming is very effectual but as this is corrosive liquor it must be immediately washed off the plate by plenty of cold water and it too stong for mezzotinto plates especially unless it be very carefully used of meztotinto me is said to have been first invented by prince rupert about the year who took the hint from seeing soldier file his rusty musket and mr. evelyn in his ilistory of chalcography gives us head performed by that prince in this way but mr le blond is said to have introduced it most successfully into practice the prince laid his grounds on the plate with channelled ruler but one sher win about the same fune laid his grounds with half -round file which was pressed down with heavy piece of lead both these grounding tools have been laid aside for many years and hand-tool called cradle resembling shoe- thoemakers ecutting-board knife with fine cre= on the edge was introduced by one ediar smith by trade who afterwards became mezzo- iinto printer as it is much easier to scrape off or to burnish '' away the parts of dark ground corresponding with the outlines of any design sketched upon it than to form shades upon light ground by an infinite num- ber of hatches strokes and points which must all terminate with exactness on the outline as well as differ in their force and mapnner the method of as it is called in mezzotinto becomes con- sequently much more easy and expeditious than any other manner of engravins the instruments used in this kind of engraving are cradles scraf- ers and burnishers the scrapers for delicate york are much like surgeon lancet in shape and in fineness but others are much stronger for greater speed and riddance to lay ground the cradle is to be passed for= wards uniformly in the same direction being kept steady as possible and pressed upon with mode- tate force till- the instrument has passed over the whole surface of the plate this first course of grounding must be crossed at right angles on the same principle new lines must then be drawn dia- gonally and the cradle passed along them as before when the first diagonal operation is performed these lines must then be crossed at right angles the plate having undergone the action of the cradle accord- ing to this disposition second course of cradling must be commenced and the same must be re- peated regularly changing the direction of the lines made by the tool when the whole of this opera tion is finished it is cailed one turn but in order to produce very dark and uniform ground the plate must undergo the repetition of all these opera- tions many times ing the plate is prepared with ground the skeich must be traced on it by means of the paper rubbed on the back-side with chalk as mentioned before it is also proper to over-trace the lines and drawing afterwards with black lead or rather which i much better with indian ink to secure the out- lines the scraping is performed by partuse away the grain of the ground in various degreess so that none preserves its original state ex cept the touches of strong shadow the general manner of proceeding is like drawing with white up- on black paper the masses of light are first begun and those parts which lighten upwards but are in shade below the reflections are then touched after which the plate is blackened with printers black- ing-ball made of felt in order to view the effect the whole is then gradually brought to effect by scraping over the parts till they are sufficiently lightened observe always to begin with the strongest lights it is easy to scrape more off any part if it be too dark but if part be too much scraped away it is troublesome for it must undergo the action of small cradling tool proportioned to the size of the part and the additional ground thus procured is not always correct march to the original ground which has has an unpleasant effect unless very skilfully ind- raged me plates are therefore proved long before they approach toward finishing if the subject be in any degree intricate or considerable of aaua tinta this manner of producing on copper the effect of drawing washed in bistre or indian ink is altoge- ther modern invention it was attempted in by mr. sandey and mr. dalton but it then failed of that success it has since met with first person whose productions were not only imitations of drawings but were capable of printing any considerable number of copies was mons le prince of paris whose early performances appeared in his modes usages de russic mons le prince by degrees improved his discovery till at length it was thought by the honourable mr. greville brother to the earl of warwick secret worth purchasing at the expence of thirty guineas this gentleman communicated the process to mr. sandby whose attention and genius carried it to great excellence since its importation into engÂ¬ land it has been the subject of repeated and conti- nued investigation and as it was impossible to pre- vent the inquisitive essays of many ingenious engrds vers who thought this article worth their acquisi- so it has happened that more ways than one of producing this effect have been discovered each person thinks his own method the best and all vol ii edit stadiously conceal their principles we may there fore claim the ment of being the first in england at least who communicated the secret to the public we shall report several modes of procedure first way we shall mention of producing on copper the effect of tinted drawings is by grind- ing quantity of sulphur in oil and with this mix- ture painting the plate then by placing the plate over gentle fire the vitriolic acid contained in the sulphur is set at liberty and acts as corrosive on the copper forming color lighter or deeper in roportion to the heat of the fire the time of its exposure to it and to the strength of the acid em- ployed in the mixture second way of producing the same effect on the well-known different affections of the same menstruum to different metals and pro- ceeds thus saturate quantity of aqua=fortis of due strength with shreds of silver this liquor poured on copper will quit the silver it contains in order to act on the copper by which it is more attracted the silver will precipitate in the form of subtle powder and thereby occasion irregularities on the surface of the plate which will hold the ink when printed of these manners of procedure the first is very offensive in its process the fumes of the composition being highly disagreeable the second is chieffy applicable to very slender parts and to add color to places which are not of importance sufficient to require fresh ground or much trouble such as leaves of trees light fiying clouds erc as it does not much force without great good fortune or very close attention third way proceeds on the principles that minute interstices alternately black and white will when viewed at little distance produce the effect of all black according to the tone to which they are adapted therefore whatever will so fix irself to the plate as to prevent the action of aqua-fortis where it in contact and yet will pertit the aqua-fortis to corrode all around it will produce alternarely blacks and whites this was first attempted with rosin finely pulverized but that was apt if too fine or t much warmed to form coat or superficies over considerable parts of the copper thereby resisting the menstruum on all sides sal ammoniac pulve- rized with the rosin and antimately mixed with it was found to preserve interstices but this applies only occasionally there are several guins which possess nearly simi- lar properties but the following appears superior to all others and is excepting the change of gum junt- per for guin copal the method followed by mions he prince grind sufficient quantity of gum copal divide it by sifting into three or four parcels at pleasure according to the fineness of each parcel the first or finest powder serving for the lighter parts of the sub- jeet to be treated such as distances sky erc.. the second or grained powder for middle tints the coarser grains of powder for fore-grounds and other very dark places where strong biting is required by the subject to accomplish this separation the sieyes milst vary in fineness sift on the plate suffic crent quantity of the finer powder the plate will now appear of an uniform tender white unless closely examined when the interstices between the particles of gum will be very discernible heat the plate very gently only till the sum changes from its white color and is so far melted as to fix on the plate from which it is scarcely to be distinguished by iis color when cold the plate is ready for receiving the aqua- fortis stop out the lights cc as in common biting when the biting is over which does not last long minute perhaps to the fine powder wash the plate with water as before directed for biting and examine the effect produced and the state of the ground if some parts only are done stop them out and proceed to bite the other parts if the whole be done of which this ground is capable clean the plate by heating it and apply little oil to remove the gum easily if necessary those parts which are of the just color required must then be secured by stopping them out the second powder must next be treaied as the first has been and the coarser powders or rathergrains of gum must be treated in the same manner to procure the bolder strengths but these may endure proportionately stronger biting it is necessary to have more powders than one be- cause the hold the powder or grains has of the cop- per will permit only certain degree of action in the aqua-fortis the grosser the grains the stronger hold they take of the copper they will bear more heat to fix them and will suffer more copper to be cof- away from around them but then they would make very staring whites were not ground previously laid by the others or if they were mis- placed on subject they would greaily disfigure it sometimes finer tint may be laid over coarser to good advantage sometimes larger grain of whites may be pro- cured by melting the finer powders more than usual which by spreading each particle of gum makes each grain cover greater surface which it protects from the action of the aqua-fortis it requires some patience and facility with the pencil to prepare the plate by stopping out which operation is not only to be attended to at first to preserve the whites but may be repeated at any time provided the grains of powder attached to the plate appear able to sustain the biting necessary to produce the color proposed every manner of engraving by aqua tinta has much of uncertainty connected with it and requires ot only good judgment but great attention and some perhaps good deal of good luck to succeed happily if therefore any mode of practising it could be reduced to certainty of producing the effect required and could be so conducted as to be under command it would be fortunate discovery the first difficulty in aqua tinta is to get the ground perfectly even and uniform to accomplish this we have two objects in view the first is to compose ground which shall be properly divided into material which may produce grains to resist the aqua-fortis material which will produce interstices to admit the aqua-fortis the best way at present known is to bruise grind break and sift together repeatedly till the com pound powder appear of one uniform color the gum copal with proportionate quantity of asphaltum which will make powder of pretty nearly equal fine- ness now the gum copal will be fixed on the plate by being melted by means of so gentle degree of heat as will not affect-the asphaltum this powder then being loose admits the aqua-fortis to surround the grains of gum.. other powders may be discovered to answer the same purpose and indeed whatever is near the specific gravity of the guin nay succeed in practice the second object we have in view to lay the grounds perfectly uniform and evenly distributed over the surface of the copper it is true that steady hand may sift powder through fine sieve very evenly if the eye follow it closely and this tnethod is not to be despised but almost every body must have observed that powders of all kinds are precipitated when at rest in water very evenly and uniformly if then quantity of water having proper proportion of powder diffused in it be poured on plate the water may be drained from it by proper inclination of it while the powder re- mains behind when the water has entirely quitted the plate the ground thus obtained may be set by being warmed as before menstruum in which the grains of gum are dissolved and intimately mixed may be yet better tum or rosin dissolved in spirits of wine the liquer being being poured on the plate the spirits will evaporate and the rosin becoming dry will form itself into grains which being fixed on the plate allow inter- stices for the action of the aqua-fortis as the time necessary for putting border of wax round plate is more than is engaged in the biting of light ground some artists make use of trough properly painted and secured from the action of the aqua-fortis into which when filled with aqua-fortis and after having stopped out all that is to be left white on the plate not forgetting the margin they plange the plate and suffer it to remain there only so long as they judge necessary to produce the color wanted if upon examination the plate be not bitten enough they plunge it again till they are satisfied do this they do to every ground till the plate of these modes of practising aqua tinta sup= poses good deal of trouble in stopping out the parts which are to be left white there have been there- fore other methods suggested which for some sub- jects answer better first lay ground of gum copal grain all over the surface of the copper when this is cool and ready for use paint with the shadowing composition mentioned below in the same manner and with the same freedom as with indian ink the shadows of the subject if it be landscape the foliage of the trees ecc let it be thoroughly dry then with large soft camel hair pencil cover over the whole with the asphaltum varnish and when that is thos roughly dry plunge the plate into water in short space space of tithe the water penetrating through this vainish will dissolve the sugar or the treacle which forms its composition and that rising will part from the copper and bring with it all that covers it leaving the copal ground unaffected by the wa- rer and still adhering firmly to the plate this bite before the asphaltum varnish is made by dissolving four ounces of asphaltum in about eight ounces of spirits of turpentine using very gentle heat pour off the liquid and add more of either ingredient as the varnish may be thought too thick or too thin the shadowing compositton is made by tak ing any quantity of treacle and grinding it into paste with whitening or by taking of coarse sugar about two ounces of whitening about one ounce and grinding them with sufficient quantity of wa- ter to form paste proper for use by the pencil if any hard edges occur in aqua tinta they may be softened by the burnisher or the burnisher may insert lights or slight touches of drawing exc occa sionally to advantage the aqua-fortis used in this method of engraving should not be too strong because as its operation always rapid if too strong it will break up the ground and do other mischief before it can be pre- vented it is not bad way to try the strength of it before it be used on separate piece of copper very great disadvantage attending re-tinting of any part is the nicety required to match color in fact it is hardly possibly to lay two grounds so pre- crsely alike as is requisite for that purpose nav it fre- '' frequently happens that second ground obliterates or at least damages the first over which it is laid aqua tinta is method of engraving if it may de- serve that title so very rapid that it will produce on large plate in one week the effect of months labour at some other kinds of engraving it is in ge neral however but shallow on the copper yet when well managed is sufficiently lasting its merit consists much in very even colour smooth and free from blemishes it applies well to architecture to landscape and to back-grounds though do not think much use can ever be made of the invention yet think proper to insert here the mode of etching upon glass or rather the discovery of solvent which acts upon glass as aqua-fortis does upon copper the acid for this purpose is procured from sparry fluor or derbyshire blue john powdered and by means of concentrated vitriolic acid submitted to distillation by gentle heat what comes over and unites with proper quantity of water in the receiver which is of lead as well as the retort is

little finger generally supplies the place of pencils this art succeeds best in chalk engravings the prints if touched up with colours after they are printed will approach very beautifully toward the effect of pictures of cutting in wood this business is properly neither scuipture nor engraving but being applied to many of the pur- poses of engraving it claims affinity to that art the smoothest grained woods are the best such as pear- tree or beech but above all box the surface being prepared by smoothening thin coat of white lead tempered with water is passed over it the outlines of the design are traced with black lead pencil or ink and the design is laid on the block then wetted and carefully rubbed on the back till the lines traced are transferred to the white lead which shews them plainly the blank parts are then cut away with sharp knives small chissels or gravers as required this kind of work differs from engrav- ing on copper in that the parts of the copper which are out out hold the ink and form the impres- sion in this the parts which remain being promi- nents perform the same business the blocks are printed as letter-press this kind of work has been made to produce an effect resembling washed drawings by using several blocks correspondent to the several colors of the de- sign the ink being accurately mixed to the color wanted is applied all over the surface of the block and the darker colors printed after the lighter aqua tinta has superseded the use of this method but one similar to it is practised at paris only using copper plates instead of wooden blocks and printing the separate parts of the design in their proper colors by which they are very prettily tinted in delicate works or parts expressive of distances to slope away the surface of the wood gently in those parts produces good effect because in the print- ing they less hold the ink and less ink is pulled off them by the paper consequently they appear fainter. of modelling this is one branch of the art of the sculptor and in many cases very important one being to all works of considerable size an indispensable requi- site previous to cutting the marble being also the usual mode in which young sculptors study the prin- ciples of their profession academy figures ecc the tools for this purpose are usually slender sticks of wood made by the artist himself and therefore of shape at his pleasure but whatever other im- plements may occasionally be employed the thumb and fingers generally perform the major part the clay to be used should be fine soft free from stones dirt cc and be carefully examined before it is used in london this kind of clay is procured from about vauxhall to model bas relief on strong board of suf- ficient size sketch the dimensions of the subject in- tended then place the clay which is morst and ad hesive laying greater quantity on the parts which are to be raised to give them thickness and follow- ing the course of the drawing proper to the subject to model figure it is sometimes requisite to in sert little sticks into the limbs and other parts which will not support themselves without props but this requires care it is liberty very allowable in mo- delling to support the figure with beds of clay in convenient places where they do not injure the com- position since these kind of models are to be consi- dered as little more than sketches or preparatory studies the model is quitted if not finished it must be kept cool and morst by being covered with wet cloth if model is intended to be preserved it must be set by to dry very thoroughly then taken to where it must be gradually hardened and baked there are many risks attending this process if the clay be not dry within however it may appear without sudden heat will spoil it or if there re- main any stone concealed in it when the heat of the fire reaches that stone it will explode and crack the piccc if the colour of the clay used is not approved of it may be painted in distemper after being burnt oil colors having glossiness are seldom employed to prepare for large piece of sculpture.â€”the model is finished as above the size of the figure intended and then molded in separate parts in which when re-united is cast plaster-figure which is repaired cut scraped erc with great accuracy this figure is now the standard from which copy in marble is to be taken the original part of the business being over to model in wax.â€”the process is much the same as with clay to temper the wax some add to pound of wax half pound of colophony some add turpentine melting the whole with olive oil some insert little vermilion or other color to give it tint wax will readily take every color added to it and is accordingly sometimes used to imitate life in which procedure cleanness of tint must be carefully attended fin sculpture mr. bacon having communicated to the public in the cyclopedia some remarks on that profession in which he excels to offer it to our readers re- quires we presume no apology they are as follows is probable that sculpture is more ancient than painting and if we examine the style of ancient painting there is reason to conclude that sculpture stood first in the public esteem as the ancient paint ers have evidently imutated the statuarles even to their disadvantage since their works have not that freedom of style more especially with respect to their composition and drapery which the pencil might easily acquire to greater degree than that of the chissel but as this is universally the case it can not be attributed to any thing else besides the higher estunation of the works on which they formed themselyes which is the most difficult art has been question often agitated painting has the greatest number of requisites but at the same time her ex- pedients are the most numerous and therefore we may venture to affirm that whenever sculpture pleases equally with painting the sculptor is cer- tainly the greatest artist sculpture has indeed the honour of giving law to all the schools of design both ancient and modern with respect to purity of form the reason perhaps that being divested of those meretricious ornaments by which painting is enabled to seduce its admirers it is happily forced to seck sculpture dictionary aits titat eganit geet tt the es tht for its effect in the higher excellencies of the art hence elevation in the idea as well as purity and grandeur in the forms are found in greater per- fection in sculpture than in painting besides what= ever may be the original principles which direct our feelings in the approbation of intrinsic beauty they are without doubt very much under the infiuence of association custom and habit will necessarily give false bias to our judgment it is therefore na- tural and in some measure reasonable that those arts which are temporaneous should adapt them- selves to the changes of fashion cc but sculpture by its durability and consequent application to works of perpetuity is obliged to acquire and maintain the essential principles of beauty and grandeur that its effect on the mind may be preserved through the various changes of mental taste it is conceived that it will scarcely admit of question whether the ancients or moderns have most excelled in this art the palm having been universally adjudged to the former to determine in what proportion they are superior is too difficult an attempt wherever there real superiority in any art or science it will in time be discovered but the world ever fond of ex- cess never stops at the point of true judgment but dresses out its favourite object with the ornaments of fancy so that every blemish becomes beauty this it has done by ancient sculpture to such de= gree as not to form its julgment of that by any rules but to form an opinion of rules by the example as long as this is the case modern art can never have fair comparison with the ancient this partiality to the ancients is so strong as to prevent almost all dis= crimination and is the sole reason why many an- liques that now stand as patterns of beauty in the judgment of most connorsseurs are not discovered to be copies this is not more important than it is easy to be perceived by judicious eye for where- ever there is grandeur or elegance to an eminent degree in the idea and general composition of sta- tue and when the execution of the parts called by aftists the treating of the parts betrays want of faste and feeling there is the greatest reason to con- clude that the statue is copy though we were ever so certain of its antiquity and surely if evidence of pictures being copy proportionably diminishes value the same rule of judgment may may be no less properly applied to statue modern and ancient art can never therefore be fairly compared till both are made to submit to the determination of reason and nature it may be observed that the anciepts have chiefly confined themselves to the sublime and beaunful and whenever pathetic subject has come before them they have sacrificed expression to beauty the famous groupe of niobe is one instance of this kind and therefore however great our partiality to the ancients may be none can hesitate to affirm that whenever the moderns shall unite great expression with great beauty they wrest the palm out of their hands in sculpture the first thing done is out of great block of marble to saw another of the size required which is performed with smooth steel saw without teeth casting water and sand thereon from time to ties then by taking off what is superfiuous with steel point and heavy hammer of soft iron it is brought near the measure required and still nearer with finer point they then use flat cutting instru- ment having notches in its edge of teeth and then chissel to take off the scratches the other has left till at length taking rasps of different degrees of fineness they gradually bring the work into con- dition for polishing to polish or make the parts smooth and sleek they rub them with pumice-stone and smalt then with tripoli and when still greater lustre is re- quired they use burnt straw to proceed the more regularly on the head of the model some place an immoveable circle divided into degrees with moveable ruler or index fast- ened in the centre of the circle and divided likewise into equal parts from the end of the ruler hangs thread with plummet which serves to take all the points to be transferred thenteito the block of marble from whose top hangs another plummet like that of the model but other excellent sculptors disapprove of this method urging that the smallest motion of the model changes their measures for which reason they rather choose to take all their measures with the compasses though reckoned more tedious in large figures the first part of the business being labour and not skill it is committed to under- orkmen and indeed the whole of this part of the profession being to copy the model the mdster seldom troubles himself to work at it at least till the close of the process in dd tol ii edit imitating bas reliets if it be subject which admits of being laid flat they endeavour to bring the copy to cast the same shadows as the original sculpture has been in england rather monumen= tal art than as it is in many other countries de= corative profession of late we have had many elegant chimney-pieces of sculpture but very few large figures except fortombs our best specimens in public are the statues of phrenzy and melancholy on the piers before bethlehem hospital which de- serve to be ranked among the first performances in this art they were executed in the reign of charles ii by garrtel cieeer father of the poet-laureat there is also most elegant statue of king edward vi in bronze which stands in one of the courts of st. thomas hospital in southwark by scheema- ker and one of sir isaac newton at cambridge roueillyac westminsterâ€”abbey is the most famous repository of sculpture in england and it contains many fine specimens but the fighres lose much of their effect by being crowded together without order whereby one groupe injures another st. pauls cathedral has lately received further em- bellishments by sculpture and more is intended it affords many noble opportunities and situations for capital groupes in all parts but especially in the circumference

valuable and newly discovered color and is prepared by two brothers of the name of gravenhorst at brunswick hithereto it has been kept secret but it is conjec= tured to be precipitate of copper which has been dissolved in tartar and water by coetion and which evaporation of the lixivium is deposited in the form of cupreous tartar similar color is sold by mmessrs brandran and co. in sise-lane london which possesses many if not all the rare qualities of that prepared at brunswick earth white.â€”many ingenious men have employed their talents in discovering more whole- some and cheaper pigment than white lead and perhaps the finer and whiter sorts of earth might be usefully substituted the terra goltber gensis is of white color which is dug up in se- veral parts of germany more particularly at golts berg whence its name and strigaw and at lignitz in silesia at this time it is procured in the neigh- bourhood of ifasselt in the bishoprick of liege in the circle of westphalia where it is usually sealed with the impression of an eagts and the words goltbergensis â€” oftobacco-pipe clays there are also several sorts that appear convertible into pig= ments especially one of this class which is found near lymington in hampshire which is not at present but the earth termed melimim turned to much use melinum has ever been famous in the annals of painting being the principal white of the painters of antiquity it is still found in the same place from whence the painters of old had it viz the island of wilo called melos by the greeks whence its hname and is common in all the adjacent islands it is not quite so bright white as white lead but as it never turns yellow as white lead does it is far preferable to that article in the course of time besides as most of the discoloring substances of earths may be attributed to iron if it were treated with marine acid the brightest might be improved orange lake.â€”this may be prepared by boil ing four ounces of the best spanish annotto and one pound of pearl ashes for the space of half an hour in one gallon of water strain the tincture and mis it gradually with solution of pound and half of alum in six quarts of water desisting when no ebul- lition ensiues treat the sediment as is usual in com- thon lake and dry it in square bits or rolls cc patent vellow.â€”this color for which the ingenious mr. turner has patent is prepared by triturating red lead and common salt together in mortar and then exposing them in crucible made of tobacco-pipe clay to certain heat the sait is decomposed the marine acid uniting with the cals of lead forms the patent yellow and the basis of the salt which must be carefully washed out is the mineral alkali of so much consequence in the soap glass and other manufactories sugar of lead.â€”lead and its calces may be dissolved by the acctous acid and will afford cryss tallizable salt called sugar of lead from its extreime sweetness this like all the preparations of fead deadly porson it has the property of rendering oils thicker and causing them to dry more rapidly to make white precipitate of eead if small quantity of strong nitrous acid be poured on litharge which see the acid unites itself to the metal with considerable effervescence and heat some water being now poured on and the glass vessel con- taining the mixture shaken turbid solution of the litharge is made if small quantity of acid of viz triol be now added it throws down beautiful white precipitate and the acid of nitre being left at liberty to act upon the remainder of the litharge begins anew to dissolve it with effervescence.. when it saturated which will be known by the discon- finuance of the bubbles more acid of vitriol is to be dropped in and white precipitate is again throwis down if any of the litharge remains undissolved the nurous acid being set at liberty second tiime attacks it as at first and by continuing to add acid of vitriol the whole of the litharge may be converted into most beautiful and durable white unfortu= pately this color can not be used in ofl though in ater it seeims superior to any .. if the process be well managed an ounce of nitrousacid may be made to convertseveral poands of litharge into white of this kind k has been strongly recompmended to paper and others who use water-colors in large quang tities to prepare their lakes and the colors now pre- pared of chalk on the basis of the above precipitate of lead.â€”for instance if the color required be very fine one suppose from cochingal the coloring thatter is to be extracted by spirit of wine without heat when the spirit is sufficiently impregnated it is to be poured by little and little upon the cals the spirit soon evaporates and leaves the calx co- lored with the cochineal more of the tincture to be poured on rubbing the mixture con- stantly and thus by proper management many beautiful colors not inferior to the best carmine may be prepared when only small quantity of color for the more exquisite touches of the miniag ture painter is required we would recommend the process to be conducted on the basis of white precipi- tate or cale of tin pursuing the same method of rubbing in the coloring tincture as when whice pre- cipitate of tead is used if instead of cochincal brazil-wood turmeric legwood exc be substiruted different kinds of red yellow and purple may be produced way of conclusion to this part of our work we shall add some miscellaneous remarks ex- tracted from small work by the late ingenious mr. rorertson which being only distributed among his private friends and never published is in few hands and being the result of the experience of many artists communicated to him as well in italy as in england and written down by him will we hope be acceptable to our friends as certainly many of the ideas and hints are very good ground and peiminh forrester communicated to me the followins ubservations which he had from mir patoon and

second painting whether of flesh drapery landscape to paint only with earths reserving the most clear and brilliant colors for the last painting and glazings by which means greater truth and force

under the more delicate which will make them last and bear out the befter whilst on the contrary if earths are used upon the clear and brilliant colors the effect must be both stull and heavy besides if in dead or second co- foring the finest and brightest tints are used what colors can be found to brighten or finish with the method used by pietro bianchi who was very ingenious and general painter and whose pic- still maintain great clearness and freshness though done forty fifty or sixty yearsâ€”is this he took one half of drying oil and the other half of clear nut oil these he mixed well together and his picture being dry he rubbed with sponge of brush these ixed oils upon the pieture leaving it only damp therewith after which he re-painted of fe-touched at pleasure this method was given by an old scholar of john baptista bougieuty who was well acquainted with the said prerso branchi the same person also informed me that his own master baptista bougicur made use of the thick white var- nish sold in the color-shops for re-touching and re painting but the consequence was that after some years all his pictures becarhe covered with stuff like mildew which after being cleaned off would shortly-return signior gaspar scarmouchi who is also an ingenious man and scholar of lucatelli recoms mends the use of poppy oil for according re-touchs ing or re-painting picture which he says will never change and dries much sooner than nut ous the method of applying it is by letting the picture be well dried then rub with small sponge dipped in the oil the part of the painting which you intend to re-touch after that spread the oil with the palm of the hand which will make the colors spread and work very agreeably mr. andrews says that if you would unite any part of picture in water colors whether sky face drapery or any other part you must wer the picture on the back with clean sponge moderately so as to damp the colors after which you may re-touch scumble or re-paint as often as you please pro= vided the size with which you mix your colors is neither too weak nor too strong and that the preture be painted on an unprimed fine cloth of silk.â€” this mr. patoons secret

clearness inso much that there will not be the least occasion for varnishing those parts when the whole is finished only covering the other parts that appear dull or sunk in according to mr. jenkins when the varnish is very dry on the pietare the best method is to rub on the part to be painted or re-touched little purified nut oil which must be wiped clean off so as to leave only little dampness

wrought into the state of drying oil not to mix and make other unprepared parcels dry but alone as the sole vehicle of the colors the convenience of this is the speedy drying of the paint so composed
