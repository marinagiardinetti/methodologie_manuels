all the train of graceful studies coinciding therewith is even necestary to form the minds of youth for whatever station designed since nothing informs or corrects our ideas so soon as true knowledge of symmetry and pro portion although this art in its extent be as spacious as observation can discover or imagination conceive yet in the following sheets may be found an abstract containing examples amply sufficient to direct genius in the least apt or inquisitive not forgetting diligence but laying aside fear because every fresh attempt on the same subject will evidence an amendment to encourage the learner it would be rash on sudden to expect perfection in this art yet after few painful essays pleasure succeeds in the prospect and grows in the practice beyond that of any other acquisition and sure no one would spare the means where the end is so desirable not one book has hitherto appeared in this coun try well suited to facilitate the attainment of this art yet we are always invited to attend to ample and -learned in structions to beginners where the preliminary discourses often puzzle and confuse the ideas more than the examples they recommend are ever able to eradicate but since exam ple has made verbal instructions expected we here subjoin such as seem to us necestary for work of this kind viz any of the following examples being placed before you black lead pencil and paper are all the requisites needful then slightly sketch the general proportions from the object so placed which carefully survey and alter by rubbing it gently out with stale bread or india rubber slight ly and cautiously retouching with more correctness still keeping your copy so faint that you may with ease rub out and amend it when you can find no farther disagreement from the original in your sketch fresh point your pencil and keeping waste paper under your hand begin to finish your out-line taking particular care to observe and imitate such parts as appear dark distinctly from those which are faint or smaller the strong touches being what give spirit tet the put-line and when properly given always denote master ’ hand let your greatest application be employed ia making perfect out-line for in this principally consists the art of drawing this fully attained the study and practice will become delightful the out-line compleated light and shadow become your next concern which is labour so pleasing that no commendation can be given adequate to tste pleasure real professor finds in the execution of this art or rather science succeeding art beginners are apt to leave the study of out-lines too soon and so commence painters like those who raise structure ere the foundation be compleated light and shadow are produced by etching or hatching washing chiarjo oscuro painting modelling sculpture as the first three are chiefly used by learners we shall give few hints for the executing of each and first of hatching carefully observe the burin or manner in which the strokes of the original are laid and keep with exactness the form not so much regarding their number first slightly making them all of thickness and after by various retouchings strengthen them to the tone of colour in your original whether you use black or red chalk or black lead which may be used singly or thus compound ed working the fainter black lead and give strength with black chalk or finishing your drapery hair and eye-brows in this manner and the flesh or naked with red chalk this method is best for copying engraved prints which we principally recommend to beginners next of washing or shading with indian ink go exactly over your out-line with pen dipped in common ink with clean stale bread or india rubber rub out all remains of your black lead then mix your indian ink by rubbing it in an earthen saucer with water till it is pretty black then take another clean saucer and dip your pencil in the indian ink and with water mix it to the lightest shade as it dries- deepen it where necessary till you come up to the strength' of your original this method is most proper to use in drawing from mezzotintos or paintings lastly of crayons beginning with black and white take blue or purple-coloured paper and having exactly formed your out-line begin on the second degree of your shades and with black chalk darken downwards then take white french chalk to be had at all colour strops and heighten the lighter parts to perfect white in this manner all paintings may be copied in their proper colours by having different crayons of each colour from dark to light in due gradations and practising by the preceding rule rolling piece of paper to point and dozzeling or rubbing each co lour on the paper when finished to prevent their coming off which yet will be tender
