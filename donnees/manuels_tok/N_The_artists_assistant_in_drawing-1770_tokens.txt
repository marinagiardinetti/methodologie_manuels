we would recom- mend le cleres principles of drawing as the calfeft and beft calculated for the instruction of beginners this may be had price where this book is publifhed having provided this begin with the outlines of the feveral features as eyes nofe mouth ears gc as they occur in the book practife thefe often orer till you are quite mafter of them then proceed to profile or side-face after that to an oval or full face always remembering that each of thefe muft be perfectly attained before you venture to proceed further when vou can copy face correctly the next thing is to draw the feveral limbs or parts of the body as the hands arms feet legs coc then go on to the body isfelf which having done you will fart ansun er eccumensie aoers insoad be able to undertake whole figure obferving carefully the exact proportions and bearings of one part with respect to the other the learner ought to be particularly cautious that he do not attempt whole figure before he has made himfelf mafter of the feveral parts for this is begin- ning the work at the wrong end and is indeed the fame thing as if man should attempt to climb to the top of houfe without the help of the stairs as for beafts birds fruit plants oc we deem if afeless to give directions for drawing them as it is well known that he who has to far improved his ideas as to be able to draw human figure correctly will find it no difficulty to perform every other branch of this art sketch or draw all your outlines faintly with of foff charcoal which may be known by the pith in the middle cut to pointlike pencil and when you fee any thing amiss whilk it out with of feather correct your errors with black-lead pencil and compare your work with the original till every part of them perfectly correspond this done finith your outlines with black lead or indian ink this advice properly attended to will lave you an infinite deal of trouble in drawing over and over again to your no fmall dilcouragement if you prefer indian ink rub it with water upon marble fold for that purpofe where this book is publifhed and with crow-quill pen perfect your outlines then rub out the marks of the pencil with bread.—keep three or four different shades of ink in the hollows of your stone to diftinguith your diftances referving one of the holes for water when you are thoroughly verfed in the ourlines your next bufiness will be to learn to thadow but of this hereafter under the arucle of light and shade be not too hally at firtt fetting out which will but impede your progress and hunder your improvement whereas by beffowing little more time you will aftain perfection fooner than you can well imagine and expedition will come of itfelf as you become more experienced of copying of draughts then you would copy print or drawing exactly of the same size rub the back of it with the duft of red chalk or black lead lay this upon your paper and pin it down at the four cor- ers then with blunt point trace the ourlines and breadths of the shadows which done having care- fully examined it to fee that nothing be omitted take eff and finith it with the pencil or pen another way to make an exact copy and at the same time to preferve the original is to lay piece of tranfparent paper upon it and draw the outlines thereon with black-lead pencil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin poft-paper reddened or blackened at the back after which proceed to trace and finith it according to the foregoing rule if you would reverfe your original you need only turn the tranfparent paper with the drawing you have made upon it downwards upon the poft-paper and trace it as above directed the tranfparent paper may be had where this book is publifhed of enlarging and contralling ivide your original with pair of compalfes le into any number of squares and rule them across with black-lead pencil from side to side and from top to bottom then then having your paper of the size you intend divide it into the fame number of squares either bigger or lets as you would enlarge or contract it place your original before you and draw square by square the feveral parts obferving to make the part you are drawing fall into the same part of the square as it does in your original to prevent mif- takes number the squares both of original and copy as in fig and il of the drawing-plate then outline it with indian ink rub out the marks of the pencil with bread and shade it at pleafure of imitation of life et the perfon you draw after be of propor- tionable size and well shaped place him in the eafieft and moft natural atticude then sketch faintly with your charcoal the head or any of the limbs feparately which having carefully done pro- ceed to finith with your pencil when you have fufficiently practifed the feveral parts or lumbs you may draw the whole figure in whatever attitude you think proper to place it be- ginning with the cafieft and proceeding by degrees to the more difficult poftures as time and expern- ence shall enable jou befure to finith your outline to correctly marking all the mufcles as they occur that even before you give it any shadow it may have

the peculiar caft and dif pofition of every feature with the exacteft nicety and as this is of all the parts of drawing by far the moft difficult it will require more than ordi- nary attention and should be laft attempted of drepery rapery is the art of cloathing your figures with elegance and propriety when your naked figure is outlined firft draw the ourlines of the drapery lightly then the greater folds and afterwards the leffer obferving never to let them crols each other particular regard is to be had to the quality of the drapery as the folds of stuff or woollen cloth are more abrupt and harth and thofe of silk more flow- ing and eafy linen cambrick gaure coc as their subftance is lighter than either require ftill greater delicacy in expresting the waring of the folds by the faininels of their shadows the drapery should not stick too clofe to the bo- dy but muft feem to ffow round it as it were yet in such manner as that the motion of the figure may be free and eaty great lightness and motion of the drapery should only be ufed when the fi- gures are fuppofed to be in much agitation or ex- poted to the wind but in calm place and free from violent action their drapery should be large and flowing in order to give them more graceful appearance let the loofe part of the drapery blown by the wind all fow one way and draw that part which lies drawing-plate.aa clofeft to the body before you draw thofe which ay off suit your garments to the body and make them bend with it the clofer the garment fticks to the body the narrower and smaller muft be the folds and if it fits quite clofe there will be no folds at all but muft only have faint shadow to reprefent the part of the body which lies under it by obferving diligently in what manner the drapery flows upon any

wonderfully replenith their minds as to co- lour and effect of light and shade tthe true distribution of light and shade in picture is abfolutely neceltary to be known as it not only determines the proper diftance of one object from another without which the whole would be an undiffinguithable mass of confulion but it orves likewife to each respective object its substance roundness and effect shadowing is performed with the pen or pencil in either of which great judgment is required having made your outlines correct the firft thing is to obferve from which side of the original the light comes in which if natural is either from the right hand or left for whenever the light appears in the middle of picture and feems to glare more than ordinary it is caufed by candle lamp or some other luminous body and is called an artificial light lay on your light tints firft dispoting them as you fee they are done in the original and then proceed to the deeper ones till you come to the darkeft parts of all for you may at any time darken your sha= dows when you can not lighten them let all your shadows in the same piece fall on the same side that is if the right side of man face be dark to muft be the right side of his body arm thigh but if the light side be darkened b the opposition of some other body intercepting the light it muft receive contrary shadow make your shadows fainter as they grow towards the light breaking them gradually that they may not appear too fudden or harfh if you fhade with black lead or with crayons you may blend your shadows and foften them one into

divifion in the bafe to its oppofite point in the horizon rule perpendicular lines then diride the sides into the same number ruling paral- lel lines acrots from point to point so will your pavement be divided into quare feet becaufe the eight feerinlength multiplied by the same in breadth give the number of iquare feet or pieces of marble contained in the whole then rule diagonals from corner to

the outlines and breadths of the shadows till the marks of them appear upon c ground which you muft take care not to pene- trate by tracing too hard as great nicety is required in this part of your work it will be necelfary now and then to lift up one corner of your original and examine whether every part be traced before you take it off as it will be extremely difficult to lay it down again in its for- mer polition direttions for riching aving carefully traced your original take ii off and lay silk or linen handkerchief next the plate and over that your eiching-board then proceed to the etching for which observe the following directions which are adapted to every par- racular brench as landlkips shipping portraits hiffory architecture in landlkips or the faint parts of any other picture are the firft to be done and thefe are to be worked clofer and with tharper-pointed needle the darker parts muff be erched wider and with blunter needle but to prevent miftakes the needles may be marked according to their different degrees and the ufes for which they are intended as for the very fainteff parts of all they are to be left for the graver or dry needle of which here- building and all architecture in general ufe parallel ruler till frequent practice enables you to do them well enough without the needles may when necelfary be wherted upon your oil-stone keeping them turning

upon the stone of biting or eating in the work with aqua fortis tirst examine your work carefully to fee that nothing be omitted and if any scratches appear upon the ground or miftakes be committed in the etching they are to be stopped out which is done by covering them with mixture of lamp-black and varnish laid on thinly with hair-pencil which when dry will refift the aqua fortis but it will be beft to stop out thefe as they occur to you in the courfe of your work for by this means they will be lets liable to efcape your notice and when the var- nith is dry you may etch over it again if required the next thing is to enclofe the work with rim or border of foft green or other coloured wax about half an inch high bending the wax in the form of spout at one corner to pour off the aqua fortis and that it may not run out at any other part take care to lay your wax fo clofe to the plate that no vacancies be left your aqua fortis muft be fingle and if too frong as will be feen in the biting take it off and mix it with little water shaking them together in bot- tle and when by often uling it becomes too weak it may be ftrengthened by mixing it in bottle with little double aqua fortis the bottle which con- tains the aqua fortis should have large mouth and glats stopple let the aqua fortis hie on the plate short time wiping on tie bubbles as they arife with feather which may remain upon the plate while it is biting after which takein off and wath the plate with wa- ter then let it dry and by fcraping off part of the ground from the fainteft part of the work try if it be bit enough and if not stop out the part you have tried with the lamp-black and varnish and when that is dry pour on the aqua fortis again when the faint parts of your work are bit enough htop them out and proceed to bite the ftronger parts ffopping them out as occafion requires till the whole work is fufficiently bit then warm the plate and take off the foft wax after which hear the plate till the ground melts pour on little oil and wipe the whole off with rag when the ground is taken off rub the work well with the oil-rub- ber and wipe the place clean then proceed to finith it with the graver according to the following di- rections chap iv of encr vin pthe tools neceftary for engraving are the oil- rubber burniffer scraper oil-stone nee- dles and ruler already mentioned to be ufed in etching allo gravers compaffes and sand- bag yravers are of two sorts quare and lozenre three of each sort should be provided the firit is ufed in cutting the broader strokes the other for the fainter and more delicate and both sorts may be had at the white lion and key in fefter-lane no graver should exceed the length of five inches and half the handle included excepting for ftrait lines the sand-bag or cuthion is ufed to lay the plate on for the conveniency of turning it about and may be had at the fame place as may likewife the oil- stone which muft be of the turkey sort of whetting and tempering the graver great pains are required to whet the graver nicely particularly the belly of it care muft taken to lay the two angles of the graver which are to be held next the plate fat upon the stone and rub them freadily till they are polifhed like mir- for and till the belly rifes gradually above the plate to as that when you lay the graver fiat upon it you may juft perceive the light under the point other- wife it will dig into the copper and it will be impot fible to keep point or execute the work with freedom in order to this keep your right arm clofe to your side and place the fore-finger of jour left hand upon that part of the graver which lies upper- moft on the stone when this is done in order to whet the face place the ffat part of the handle in the hollow of your hand with the belly of the graver upwards upon moderate slope and rub the extremity or face upon the stone till it has an ex- ceeding sharp point which you may try upon your thumb nail the oil-stone while in uufe muft never be kept without oil when the graver is too hard as is ufually the cafe when firft bought and may be known by the frequent breaking of the point the method of tempering the steel is as follows heat poker red-hot and hold the graver upon it within half an inch of the point waving it to and fro till the steel changes to light straw-colour then put the pont into oil to cool or hold the graver clofe to the flame of candle till it be of the same colour and cool it in the tallow but be careful either way not to hold it too long for then it will be too foft and in this cafe the point which will then turn blue muft be broken off and wherted afresh and tempered again if required but be not too hafty in tempering for fometimes little whet- ting will bring it to good condition of bolding the graver vut off that part of the handle which is upon the same line with the belly or sharp edge of the graver making that side fiat that it may be no obftruction hold hold the handle in the hollow of your hand and extending your fore-finger towards the point let it feft upon the back of the graver that you may guide it flat and parallel with the plate take care that your fingers do not interpofe be- tween the plate and the graver for they will pre- vent you from carrying the graverlevel with the plate and from cutting your strokes to clean as they ought to be direftions for engraving et the table or board you work at be firm and ready upon which place your sand-bag with the plate upon it and holding the graver as above directed proceed to bufiness in the following man- ner for ftrait strokes hold your plate firm upon the sand-bag with your left hland moving your right hand forwards leaning lighter where the stroke should be fine and harder where you would have it broader for circular or crooked strokes hold the graver redfaft moring your hand or the plate as you fee convenient learn to carry your hand with fuch slight that you may end your stroke as finely as you began it and if you have occafion to make one part deeper of blacker than another do it by degrees and that you may do it with greater exactness take care that your strokes be not too clofe nor too wide in the courfe of your work crape off the barb of roughness which arifes with the belly of your graver but be careful in doing this not to fcratch the plate and that you may fee your work pro-

art which has generally appeared difficult yet there is no re- prefentation can be more elerant than that of picture donewell in this manner for it gives all the sofiness that can be defired in picture and is eaty to work as there are no outlines to draw nor any shades to make but the colours are put on without the trouble of either the pictures are thofe done in mezzotinto for their shades being rubbed down on the glats the several lines which reprefent the fhady part of any common print are by this means blended together and appear as foft and united as in any drawing of indion ink provide fuch mezzotintos as you like cut off the margin then get piece of fine crown-glats the size of your print as flat and free from knots or scratches as poffible clean the glass and lay some venice turpentine quite thin and fmooth on one side thereof with bruth of hog hair lay the print ffat in water and let it remain on the surface till it finks tis then enough take it care- fully out

turpentine till it is exactly even with the print let it fall gently on it press the glass down carefully with your fingers in feveral parts to that the turpentine may stick to the print after which take it up then holding the glats towards you press the print with your fingers from the centre towards the edges till there be no blifters remaining when this is done wet the back of your print with spunge till the paper will rub off with your fingers then rub it gently and the whice paper will roll off leaving the imprettion only upon the glass then let it dry and with camels-hair pencil dipt in
