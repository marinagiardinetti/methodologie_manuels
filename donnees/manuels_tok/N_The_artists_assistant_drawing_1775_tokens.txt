the ar- tanment of any art or science to leave them enveloped with difficulries which if not ut= terly infuperable arleaft difcourage the learner from proceeding in study which he can have little hopes will ever reward his purfuit from hence we may reafonably infer that the faid profeffors were totally unacquainted if not with the theory ar leaft with the practical part of what they underrook to reach others and that the inftructions they have given were founded rather upon bare suppofition of their efficacy than upon the furer bafis of long and repeated experience which alone could have enfured their success and from which with all due deference to the judicious whole sanction we shall at all times be ambitious to deferve we may venture to anfwer for the practicability of our own to

as they occur in the book practife thefe often over till you are quite mafter of them then proceed to profile or side-face after that to an oval or full face always remembering that each of thefe muft he perfectly attained before you venture to proceed further when you can copy face correctly the next thing is to draw the feveral limbs or parts of the body as the hands arms feet leys coc then go on to the body itfelf which being done you will part be able to undertake whole figure obferving carefully the exact proportions and bearings of one part with respect to the other the learner ought to be particularly cautious that he do not attempt whole figure before he has made himself mafter of the feveral parts for this is begin- ning the work at the wrong end and is indeed the same thing as if man should attempt to climb to the top of houfe without the help of the stairs as for beafts birds fruit plants coc we deem it ufeless to give directions for drawing them as it is well known that he who has to far improved his ideas as to be able to draw human figure correctly will find it no difficulty to perform every other branch of this art sketch or draw all your outlines faintly with piece of foft charcoal which may be known by the pith in the middle cut to point like pencil and when you fee any thing amiss whifk it out with handkerchief or feather correct your errors with black-lead pencil and compare your work with the original till every part of them perfectly correspond this done finith your ourlines with black-lead or indian ink this advice properly attended to will fave you an infinite deal of trouble in drawing over and over again to your no fmall difcouragement if you prefer indian ink rub it with water upon marble old for that purpofe at the star holborn hill and with crow-quill pen perfect your our- lines then rub our the marks of the pencil with bread.—keep three or four different shades of ink in the hollows of your stone to diffinguith your diffances referving one of the holes for water when you are thoroughly verfed in the outlines your next bufiness will be to learn to fhadow but of thus hereafter under the article of light and sbade be be not too hafty

will come of itfelf as you become more experienced of copyinc of draughts you would copy print or drawing ✓ exactly of the fame size rub the back of it with the duft of red chalk or black lead lay this upon your paper and pin it down at the four cor ners then with blunt point trace the ourlines and breadths of the shadows which done having care- fully examined it to fee that nothing be omitted take it off and finith it with the pencil or pen another way to make an exact copy and at the jame time to preferve the original is to lay piece of tranfparent paper upon it and draw the outlines thereon with black-lead pencil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin poft-paper reddened or blackened at the back after which proceed to trace and finith it according to the foregoing rule ifyou would reverfe your original you need only turn the tranfparent paper with the drawino you have made upon it downwards upon the poft-paper and trace it as above directed the tranfparent paper may be had at nc hol- forn- iill of enlarcinc and contracting ivide your original with pair of compaffes into any number of squares and rule them across with black-lead pencil from side to side and from top to bottom then then having your paper of the size you intend sivide it into the fame number of squares either bigger or lefs as you would enlarge or contract it place your original before you and draw square by square the feveral parts obferving to make the part you are drawing fall into the fame part of the as it does in your original to prevent mif- takes number the squares both of the original and copy as in fig and of the drawing-plate then outline it with indian ink rub our the marks of the pencil with bread and shade it at pleafure of imitation of life et the perfon you draw after be of proporti- as onable size and well-fhaped place him in the cafieft and moft natural arritude then fkerch faintly with your charcoal the head or any of the limbs teparately which having carefully done proceed to finith with your pencil when you have fufficiently practifed the feveral parts or limbs you may draw the whole figure in whatever atticude you think

is outlined firft draw the outlines of the drapery lightly then the greater folds and afterwards the lefier obferving never to let them crofs each other particular regard is to be had to the quality of the drapery as the folds of stuff or woollen cloth are more abrupt and harth and thofe of silk more flow- ing and eafy linen cambrick gauze or as their subftance is lighter than either require ffill greater delicacy in expreffing the waving of the folds by the faintnets of their shadows the drapery should not flick too clofe to the body but muft feem to flow round it as it were yet in fuch manner as that the motion of the figure may be free and eaty great lightness and motion of the drapery should only be ufed when the fi- gures are fupposed to be in much agitation or cx- poted to the

ruling parallel lines acrots from point to point so will your pavement be divided into square feet becaute the eight feet in length multiplied by the fame in breadth give the number of square fect or
