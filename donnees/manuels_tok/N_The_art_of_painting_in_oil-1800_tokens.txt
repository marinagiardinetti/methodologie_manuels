opinion that of thefe four colours they made their first or dead-colouring how it really was time has put it out of our power to determine but if we suppofe thofe four principal colours in perfection then think it can be no longer doubted but that from thefe judici- oully varied might be made all the colours in nature for my part can not believe that the four capital colours of the ancients would mix fo that perfection we fee in the works of titian and rubens and if we have no certain knowledge of ii of their method of colouring who lived in the laft century how should we understand their who lived near two thouland years ago and why the method and practice of colouring to well known to rubens and vvandyke should not be continued down to the prefent mafters is to me furprifing it is plain from the works of their pupils that they knew their method becaufe in their pictures we fee the fame fort of colours and colouring and from the liitle variety of capiral colours ufed by them it is not to be doubted but that the whole was comprited in few principles neither difficult nor tedious all the mafters from rembrandt funk gradually below each other in the art of colouring therefore we may with cercainty date the decline of that art from him can not attribure this gradual degeneracy in the knowledge of to charming an art to any thing but inability or want of generofity or both though thefe gentlemen were not able to give us to perfect an account as the great mafters yet they might have commanicared what they had learned from them iii them and if it was againtt their own private

lay or grounds very near alike and with colours that kindly united and were as near to the life as poffible on which they laid their virgin temts with light flrokes of the pencil and thus they imitated the force and frethness of nature they were convinced that there were certain colours which deftroyed each other if they were mixed to excels and that they should be as little shaken as poftible by the motion of the pencil it is certainly true that the great mafters both ancient and modern imitated nature in their firft painting or dead-colouring to far as they could without dirtying the colours ommiiting only the finishing touches and colours that should come laft which defign to thew in the courfe of this work in vi in the moft intelligible manner and exactly to the rules and methods of the beft practitioners some painters imagine the great mafters had colowrs which we have no knowledge of and it is probable they might yet confels fee none of them in the pictures of vandyke and rembrandr but what are common to painters only fome of them are better than ours which would be remedied if that art was more encouraged by the painters thofe we have am convinced would appear much finer if they were laid on droper grounds painter should have as great regard to his firtt lay as he has to the fucceeding parts of his work sir godfrey kneller in sir peter lely time

ground of the ffeth with this colour and the fhade teint we should make out all the fieth dsaon like claro obfcuro or metzotinto we should alfo re- member that this colour will grow darker becaufe it is in its nature too ftrong for the white therefore we should b art of painting in oil it by mixing vermillion and white with it in proportion to the fairness of the complexion and though it is thus mixed yet shall call it the light red teint in all the courfe of this work becaufe would not have the vermillion teint confounded with it as if there was no difference vermillion feimt is only vermiltion and white mixed to middle teint it is the moft brilliant light red that can be it agrees beft with the white light red and yellow teints iii carmine teint is carmine and white only mixed to

is good working colour remember the oker is too frong for the white therefore we should make allowance in ufing it it follows the light red teints and yellows should always be laid before the blues if we lay too much of it we may recover the ground it was laid on with the light red teints vi blue teint is made of ultramarine and white mixed to lightith azure it is pleafant working co- lour with it

mixes very kindly with the red shade and blends agreeably with the middle teints in the dead colouring it is charming glazing colour for the eye-brows and darkeff fhadows it is of all the moff

teint jx red thade warm shade art of paintinc in oil the finithing pallet for complexion requires fix hore viz carmine and its teint lake brown pink ivory- black and pruffian blue the layingon of dead colouring divide into two parts- one call the first lay or ground the other the laying on virgin teints the firft lay of colours confifts of two parts the one is the work of the fhadows only and the other that of the lights the work of the hadows is to make out all the draw- ing very correctly with the fhade teint in the same manner as if it was to be done with this colour only remember to drive or lay the colour paringly the lights should be all laid in with the light red teint in different degrees as we fee them in nature thefe twocolours united produce clean tender middle teint for mixing with the fhade-teint they turn to pearly hue and by flrengthening them with the light red we may work to very good refemblance in uniting the lights and fhades we should ufe long foftener about the fixe of large fwan quill which will help to bring the work into character and leave the colouring more delicate then go over the darkeft fhadows with the red of warm hade which will finith the firft lay the warm shade being laid on the shade teint im- proves it to warmer hue but if laid inflead of the fhade teints it will dirty and fpoil the colours it mixes with and if the red thade be laid firft inftead of the shade teint the fhadows would then appear too red and bloody therefore notwithflanding thefe two colours are the beft that can be for the fhadows yet they are too ftrong to be laid alone which is proof of the great ufe and ert of painting in ote and merit of the fhads teint here we may obferve that the shade and light red teints are fo friendly and delicate in their nature that they will not dirty though we are continually changing them how proper then and agreeable to our purpofe are they for making the moff principal part of the likenets when in altering and changing they always produce clean colour of the in- viring pearly hue thesecond part of the first painting in order to finish the firft painting improve the reds and yellows to the complexion and after them the blues obferving that the blues on the reds make the purple and on the yellows produce the green the same me- thod is to be underftood of the fhadows but be fure to leave them clean and not too dark therefore allowance should be made in the grounds with the light-red becaufe glazing them will make them darker when the cloth is of dark or bad colour there muft be ftrong body of colour laid all over the fhadows fuch as will not fink into the ground but appear warm and little lighter than the life to that it may be of the fame forwardness to finith as if it had been light ground therefore the bufinets of dead colouring is that we leave it always in the same order for finifhing though the colour of the cloth be quite the reverfe am convinced by experience that the grounds of thadows in what we call the dead-colouring should be fich the art of painting in otl fuch as will support the character of the finithing colours which ground muft be clean and little lighter than the finifhing colours fay little lighter becaufe the finish- ing of the fhadows is glazing and no other method but glazing can leave fuch brilliancy and beauty as they ought to have for find that glazing the fhadows in the firtt painting is not fo proper as laying body of shadow colours that are very near to the life though little lighter thefe may be glazed and touched upon whendry with great deal of eafe but if we begin the firft painting with glazing we shall find it will fare and be of no ufe and the folid colours which are laid on it will look heavy and dull therefore all shadows and colours that are to be glazed should be done with colours of clean folid body becaufe the glazing is more lafting and has the beft effect on fuch colours re- member to leave no roughnels mean fuch as will ap- pear rough and interrupt or hurt the character of the finifhing colours which by examining the work whilft it is wet with foft tool or when it is dry with knife may be avoided as it will eafily take off the knots and rougheft parts the light red and white improved is fuperior to all other colours for the firft lay or ground which should be always done with full pencil of ffiff colour made brighter than the light becaufe it will fink little in drying the greater the body and quantity of colour and the hiffer it is laid the lets it will fink every co- lour in drying will fink and partake in proportion to its body of the colour it is laid on therefore all the lights of the fieth if not laid on light ground muft confe- quently change little from the life if there is no allow- ance the art of paintinc in otl made the fhade teint for the fhadows should fall into the rofe teinr as the complexion grows delicate all which should be ligntly united with foft long pointed hog-tool to the lights making out the whole metzotinto believe the great mafters very feldom tab loucned or fzcerened the colours but in uniting the firft lay they were very careful in preferving the brightnets of their colours and therefore did not work them below the complexion for to force or keep up brilliancy grounds can only be done with the whites reds in the and yellows which method will make up for the defici- ency of the white grounds therefore the firft painting should be left bright and bold and the less the colours are we should forbearulingany colours broken the better that will produce them and be contented to add what is wanting in the next painting where if we fail clean rag will resfore the firft ground second painting the second painting begins with laying on the leaft quantity that can be of poppy oil then pe it almoft all off with dry piece of filk handkerchief the second painting is alfo divided into two parts call the firr lay of the second painting which is scumbling the lights and glazing the fhadows the other finishing the complexion with the virgin teints and improving the likenets as far as we can without laubing scumbling t art of painting in oil scumbling is going over the lights where they are to be changed with the lightred teints or fome other of their own colours fuch as will always clear and im- prove the complexion with fhort ffiff pencils but fuch parts only as require it otherwife the beauty of the firft painting will be spoiled and we make ourfelves double wwork the light red teint improved is the very best colour that can be for fcumbling and improving the complexion in general where the thadows and drawing are to be corrected we should do it with the shade teint by driving the colour very ftiff and bare that we may the eafier re- touch and change it with the finithing teints some parts of the shadows should be glazed with some of the tranfparent thadow-colours fuch as will improve and come very near to the life but be fure not to lay on too much of it for fear of loting the hue of the firtt paint- ing the ground of which should always appear through the glazing be very careful in uniting the lights and shades that they do not mix dead and meally for the more the lights mix with the shades the more meally thofe fhades will appear thus far the complexion is prepared and improved in order to receive the virgin teints and finithing touches c art of paintinc in oil the second part of the second painting is to go over the complexion with the virgin teints thefe are the colours which improve the colouring to the greatelt perfection both in the lights and hadows this should be done in the fame manner as we laid them in the second part of the firft painting that is with the reds yellows and blues blending them with delicate light touches of the tender middie teints without fofening we should leave the teints and their grounds clean and diffinet and be content to leave off whilft the work is fafe and unfullied leaving what is farther re- quired for the next fitting for in attempting the finithing touches before the other is dry we lofe the pirit and drawing and dirty wherever we touch the third painting or finishing i is to be fuppofed the complexion now wants very little more than few light touches therefore there will be no occation for oiling begin with correcting all the glazing firft where the glazing ferves as ground or under part then we should determine what should be done next before we do it art of painting in oil to that we may be able to make the alteration on the part with one flroke of the pencil by this method we preferve both the glazing and the teints but if it happens that we can not lay fuch variety of teints and finithing colours as we intended it is much better to leave off while the work is fafe and in good order becaute thofe few touches which would endanger the beauty of the colouring may eafily be done if we have patience to ftay till the colours are dry and then without oiling add thofe finithings with free light strokes of the pencil believe that rembrandt touched upon his beft pictures great many times letting them dry between it was this method moft certainly which gave them that fur- prifing force and spirit which is fo inimitable find it much eafier to foften the over firong teints when they are dry than when they are wet becaufe we may add the very colours that are wanting without endangering the dry work if any of the colours of the pallet want to be little changed to the life when we are painting it is much better to do it with the knife on the pallet than with the pencil becaufe the knife will mix and leave it in good order for the pencil of bace grounds vandyke made out the keeping in his back-grounds more from the different opposition and harmony of the colours than from his knowledge of the claro obfcuro confess can not find in his pictures that intelligence of the ert of paintinc in oil light and shade which is to ftriking and beautiful is rembrandrs vandyke general method was to be very still and mellow and to break the colours of the ground with thofe of the drapery this will certainly produce farmony the principles of which method belong only to the art of colouring but it is the knowledge of light and shade that gives that furprifing force and ftrength which at firft fight we find in rembrandrs works have feen picture of lady where he has made the ground light enough to thew her complexion and hair which was dark brown and in the greateft perfection the ground was wall which near to the face was lighter than the thadows of the ffeth and the light di- minified to artfully in the gradations that though the part round the head was much darker yet it appeared to be of the fame colour with that near the fleth muft own like this method of relieving the head from the ground better than vandykes method where he has made the ground almoft of the fame colour with the hair and though admire this way of breaking the colours of the ground with thofe of the draperies yet am not fo much pleated where there appears too near famenets as have feen in fome of his pictures where he has carried this principle fo near that it is almoft im- perceptible in rembrandts pictures at farmouth the lights and fhades are as vifible as thofe in his prints and are remarkably broad clear and still the fhadows are very warm and thin and look as if they were painted all at once with plenty of colour which appears tranf- parent which tranfparency was done by glazing the dead colouring to the aywtenc in oil the art oe principal colours that are neceffary for painting back grounds in portraiture as walls buildings or the like are white black indian red light and brown oker pruffian and burnt umber from which the eight principal teints are made as follows pearl is made of black white and little indian red lead of black and white mixed to dark lead colour fellow of brown oker and white olive of light oker pruffian and white plesss of indian red and white mixed to middle teint murrey of indian red white and little black mixed to kind of purple of middle teint stone of whice umber black and indian red dark shade of black and indianred only here the lead teint ferves for the blues the fiesh teint mixes agreeably with the lead and the murrey is very good blending colour and of great ufe where the olive is too ftrong the umber white and dark shade will produce fine variety of ftone colours the dark shade and umber ufed plentifully with drying oil make chariming warm fhadow-colour all the colours should be laid with drying oil only becaufe they mix and fer the better with the foftner where the marks of the trowel are fo ftrong in the priming of the cloth that one body of colours will not be fufficient to conceal it we should lay colour to pre- vent it which should be dry before we begin with thofe parts we expect to finith at once painting the the art of painting in oil method of painting back grounds divide into two parts the firtt part is the work of the firft lay the second is to follow on that with the finithing teints of the first lay we should always begin from the fhadowed fide of the head and paint the lights firft from them go into the gradations and thadows which should be done with fiffith tool very paringly with the dark shade and white litle changed with the colours that will give it more of the required hue but very near in regard to tone and firength leaving them like metzotinto the dark and warm thadows should be laid before the colours that join them this we should do with the dark shade and umber drove with drying oil fay before the colours that join them becaufe if thofe colours were laid on firft they would interrupt and spoil the tranfparency which is their greateft beauty the more the firft lay is drove the eafier and better we may change it with the finithing teints therefore we may lay them with the greater body the second part is to follow directly whilft the firft lay is wet with thofe teints that we think are the moft proper to harmonize and finith with begin with the lights firft and remember as we heighten and finith them we do it with warmer colours and let thofe be accompanied with fine tender cold teints the lighteft part of the ground is always neareft to the thadowed art of painting in otl lhadowed fide of the head this is the part which go- verns all the reft and should be painted with variety of light warm clear colours which vanish and lofe their firength imperceptibly in their gradations thefe should be laid with kind of cloudy touch rather than potted and we muft take care that we do not cover too much of the firft lay but confider it as the principal colour from the lights we go to the gradations and fhadows for when the lights are well adapted to produce and support the head it is eaty think to fall from them into whatever kind of shadows we shall find moft proper for our work then foften and blend the whole with long large hog-tool which with the ftrength and body of the drying oil will mell and fweeten altogether in tuch flattering manner as will seem furprifingly finished remember the teints will fink and lofe little of their rrength and beaury in drying all the grounds as walls exc should be finished at once painting but if they want to be changed we may glaze them with little of the dark fhade and drying oil drove very bare on which with few light touches of the colour that is wanting we may improve their hue the dark hadows may alfo be ftrengthened and improved by glazing which should be done after the figures are nearly finithed for fear of making them too frong obferve rembrandls grounds are rather brighter in the lights and have more variety of reints than any other painters for he had obferved and juftly t that thofe teints diminith in proportion with the lights therefore his fhadows have but faint appearance ofteints he underftood the gradations in perfection by the rrt of paintinc in oil mixing and breaking the firft lay of colours fo artfully that they fiatter us in regard to their real ftrength frefnoy fays let the field or ground of the picture be pleatant free trantent light and well united with co- jours which are of friendly nature to each other and of fich mixture as that there may be fomething in it of every colour that compofes your work as it were the contents of your pallet lles alfo obferves that variety of teints very near of the fame tone emploped in the fame figure and often upon the fame part with moderation contribute much to the harmony aill the curtains should be dead-coloured when we paint the ground and should be done with clean colours of near hue to the intended curtain fuch as will fupport the finithing colours do it with tender fort of keep- ing and near in regard to their tone in the lights but much fofter in the fhadows all which should be mixed and broken with the colours of the ground and as .elnoy obferves bodies that are biack in the ground should be painted with colours allied to thofe of the ground itfelf ir will often happen for want of the life or fome defign teat we can not make the iolds the firft painting we should then leave the maftes of light and thadow in regard to the keeping of the picture broad and well unired together tuch as may feem eaty to finith on the colours of the landicaps in back-grounds should be broke and foftened allo with thofe of the parts which jomthem this method brings them into keeping which will make all the parts of the ground as it were of one to that the diffcrent parts do not fiares nor cut at extremities the the art of paintinc in otl sky should be broke with the lead and the ffeth teints the murrey teint is of great ufe in the grounds of diftant objects and the umber and dark fhades in the near grounds the greens should be more beautiful than we intend them becaufe they will fade and grow darker after all is painted we should go over the whole very lightly with the foftener as we did the grounds which will make it look agreeably finithed copying the author of the nalyfis of beauty the late nir william hogarth has given his opinion of copying in his true fpirit and genins treating with ridicule one of the moft ufeful parts of painting but this impute to his purfuing an originality of ideas peculiar to himfelf which did not render it neceffary for him to have recourfe toancient pictures yet to him we are indebted for the beft collection of moral and satirical subjects that have graced the prefent century among which are his fix celebrated pictures of the marriage -la-mode lately fold at chriftic to john julius angerffein efq and which retain their original purity and fine colouring is it reafonable to believe that painter who unders flands the true merit of copying would treat that part of the art with contempt which the greateft mafters have always practifed and effeemed men of common fenfe know that artifts in all ages have copied and ftudied each other in whatever they found moft for their purpofe art of painting in oil for the advancement of their art was it not for this the art itfelf would foon dwindle and decay and with this has not been the cafe with us rubens ftudied principally the works of titian paul veronefe and tintoret that is he copied fuch of their pictures as he thought moft worthy of his imitation and kept them for his own ufe vandyke copied titian and all the venetian fchools or in de piless phrafe skimmed their cream teniers is celebrated for transforming himself into as many mafters as he copied which he aid fo exactly that it is hard to diftinguith the copies from the originals hanneman copies of vandykes are taken for the originals of that great mafter have feen copies by stone fold at great for undou ted originals notwithflanding they were divefted of that free penciling and charming variety of feints which are fo apparent in vandyke buckfhorn was one of the laft good copiers we have had in england the reft that followed him and his mafter lely foon drindled to half artiffs there is copy of buckthorn painting after vandyke which like much better than any of stone mean the picture of the earl of stafford and his secretary in the late marquis of rockingham collection which is well painted and defervedly efteemed believe every one that has heard of andrea del sarto copy of leo the tenth painted by raphael and julio romano will be convinced of the great ufe and merit of an art to which is owing that great number of originals how abounding in every country by-originals mean pictures impoted as fuch by our ingenious and honeft dealers to adorn the cabinets of the virtuofi and con- poiffcurs art of paintinc in oil it is furprifing that fince the age of thefe great mafters we have not had man able to make fine copy from any one of their pictures and believe if such genius should hereafter arife it is to be feared the deftroyers of the art if they are fuffered to go on will fcour off the remains of their beauties fo that very little will be left for him to ftudy and by the end of this century there will be none fit for copying it is in vain for man to think of making fine imitation of any of the great mafters without being thoroughly acquainted with the nature of colours and of colouring and without being clearly convinced at fight of the picture he is going to copy of the method and principles on which it was painted it is the want of this knowledge and conviction which leads us into to mahy errors and miftakes painter that has acquired any fort of manner will always tincture his copying with the fame now we are apt to fall into manner before we underftand the nature of colours which is the cafe where fome pre- dominant colour or hue appears in all the complexions alike for this reafon painter whole carnations are too red will certainly make his copies bluth or if his colouring and fhadows be heavy they will of courfe fall into the obfcuro by the same rule whatever teints in feet his colouring the fame will unavoidably taint his copying for which there is no cure becaufe he himself is infected it is very rare to change bad manner in colouring for better that raphael michael angelo lconardo da vinci julio romano and other great mafters spent their whole lives without truly underftanding good colouring art of pairting in oil colouring nd though colouring is the principal ex- cellence in copying yer it is necelfary that every artiff should avoid particular manner with his pencil other- wife it will certainly be feen in his work from whar has been faid on this subject apprehend that it appears that the art of copying which was prac- tifed by the great mafters in order to catch each other excellencies and perfections and by which their noble works have been to often repeated and as it were re- newed is fo far from deferving contempt that it ought to be enccuraged as thing highly ufeful and worthy of elteem of painting draperies in order to underfland the nature and different degrees of colours or teints ufed in painting draperies firff determine how many divitions are abfolutely necelfary to make the firtt lay of colours and after that the reffec tions and finithing teints the right method of painting draperies or fatins in- general is to make out the whole or what call the firft with three colours only viz the lights middle teint thade tent we should obferve that the lights should rather in- cline to warmith hue and the middle teint should be made of friendly working colours fuch as will always mix of clean tender coldith hue the shade teint should art of painting in oil should be made of the fame colours as the middle teint only with lets light therefore this teint will allo mix of tender clean colour it is with thefe three colours we should make out the whole like metzotinto and we should underftand that all the beauty and character of the folds the shape attitude and principal lights and shades are all to be confidered and made with thefe three colours only which should be done to our fatis- faction before we add any of the reffects or finishing teints the reflections of draperies and fatins are generally productions of their own and are always lighter than the shadows on which they are found and being pro- duced by light will confequently have light warm colour mixed with the local colour that receives them here it will be neceffary to obferve the general method and secret in managing the colours of the firft lay and thofe of the refiections and finishing teints in the firft lay the high lights should be laid with of ffiff colours and then fhaped and foftened into character with the middle teint very correctly where the gradations of the lights are flow as in the large parts it will be proper to lay the middle teint firft at their ex- tremities with tool that will drive the colour and leave it fparingly becaufe the lights will mix and lie the better upon it next is to make out all the parts of the fhadows with the thade teint drove bare fter this comes the middle teint which fills up and ferves as the second lights and gradations and should be managed to- gether very nicely to character without touching any of the high lights which finith the firft lay the art of painting in ofl reffects and finithing teints are in general the antipathies of the firft lay they will without great care poifon and dirty the colours on which they are laid and therefore should be laid with delicate light touch with- out foftening if it is overdone we muft endeavour to recover it with the golour of the part on which it was laid this may be done directly or when it is dry we should alfo obferve whether the reffects proceed from the same colour or any other that the method of uing them is the fame before proceed to the particular colours it will be proper to make fome obtervations on their grounds it often happens that the colour of the cloth is very improper for the ground of the drapery and when it is we should change it with thofe colours which we think are moft proper to improve and fupport the finith- ing colours this method of dead colouring muft con- sequently preferve them in the greateft luftre in dead- colouring we should lay the lights and shades in man- ner fo as only to thew faint idea of them with regard to the shape and roundings of the figure if we have defign to work from then it will be proper to make all the large and principal parts in their places which should always be done with colour that is clean and lighter than the intended drapery though in general of the fame hue and let the fhadows be no darker than middle teint thefe should be mixed and broke in ten- der manner and then foftened with large tool to that nothing rough and uneven be left to interrupt or hurt the character of the finithing colours white the art of paintinc in otl satin all whites should be painted on white grounds laid with good body of colour by reafon this colour finks more into the ground than any other there are four degrees of colours in the firft lay to white fatin the firft is the fine white for the lights the second is the firft teint which is made of fine white and little ivory-black mixed to an exact middle degree between the white and middle teint this colour follows the whire and it is with this we should fhape the lights into character before we lay on any other and take care that this firft teint appears diftinctly between the white and the middle teint otherwife the beauty and the character of the fatin will be spoiled the middle teint should be made of white black and little indianred thefe three colouys are very friendly and mix to beautiful clear colour of pearly hue which has the true brightness and warmth of the general hue of the fatin remember to allow for the red huc changing little to the lead if there is occafion to make any part in the middle teint lighter we should do it with the firft teint only this colour should alfo be laid paringly before the white in all the little lights that happen in the middle teinrs and fhadows on which we should lay the white with one light touch and be fure not to cover all the parts that were made with the firft teint if we do it will fpoil the character and look like spot for want of the foftening edge or border which muft be between the white and the middle teint the lhade teint should be made of the fame colour as the middlg reint but with lets white to that it be dark enough the art of painting in ote for thadows in general with which we should out all the parts of the shadows nicely to character which is the work of the firft lay had next follour the rencus and hrithing teints drown oker mixed with the colour of the lights is the molt afeful colour in general for all reffects in dra- -peries that are produced from their own colours all reneyes are made with the colour of the parts from which they are produced and the local colours that receive them there are but two reflecting teints wanted for draperies in general mean to any one particular colour one should be lighter than the middle teint the other darker thefe colours may be little changed on the pallet with the firft and middle teints as occafion requires or lightly broken on the part that receives them but this laft method is not to fafe as the other the teint fufficient for blending the dark fhadows to the mellow tender hue is made with the fhade teint and little brown oker which should be laid on very paringly with foft light touches for fear of making them dull and heavy if it should be over done we may recover it with the colour it was laid upon weoften fee little bine ufed in the firft teint of white fatin van indecken who was the beft drapery painter we ever had in england did fo and fometimes inftead of the blue he uied blue-black till he found it to be pernicious colcur and was therefore obliged to ufe blue becaufe his middle teint wnich was only of black and white was to very coid that no other colour but blue would make colder teint yet he managed thefe cold colours in all the lights and middle teints to agreeably and to light and eaty was his rouch that we can not help art of painting in ote admiring and may learn fomething from him though he was not fo lucky in his thadows which were generally of heavy dirty hue this was owing to the colours he uted and the method of uting them which will always have fuch an effect when warm or dirty colour is mixed with clean light one for being mixed together they will form dirty colour that muft confequently ap- pear fo in the work bur if his lead or thade teint had been mixed with indian red inftead of the oker and then followed with few light blending touches of the oker teint it would have left them clean and mellow it is the want of the red hue which makes the white fatins appear fo often like pewter blue satinns blue fatin is made of pruffian blue and fine white the beft ground for blue is white for the lights and black and white for the shadows the firft lay of colours for blue is divided into three degrees or teints we should firft make the middle teint of beautiful azure then mix the colour for the lights about middle degree between that and white make the shade teint dark enough for the fhadows in general all the broad lights should be laid with plenty of colour and shaped to character with the middle teint before we lay on any other colours remember the lets colours are mixed the better they will appear and fland for the lights of blue should be managed with as much care as thofe of white fatin next is to follow with the reft of the middle teint and then make out all the fhadows the more we drive the shade tent the better it will art of il the reffects and finithing teints the fhadows should be firengthened and blended with ivory-black and tome of their own colour which will mix with them into tender mellow hue the refiects are made as thofe of white fatin that is with oker and some of the lights which should be per= fecily done as we inrend ii at once painting the thadows when dry may be little improved if there is occafion to alter them with the colours they were made with the pruffian proper to pe ufed is that which looks of the moff beautiful azure before it is ground and the fooner it is ufed after it is ground the better it will work and appear velvet may be painted at once the method is to make out the firft lay with the middle teint and thade teint on which we should lay the high lights with light touches and finith the thadows as we did thofe of the fatin but the neareff imitation of velvet we can make is done by glazing which is to prepare ground or dead-colouring with fuch colours as will when dry bear out and fupport the glazing colour in its higheff perfection the nature of the glazing colour is to be of fine tranfparent quality and ufed fimply with oil only fo that whatever ground it is laid on the whole may appear diffinctly through it the beft ground for blue is made with white and ivory-black the white is for the high lights which with the middle teint and ihade teint makes out the firft lay like metzotinto re- member to make the middle teint lighter in proportion to the glazing becaute that will make it the darker it is often necesfary to cover all but the high lights with glazing do not mean with plenty of oil in the coloury the art of paintinc in otl but laid with less quantity than if it was to he done once only if any of it touch the lights we should wipe it off with clean ray the very high lights should be improved and made of fine white and left to dry the glazing colour is pruffian ground very fine with nut oil and should be laid with large fiffith tool that will drive the colour as occafion requires it is on the laft glazing we should firengthen and finith the thadows the greateft fault in the colouring of draperies is the painting the thadows with flrong glaring colours which deftroy the beauty of the lights this is not only the reverfe of art but of nature whofe beauty always di- minifhes in proportion with the lights for this reafon we should take care to blend and foften the fhadows with fuch friendly colours as will agree with their local character and obfcurity here we may obferve that glazing the middle teint which is made of black and white will not produce colour to blue as if it had been prepared with pruffian and white yet this colour will preferve the beauty of the lights in the higheff per- fection by reafon of its tender obfcure hue when the bluenets of the other would only diminith them this method of glazing the blue is the general rule for all glazing when we are glazing blue the lights may be glazed with ultramarine though all the other parts are done with pruffian this method faves great quantity of that valuable colour and anfwers our purpofe as well as if it had been done with ultramarine though this general method of painting fatins is to make the firft lay of colours with three degrees of teints yet the art of paintine in oil we should underftand in afing them that they pro- duce two more for the mixing of two different colours together on the cloth will make another of middle teint berween them to it is with the lights and middle teints and with the middle and shade teint the firft antwers to the firft teint in white fatin and the laft will confequently be fort of gradating or half shade if the lights and middle teint mix to beautiful clean colour of middle hue between both there will be no occation for colour to go between them as in blue fa- tin but if in mixing they produce teint inclining to dirty warm hue then there muft be another found of tympathizing nature which should be laid between them in order to preferve the beauty of the lights as the firft reint in the white latin for if it was not fo the red in the middle teint would certainly dirty and fpoil the white it is highly neceffary to understand thefe principles of the firft lay of colours in order to have perfect know- ledge of the general rule of colouring on which the principles of painting depend scarlet and crimson light yellow red made of light oker light red and white is the proper ground for fearlet the shadows are indian red and in the darkeft parts mixed with very little black the second painting should be little lighter than we intend the finithing colour mean in proportion to the glzzing which will make it darker the high lights are vermillion and white for fain and velvet and vermillion for cloth the middle teint art of painting in oil vermillion with very little lake or indian red the ihade teint is made with indian red and lake with the addition of little black in the darkeft fhadows the difference between fearlet and crimfon is that the high lights of crimfon are whiter and the middle teint is made darker their refiects are made with light red and ver- million the high lights should be laid and managed in the fame manner as thofe of the blue for fear of dirtying them and fometimes they require to be touched over the second time before we glaze them the more the co- lours of the second painting are drove the eafier and better they may be managed to character but the high lights should have good body of colour and be left with delicate light touch after it is well dry we should finith with glazing the whole with fine lake and improve the reffects and fhadows remember that the fearlet requires but very thin glazing and it is better to glaze the crinfon twice over than lay too much at once painting pine colour there are two different methods of painting pink colour one is by glazing the other is done with body of colours at one painting the fame grounds do for both which should be whitifh colour inclining to yellow for the lights and indian red lake and white for the thadows the second painting for the glazing method is done with the fame colours and little vermillion and whice for the high lights when it is dry glaze it with fine lake and then break and foften the colours into harmony directly the the art of painting in oil other method is to make the high lights with carmine and white the middle teint with lake white and little carmine and the fhadows with lake and in- dian red with little vermillion for the reffections but remember the thadows will require to be broken with some tender obicure teint tellow the ground for yellow should be ayellowifh white for the lights and mixture of the okers for the shadows there are the fame number of teints in the pellow as there are in the white fatin and the method of ufing them is the very fame the lights are made with king yellow ground with clean good drying oil the firft teint is lightoker changed with little of the pearl teint made with the dark shade and white which should be laid and managed as the firft teint in white fatin the middle teint is mixture of the light and brown oker foftened with the pearl teint the shade teint is made with brown pink and brown oker thefe belong to the firftlay the reffects are light oker and fometimes in the warmeff parts mixed with little light red the sha- dows are rrengthened with brown pink and burnt umber thefe colours well managed will produce yellow very like vandykes but if we leave out the king yel- low which is in the high lights only then it will be one of sir peter lely favourite yellows creepy the art of painting in oil proper ground for green is light yellow green which is made of light oker little white and pruffian blue for the lights and the oker brown pink and pruf lian for the hadows the fineft green we have for draperies is made of king yellow pruffian blue and brown pink the high lights are king yellow and very little pruffian the middle tent should have more pruffian and the fhadow teint is made with fome of the middle teint brown pink and more pruffian but the darkeft fhadows are brown pink and little pruffian the lights and middle teint should be managed in the fame manner as thofe of the blues the fhadow teint should be kept entirely from the lights becaute the brown pink that is in it will in mixing dirty them as the black does thofe of the blues remember to allow for their drying little darker and that the king yellow muft be ground with good drying oil for the longer it is drying the more it will change and grow darker and the fooner it is ufed the better it will fland it is proper to have two forts of king yel- low mean one to be very light which will do beft for the high lights of velvet should it be wanted changeable changeaele colours are made with four principal teints viz the high lights middle teint fhade teint and reflecting teint the the art of painting in oil greateff art lies in finding the exact colour of the middle teint becaufe it has more of the general hue of the filk than any of the others the shade teint is of the fame hue with the middle teint though it is dark enough for the fhadows the high lights though often very different from the middle teint should be of clean friendly working colour that will in mixing with it produce reint of clean fympathizing hue the method of painting filks is to make out the folds with the fnade teint and then fill them up in the lights with the middle teint this is what call the firtt lay which should be done to our fatisfaction before we add any other colours and the fiffer the middle teint is ufed the better the high lights may be laid upon it the reflecting teint fails generally upon the gradating half shades and should be laid with tender touches paringly for fear of spoiling the firft lay this method of painting antwers for all the coloured filks as well as changeable with this difference only that the plain colours require not fo much art in match- ing the teints as the changeable do the laft part of the work is the finithing and ffrengthening the fhadows with an obfcure teint little inclining to mellowith hue fuch as will not catch the eye and interrupt the beaury of the lights blace the beft ground for black is light red for the lights and indian red and little black for the fhadows the finithing coloursare for the lights black white and little lake the middle teint has lets white and more art of paintinc in oil more lake and black the shade teint is made of an equal quantity of lake and brown pink with very little black the method of painting black is very different from that of other colours for the principal thing in them is to leave their lights clear and brilliant fo in black it is to keep the fhadows clear and tranfparent therefore we should begin with the fhade teint and glaze over all the fhadows with it next lay in the darkeft fhadows with black and little of the shade teint very correctly after that fill up the whole breadth of lights with the middle reint only all which should be done exactly to the character of the fatin velvet cloth cc cc and then finith with the high lights here we may obferve the ground beingred will bear out and fupport the reds which are ufed in the finithing colours the lake in the lights takes off the cold hue and gives it more beautiful colour if the fhade teint was of any other colour than tranfparent warm hue the hadows would confequently be black and heavy becaufe no other colours can preferve the warm brilliancy which is wanting in the fhadows of the black like lake and brown pink black is of cold heavy nature and always too ftrong for any other colour therefore we should make an allowance in ufing it there will be few reflects in fatin which should be added as thofe of other colours but they should be made of firong colours fuch as burnt umber or brown oker mixed with little shade teint though the grounds which have mentioned for the draperies are abfolutely neceffary for the principal and peareft figures in picture fuch as fingle portrait or f art of painting in oil like yet do not intend them fo for figures which are placed more into the picture.. such as are behind the principal or front figures their grounds should always be fainter in proportion to their local finithing colours linen the colours ufed in linen are the fame as those in white fatin except the firft teint which is made of white and ultramarine athes inflead of the black and mixed to very light bluith teint in the dead colouring we should take particular care that the grounds be laid very white and broad in the lights the fhadows are made with black white and little indian red like the middle teint of white fatin thefe should be left very light and clean in order to fup- port the finithing colours the second painting begins with glazing all the lights with ffiff pencil and fine white only drove bare without ating any oil the fhadows may be fcumbled with poppy oil and fome of the colour they were made of this is the firft lay on which we are to follow with the finithing colours directly the middle teint of white fatin is the beft colour for the general hue of the fhadows with this and white in different degrees we should make out all the parts to character with free light fouches without foftening then with large long- pointed pencil and fine white lay the high lights very nicely with one ftroke after this comes the fine light bluith teint which should be mixed eight and laid in the tender gradations very paringly and lightly without filling them up remember the art of painting in oil the firft lay should be left clear and distinct the more it appears the better it is the overmixing and joining all the colours together which spoils the beauty of the character therefore it is better to let it dry before we add the reffects and finithing teints the method of letting the beautiful clear colour dry before we add the warm reflects and harmonizing teints prevents them from mixing and dirtying each other the principal blending colours ufed in the reffects are the yellow teint green teint and the rofe teint which laft is made of lake indian red and white find glazing the pearl and lead colour with white though it feems to anfwer our purpofe when it is done will cer- tainly fink and be loft in the grounds on which it is laid therefore we should make the dead colouring as white as we intend the finithing colours by reafon they will fink little in proportion to the colour of the cloth which the glazing with pure white only will recover of painting landscapes the principal colours ufed in landicapes are fine flake white white lead or common white fine light oker brownoker brown pink burnt art of painting in oil burnt umber ivory black pruffian blue ultramarine terreverte ii lake indian red vermillion or native cinnabar king yellow the principal teints ufed in landicapes are light oker and white light oker pruffian blue and white light oker and pruffian blue the jame darker terreverte and pruffian blue brown pink and pruffian blue brown pink and brown oker brown pink oker and pruffian blue indian red and white ivory black

little vermillion and fome of the light azure at your difcretion lands the art of paintinc in oil should be painted on fort of tanned leather-colour canvas which is prepared with brown oker white and light red this colour gives warmth to the fhadow colours and is very agreeable and proper forglazing but canvafes and ftrerching frames are to be purchafed ready prepared in feveral different ways ac- cording to the modern practice at the colour-fhops in long acre st. martin lane ec alfo every other material ufed in this delightful ftudy sketcking or rubbing in the defign is the firft work of the picture this should be done with burnt umber drove with drying oil and little oil of turpentine in faint flight fcumbling free manner as we fhade with indian ink and water leaving the colour of the cloth for the lights as we do that of the paper remember in doing it we leave no part of the fhadows fo dark as we intend the firft lay or dead colouring which is to be lighter than the finithing colours and though the foliage of the trees is only rubbed in with faint fort of fcumbling yet the trunks and bodies should be in their proper fhapes with their breadths of light and fhadow all ind of buildings should be done in the fame manner leaving the colour of the cloth for their lights the figures on the fore-ground if they are determined should alfo be ketched in the fame manner and then left to dry of the art of painting in otl deadcolouring ler the firft lay or dead -colouring be without any bright glaring or ftrong dark colours to that the effect is made more to receive and preferve the finifhing colours than to thew them in their firft painting the ky should be done firft then all the diftances and fo work downwards to the middle group and from that to the fore-ground and neareft parts remember all the parts of each group as trees buildings or the like be all painted with the group they belong to the greateff secret in dead-colouring is to find the two colours which ferve for the ground of fhadows in general the thy excepted and the method of uling them with the lights the firft of which is the dark shade with little lake in it the other colour is only burnt umber thefe should be little changed to the natural hue of the objects and then laid and drove with drying oil in the fame manner as we shade with indian ink which is fcumbling kind of glazing and as fuch they should be left for otherwife they will be dark and heavy and therefore would be entirely fpoiled for the finithing glazing both thefe colours mix and fympathize agree- ably with all the lights but should be laid before them when the landicape is defigned begin with the sky which should be laid with good body of colours and left with faint refemblance of the principal clouds and this we should do more in the manner of claro ob- fcuro than with finithing colours the whiter it is left the better it will bear out and fupport them the diftances should art of painting in otl should be made out faint and obicurely with the dark shades and fome of their lights in different degrees and laid fo as beft to find and thew their principal parts as we come more into the middle group we fall by degrees into the burnt umber in the shades all the grounds of the trees should be laid or rubbed in enough only to leave an idea of their shapes and hadows faintly the ground of their fhadows muft be clean and lighter than their finithing colours fuch as will fupport the character and feem eaty to finith orn in painting the lights it is better to incline more to the middle teint than to the very high lights and ob- ferve to leave them with fufficient body of clean colours which will preferve the finithing colours better all which may be done with few teints after this go over the whole with fweetner very lightly which will foften and mix the colours agreeably for finifhing second painting becin with the lky and lay in all the azure and colours of the horizon then foften them after that lay in the general teint of the clouds and finith on it with the high lights and the other teints that are want- ing with light tender touches then foften the whole with fweether very lightly remember the finithing of the fky should be done all at once painting becaufe the tender character of the clouds will not do to well art of painting in oie when the whole is wet obferve that the stiffer the azure and colours of the horizon are laid the better the clouds may be painted upon them the greateft diffances are chieffy made with the colour of the fky and as they grow nearer and darker we should glaze and fcumble the parts very thin with fuch glazing thadow-colours as come neareft to the general hue of the group the objects are in this glazing should be underfiood of darkith hue and that the firft painting or dead colour should be feen through it diftinctly on this lay or ground we should add the finithing colours now fuppoting this glazed ground is properly adapted to the object and place think then it will be eaty to find the other colours which are wanted for the lights and finithings of the fame but in laying them we muft take care that we do not fpoil the glazing therefore we should he very exact in making thofe colours on the pallet and then be fure to lay them with light free touches before proceed any farther it will be proper to fay fomething of the moft uteful glazing colours lake terreverts pruffian blue and brown pink are the four principal the more we manage them like indian ink and the more diffinctly we leave them the better their tranfparent beauty will fland and appear provided we do it with good drying oil after thefe four glazing colours burnt umber is very good glazing warm brown and of great ufe in the broken grounds and neareft parts but the moft agreeable colours for the darkeff fhadows is the dark fhade improved with lake it is fine warm fhade when it is drove with drying oil no colour in the world is to fweet and fympathizing art of paintinc in otl mixes harmonioutly with all the lights as well as the hadows and is charming colour in the trunks and bo- dies of trees and in all kind of buildings we should make out all the ground of the objects with tuch glazing fhadow-colours as feen neareft to the na- tural hue of the object in that fituation but as the prin- cipal glazing colours themfelves are often too ftrong and glaring they should therefore be little changed and foftened with fuch colours as are of near refemblance to themfelves and the objects thus if it is in the dif tances the terreverte and azure which are the pricipal glazing colours may be improved and made lighter with tome of the lky teints and as the diftances come nearer with the purple as we get more into the middle group the terreverte and prullian blue may be changed with some of the green teints fuch as are made without white for white is the destruction of all glazing colours as we approach the firft group there is lets occafion for changing them but the fore-ground and its objects re- quire all the ftrength and force of glazing which the co- lours are capable of producing after this glazing-ground we should follow with rrengthening the fame in the fhadows and darkeft places in fuch manner as will feem eafy to finith which is the firft lay of the second painting the colours that come next for finithing are in the degree of middle teints thefe should be carefully laid over the greateft breadth of lights in fuch manner as not to poil and cover too much of the glazing do it with good body of colour as ftiff as the pencil can agreeably manage to character remember the colours of the middle teint should be of clean beautiful hue accord- g art of painting in oil to thefe methods think it will be eaty to finith all the second painting as we work down from the iky through the middle group as we come to the firft group where all the objects should be perfectly finithed we should finith their under or moft diftant parts before we paint any of the other which appear nearer obferve this method down to the laft and neareft objects of the picture and where it to happens that painting one free over another does not pleafe forbear the fecond until the firft is dry thin near trees of different co- lours will do better if we let the under parts dry before we add the finithing colours the third and last painting ir oiling is neceffary lay the leaft quantity that can be which should be done with fiump-tool or pencil proportioned to the place that is to be oiled to that we may oil no more than is wanted then wipe the whole place that is oiled with piece of filk handkerchief by this method we leave no more oil than is proper for our purpofe when we are going to finith any objects we should remember to ufe great variety of teints very near of the same colour but moft of all when we are finifhng frees his gives richnets to the colouring and pro- duces harmony find by experience the greens will fade the art of paintinc in oil and grow darker therefore it is highly neceffary to improve and force them by exaggerating the lights and making an allowance in uling them to much the lighter for the same reafon we should take great care that we do not overcharge and fpoil the beauty of the glazing for if we do it will be dull and heavy and therefore will confequently grow darker the merhod of painting near trees is to make the firft lay very near to nature though not quite to dark but more in the degree of middle teint and follow it with ttrengthening the fhadows then the middle teints and laft of all lay the high lights and finithing colours but all this can not be done as it should be at once paint- ing therefore the beft way is to do no more than the firft lay with the faint lhadows and leave it to dry then begin with improving the middle teints and tha- dows and let them dry the third and laft work is adding all the lights and finifhing colours in the beft manner we are able this method of leaving the firft and second parts to dry fepa- rately not only makes the whole much eafier and more agreeable but leaves the colours in the greateft perfection becaufe moft of the work may be done with fcumbling and glazing and some parts without oiling the lights alfo may be laid with better body of colour which will not be mixed and fpoiled with the wet ground what have faid of trees anfwers the fame to all kinds of shrubs and buthes the figures in the landicape are the laft work of the picture thofe in the fore-ground should be done firft and thofe in the diftances should be done next for after the figures in the firft and farcheff group are painted think art of painting in oil it will be much eafier to find the proportions of thofe in the middle parts of the picture and we should obferve that the thadows of the figures should be of the same hue or colour with thofe of the group or place they are in finis
