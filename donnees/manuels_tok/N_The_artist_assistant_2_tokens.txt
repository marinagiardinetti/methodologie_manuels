by the makers or wholesale dealers by adding chalk or powdered tale which may be seen by comparing pure piece with fuspected one as the fraud will appear by the difference of the weight but to prove it more exactly use the following means take an ounce of the white lead suspected and mix it well with about half an ounce of pearl affies or of any fixed alkaline salt and about quarter of an ounce of charcoal dust and having put them into crucible give them strong heat the lead will by this means be re- duced to its metallic state and being weighed will shew by what it may fall short of the weight of an ounce the proportion of the adulteration about à tenth part being allowed for the corroding acid which formed part of the white lead calcined ot burnt hartshorn take horn or bones and burn them in any common fire till they become coal or are caleined to some de¬ gree of whitenefs then having freed them carefully from any coal or filth reduce them to gross powder and put them upon

levigating it well on stone and washiing it over it is serviceable in miniature painting troy white or spanish white may be used in water colours from the following pre¬ paration take pound of chalk

the chalk once in six or eight hours wasni then the chalk again over till it be rendered perfectly fine and pour off as much of the water as can be sepa¬ rated from the chalk by that means taking off the re- mainder of the dissolved allum by several renewed quan- tities of fresn water aster the last water is poured off put the chalk into one of the cullender filters with linen cloth over the paper

from burning oil in confined place and collecting the soot it mixes well either with oil or water and is esteem- ed as the principal black in all nicer kinds of painting take plates chips or shavings of ivory and soak them in hot linseed oil or iffilings are to be more easily procured they may be used moistened with the hot oil put them into à vessel which will bear the fire covering them with fort of lid made of clay and sand which should be dried and the cracks repaired besore the vessel be put into the fire procure this vessel to be placed in tobacco-pipe-maker ’ or potter ’ furnace or any other fuch fire and let it remain there during one of their heats when it shall be taken out the ivory will be burnt properly and must be asterwards thoroughly well levigated on the stone with water or it should indeed to have it perfectly good be also washed over it is not so much used as lamp black owing perhaps to its drying slowly in oil or to the frequent adulterations with charcoal dust which renders it of blue cast other- wife it is if genuinely prepared from the ivory full clear black and extremely serviceable indian ink the true indian ink is imported from china and is of consistence when dissolved with water extremely well adapted to the pencil it is much used in miniature paint- ing and drawings of small kinds there is fort frequent- ly sold for it made as follows take of isinglass six ounces reduce it to size by gissolving it over the fire in double its weight of water take then of spanishi liquorice one ounce and dissolve it also in double its weight of water and grind up with it an ounce of ivory black prepared as above directed in add this mixture to the size while hot and stir the whole together till all the ingredients be thoroughly incorporated then evaporate away the water in bal- neo mariae and cast the remaining composition into lead¬ ed moulds greased or make it up in any other form the preceding are the chief of the substances there will be occasion to mention in drawing and painting but crayou and enamel colours will be treated of in their places those persons who are accustomed to paint in oils generally purchase their colours ready prepared in bladders compleat set of which with pallette and requisites for painting may be procured at the colour-shops compleat sets of water-colours are also sold in boxes with peneils for miniature painting drawing the price from eight shillings to three guineas as the oil colours prepared in bladders if they are kept long become useless and as those who are not professed artists seldom paint so much as to use them without great waste it became à desideratum that some method should be found to render them more durable -this mr. blackmen has accomplished and at the same time has made them portable that they can be used with equal ease with the common water-colour cakes we give the method of preparing them from vol xii of the transactions of the society for the encouragement of arts manufactures and commerce method of preparing blackmans oil-colour cakes take of the clearest gum mastick reduced to fine powder four ounces of spirit of turpentine one pint mix them together in bottle stirring them frequently till the mastick is dissolved if it is wanted in haste some heat may be applied but the solution is best when made cold let the colours to be made use of be the best that can be procured taking care that by washing they are brought to the greatest degree of finenefs possible when the colours are dry grind them on hard close stone porphyry is the best in spirit of turpentine adding small quantity of the mastick varnissi let the colours so ground become again dry then prepare the composition for forming them into cakes in the following manner procure some of the purest and whitest spermaceti you can obtain melt it over gentle fire in clean earthen vessel when fluid add to it one third of its weight of pure poppy oil and stir the whole well together these things being in readiness place the stone on which your colours were ground on frame or support and by means of charcoal fire under it make the stone warin next grind your colour sine with muller then adding à sufficient quan¬ tity of the mixture of poppy oil and spermaceti work the whole together with the muller to proper consistence take then piece of fit size for the cake you intend to make roll it into ball putit into mould press it and it will be complete when these cakes are to be used they must be rubbed down in poppy or other oil or in mixture of spirit of turpentine and oil as may best suit the convenience or intention of the artist of painting painting is the art of representing to the eyes by means of figures and colours every object in nature that is discernable by the sight and of expressing the various emotions of the mind by an admirable effort of human genius it offers to our vision every thing which is most valuable in the universe its empire extends over every age and country it presents to us the heroic deeds of ancient times as well as those with which we are more conversant and distant objects equally with those we daily see in this respect it may be considered as supplement to nature which gives us only view of present objects the painter who is distinguished for noble and profound concentions who conveys to the spectators the sentiments with which he is himself inspired who animates them with his genius and makes lasting impression on their minds this artist is poet and worthy to share in the glories of homer but if he seek only to please or astonisn by the illusion of colours he must rest contented with the secondary merit of flattering the eye with variety of tints or making an industrious assemblage of multiplicity of objects the poet or the painter who excel in their profefsions deserve all the respect due to genius they are of the number of those men whom nature sparing of her best gifts grants but occasionally to the inhabitants of the earth if they are sublime they elevate the human race if tney are agreeable only they excite those sweet sensations necessary to our happiness of the schools school in the sine arts denominates class of artists who have learned their art from certain master either by receiving his instructions or studying his works all the painters which europe has produced since the renovation of the arts are classed under the following schools the school of florence of rome of venice the lombard french german flemisn dutch and englisn schools the school of florence is remarkable for greatnefs for attitudes seemingly in motion for à certain dark severity for an expression of strength by which grace is perhaps excluded and for character of design approaching to the gigantic it can not be denied that the productions of this school although overcharged possess an ideal majesty which elevates human nature above mortality the tuscan artists satisfied with commanding admiration seem to have considered the art of pleasing as beneath their notice cimabue noble florentine born in the year the first who after the destruction of the roman empire practised the art of painting which he learned from some greek workmen who were employed by the tuscan government his pictures were as may be ima¬ gined in an ordinary stile but they received the applause of his countrymen so little practised was he in his art that in his pictures to prevent the possibility of mistake in the judgment of the spectator respecting the subject inscriptions were added with sentences coming out of the mouths of the persons represented in them to cimabue succeeded giotto his disciple who when shepherd ’ boy was found by him drawing the figure of shieep upon stone he soon become more celebrated than his master and is accounted one of the founders of the florentine school from this time the number of artists encreased so rapidly that in they established society under the protection of st. luke towards the commencement of the sisteenth century the works of the florentines possessed something of gran- deur life and expression and massacio is mentioned as the first who gave force and relief to his pictures but michael angelo and leonardo de vinci were the glory of the school of florence the former superior in grandeur in boldness of conception and knowledge of design the latter in all the amiable parts of the art leonardo pos¬ sessed of fine imagination and full of sensibility devoted himself in painting to express the affections of the soul and if in this sublime branch of the art he was afterwards surpassed by raphael he had at least the glory not only of surpassing all the painters who went before him but of pursuing path which none of them had attempted mi- chael angelo lefs formed to experience sweet affections than violent pafsions sought in nature what the strength of man might accomplisn not that which constitutes beauty better acquainted with anatomy than any other artist he seems too eager to display his knowledge of it and to have forgotten that the muscles are less visible in children females and young men than in confirmed and vigorous manhood you never perceive says mengs muscle at rest and although he knew admirably well how to place them their action is very frequently inconsistent with their situation he never says sir joshua reynolds attempted the lesser elegances and graces of the art and if any man had right to look down upon the lower accom- plishiments as beneath his attention it was certainly michael angelo artist ’ assistant roman school has exceeded every other in beauty of form grandeur stile and just exprefsion this is to be attributed to the superior advantages they enjoyed in having access to those precious remains of ancient art which rome in its prosperity drew from declining greece or which were executed in its own bosom by grecian artists this school was altogether devoted to the principal parts of the art to those which require genius and vast conceptions and was no farther occupied with colours than was necessary to establisn difference between painting and sculpture or rather between painting varied with colours and claro obscuro at the head of this school is placed raphael sanzio born at urbino in the early part of his lise he had accustomed hiinself to copy nature with great exactness but without being solicit- ous about the choice or perhaps ignorant that any choice was necessary when he saw the works of leonardo de vinci and michael angelo they gave to his genius new direction he perceived that there was something more in the art of painting than simple imitation of truth but the works of those masters were not sufficient to enable him to make the best choice and he continued in uncertainty till he saw at rome the works of the ancients then he perceived that in imitating them he had only to follow the natural impulse of his genius his design is admirable-he excelled in representing the character of philosophers apostles and other figures of that kind the greeks were superior to him in ideal figures but if he did not succeed in embellishing nature in the same high degree he saw at least and imitated her in whatever was expressive and beautiful the greeks says mengs sailed with majesty between earth and heaven raphael walked with propriety on the earth composition is in general says the same authorl of two kinds raphael ’ is the expressive kind the other the- atrical or picturesque which consists of an agreeable dispo- sition of the figures lanfranc was the inventor of the last and after him pietro de cortona the preference is given to raphael because reason presides over all his works or at least the greatest part of them he never allowed himself in common ideas nor ever sussered his accessary figures to turn the attention from the principal object of the piece the excellency of raphael says sir oshua reynolds lay in the propriety beauty and majesty of his characters his judicious contrivance of composition correctness of drawing purity of taste and the skilful accommodation of other men ’ conceptions to his own purpose the school of venice is the child of nature the venetian painters not having under their eyes like the romans the remains of antiquity were destitute of the means of forming just idea of the beauty of forms and of expression they copied without choice the forms of nature but were chiefly delighted with the beauties which presented themselves in the mixture and variety of colours colouring was their chief object and they endeavoured by the agreement and opposition of colours and by the contrast of light and shade to produce à vigor- ous effect to demand and fix the attention in this they succeeded dominico who was the second italian artist who painted in oil had educated before he quitted venice giacomo bellino who had two sons gentile and giovanni both of whom were painters the latter contributed much to the progress of his art in painting constantly in oil and after nature giorgione and titian his scholars are considered as the founders of the venetian school giorgione distinguished himself by better taste in de- signing than his master but he chiessy surpassed hiin in colouring he died in his zad year tiziano vecelli better known by the name of titian was instructed in the school of bellino to copy nature in the most servile manner but when he had seen the works of giorgione he began to study the ideal in colouring the truth of history is not to be expected in hipniings or in those of the artists of the same school he paig little attention to the consistance of scene to the costume to expression adapted to the subject or finally to the accom¬ modation of parts which characterise the works of those who have studied the ancients the artists of the florentine and roman schools painted most commonly in water-colours or in fresco and instead of nature they finished their work from their sirst sketches titian painted in oil and finisned from the objects in nature and this practice joined to his exquisite talents gave the greatest truth to his colours his being portrait painter was also of advantage to him as colourist in this department he was accustomed to the colours of nature in carnations and draperies he was landfkape painter and here he also took the colours from nature titian has in general little expression in his pictures and he sometimes introduces figures which augment the coldness of the piece for if it be true that heads even in historical painting ought to be studied from nature it is true also that individual nature should not be presented but one general and ideal the painter fails in the effect which he ought to produce if when he represents achilles hector and cæsar his personages are familiar to our obser- vation the distinguishing characteristies of the lombard school are grace an agreeable taste for design without great cor- rection mellowness of pencil and beautisul mixture of colours antonio allegri called corregio was the father and greatest ornament of this school he began by imitating nature alone but as he was chiefly delighted with the graceful he was careful to purisy his design -he made his figures elegant and large and varied his outlines by fre- quent undulations but he was not always pure and correct corregio painted in oil kind of painting susceptible of the greatest delicacy and sweetnefs and as his character led him to cultivate the agreeable he gave pleasing cap- tivating tone to all his pictures he sought transparent colours to represent shades conformable to nature and adopted manner of glazing which actually rendered his shadows more obscure it is chiesly in this that he deserves to be imitated for his lights are too clear and somewhat heavy and his fleshy parts are not sufficiently transparent harmony and grace are connected together and on this account corregio is excellent also in harmony as the delicacy of his taste suffered him not to employ strong oppositions he naturally became great master in this part which chiesly consists of easy gradations from one extreme to another delicate taste in colours perfect knowledge of the claro obscuro the art of uniting light to light and shade to snade together with that of de- taching objects from the ground inimitable grave and perfect harmony were the qualities which distinguished corregio from all painters and placed him near the head of his profefsion the carracci lewis augustin and hannibal formed what is called the second lombard school which is fre- quently distinguished by the name of the school of bologna lewis was the master of the other two he had studied the works of titian and paolo veronese of andrea del sarto of corregio and of julio romano but he chiesly endea voured to imitate the manner of corregio hannibal sluctuated between corregio and titian augustin their rival in painting had his mind cultivated by learning and devoted part of his time to poetry music and other many exercises these three painters often employed their talents upon the same work and their united labours seemed to be animated with the same spirit they established an academy at bologna called ’ academia degli desiderosi but it was afterwards known by the name of the academy of the carracci in this school was taught the art of constructing models perspective and anatomy lessons were given on the beautiful proportions of nature on the best manner of using colours and on the principles of light and snade the academy separated on hannibal ’ going to rome to adorn the gallery of the cardinal farnese the works of the carraci are often from the resemblance of their manner confounded together nevertheless each of them has decided character distinct from the other two lewis had less fire but more grace and grandeur augustin had more spirit in his conception and more pleasantness in his execution hannibal is characterized by boldness by design more profound by an exprefsion more lucky and by an execution more solid lodovico carracci says sir joshina reynolds appears to me to approach nearest to perfection his unaffected breadth of light and shadow the simplicity of colouring which holding its proper rank does not draw aside the least part of the attention from the subject and the solemn essect of that twilight which seems diffused over hie pictures appears to me to correspond with grave and dignified subjects better than the more artificial brilliancy of sunshine which en¬ lightens the pictures of titian hannibal is esteemed by the best judges as model for beauty and design those who blame him for becoming less colourist at rome than he was at bologna ought to recollect that it is his performances at rome which have chiefly secured his reputation severe critics have maintained that his design is too little vaired in the figures that he excels only in male beauty and that in imitating ancient statues he excites some resemblance but without arriving at that sublimity of ideas and of stile which cha¬ racterise the ancients the success of hannibal and the reputation which he acquired have been pernicious to the art his successors deluded by these considerations have made him the object of their imitation without ascending to the sources from which he derived his knowledge and which they never could equal the result has been that instead of be¬ coming equal to hannibal they have often copied his imperfections the french school has varied so much under different masters that it is difficult to characterise it some of its artists have been formed on the florentine and lombard manner others on the roman others on the venetian and few have distinguisned themselves by manner which may be called their own in speaking in general terms of this school it appears to have no peculiar character and it can only be distinguishied by its aptitude to imitate easily any impression and it may be added speaking still in general terms that it unites in moderate degree the different parts of the art without excelling in any one of them it is equally dissicult to determine the progress of painting in france miniature painting and painting on glafs were early cultivated in that country and in these two kinds the italians had often recourse to french artists cousin painter on glafs and portrait painter was the first who establishied any kind of reputation in france he was correct but possessed very little elegance of design painting for some time encouraged by francis the first fell into state of languor from which it was not recovered till the reign of louis xiii jaques blanchard formed in the venetian school and called the french titian flourissi- ed about this period but as he left no pupils to perpetuate his manner he must be regarded as à single good artist and not as à founder of the french school in the same manner poussin whom they call the raphael of france educated no pupils and formed no school his stile and manner of painting are described by sir joshua reynolds as simple careful pure and correct no works of any modern have so much the air of antique painting as those of poussin his best performances have certain dryness of manner which seems perfectly correspondent to that ancient simplicity which distinguisn his stile in the latter part of his lise he changed from this manner into one much soster and richer where there is greater union between the figures and the ground his favorite subjects were ancient fables and no painter was ever better quali¬ fied to paint such subjects as he was eminenily fkilled in the knowledge of the ceremonies customs and habits of the ancients and well acquainted with the different cha¬ racters which those who invented them gave their allegorical figures poussin more admired than imitated had no manner of insluence in forming the french school simon vouet had this honour because his pupils in the happy age of the arts in france conferred on it the greatest splendour vouet was man of distinguished abilities but the school which he erected would have had no continuance if his scholars had pursued his manner of painting he had kind of grandeur and facility but his design was false with regard to colours and without any idea of exprefsion he had the merit of destroying the insipid taste which reigned in france and pointing the way to better if vouet laid the foundation of the french school le brun finishied the edifice he had noble conception and fruitful imagination on no occasion was he inferior to the vast compositions he undertook few painters have united greater number of essential qualities and access- ories of the art —-he drew well but his design was far from being so elegant as that of raphael or so pure as that of domenichino and it was less lively than that of hannibal carracci whom he had taken as model in drapery he followed the roman school but in this part he was not equal to the painter of urbino he had studied the expression of the affections of the soul but after observing the general characters and establishing the prin- cipal traits of expression he thought he had reached the whole extent of this subject which is so infinitely extended he was delighted with great compositions and he gave them life animation and variety but he wanted the vigour and inspiration of raphael his compositions are founded on philosophical principles but those of raphael are created le brun thought well raphael poussin and le sueur thought most profoundly le brun had eleva- tion but he was not elevated like raphael to the sublime in colouring le brun did not follow the painters of the venetian school the sweet attractions and strong and solid colours of the schools of rome and lombardy seem rather to have been the object of his imitation and from them also he learned an easy agreeable and bold manage¬ ment of the pencil eustach le sueur was the cotemporary and rival of le brun and no painter approached nearer to raphael in the art of drapery or in disposing the solds in the most artful and the noblest manner his design was in general more slender than that of raphael but like his it was form- ed on the model of the ancients like raphael he re- presented with art and precision the affections of the soul like him he varied the air of the head according to the condition the age and the character of his personages and like him he made the different parts of every figure contribute to the general effect his intention in compos¬ ing was to express his subject not to make shining con¬ trasts or beautiful groups of figures not to astonish and bewitch the spectator by the deceitsul pomp of theatrical scene or the splendour of the great machine his tones are delicate his tints harmonious and his colours though not so attractive as those of the schools of venice and flanders are yet engaging they steal peaceably on the soul and fix it without distraction on the parts of the art superior to that of colouring if le sueur had lived longer or if like le brun he had been employed under court fond of the arts and of learning to execute the great works of the age the french school would have adopted à disserent and better manner the noble heauty of his heads the simple majesty of his draperies the lightness of his design the propriety of his expreffion and attitudes and the simplicity of his general disposition would have formed the character of this school the deceitful pomp of theatrical decoration would have been more lately introduced or perhaps would never have appeared and paris might have been the counter part to rome but as le brun by an accidental concurrence of favour- able circumstances was the faffiionable painter to be em¬ ployed or rewarded it was necessary to imitate his manner and as his imitators possessed not his genius his faults be¬ came not only current but more deformed the french school not long ago changed its principles and if they follow the road which they have marked out for themselves they have the chance of becoming the most riged observers of the laws imposed on the greek artists the count de caylus pupil of buchardon who by his rank and fortune had the means of encouraging the imitators of the ancients and of the masters of the i century first sormed the design of restoring pure taste to the art of painting he was seconded by the talents of vien an artist who had only occaston to have his lessons and his example laid before him in this manner commenced revolution so much the more wonderful as it was scarcely ever known that any nation substituted system of simple and rigid excellence in place of à salse and glittering taste the history of all nations on the contrary discovers à gradual progrefs froin à rude beginning to perfection and afterwards to an ir- remediable decay the french have the prospect of stopping short in this ordinary course they have begun in manner which promises success and the best consequences may be expected from the study of those master pieces of ancient art with which the capital the of french republic is ornamented and which to the honour of the government are open to the inspection of every one it is almost need- less to mention that these invaluable works are the most capital productions of art which were formerly at florence rome turin naples and the cities in the austrian netherlands in germany there can hardly he said to be school as it is continuation of single artists who derived their manner from different sources of originality and imitation there were some german painters of eminence when the art emerging from its barbarous state first began to be cultivated in europe as they were totally unacquainted with the ancients and had scarcely access to the works of their contemporaries in italy they copied nature alone with the exception of somewhat of that stisfness which forms the gothic manner but this is by no means the case with their successors part of whom were educated in flanders and part in italy for if mengst or deitrich were com- prehended in this school there would be nothing peculiar to its manner discovered in their works it is therefore necessary to confine our observations to the more ancient german painters in whom the gothic stile is conspicuous albert durer was the first german who corrected the bad taste of his countrymen he excelled in engraving as well as painting his genius was fertile his compositions varied his thoughts ingenious and his colours brilliant his works though numerous were finished with great exact- ness but as he owed every thing to his genius and as works of inferior merit were by the salse taste of the times preferred to his it was impossible for him altogether to avoid antonio raphael mengs was born at ausig in bohemia his first patron was augustus id king of poland and his last and most generous was charles king of spain his grand work was the apotheosis of st. eusebius at rome andhis most beautiful picture that of the nativity at madrid there was à great rivalsnip existing between reynolds and mengs who possessed little original genius and was scrupuluus if not servile copyist he was coldly correct and the greater plagiary in the chamber of painters at florence are the portraits of mengs and reynolds by themselves strongly characterised by the dignified but sullen air of the one and the universal in telligence and liberality of the other the faults of his predecessors he is blamed for stiffnefs and aridity in his outlines sor little taste or grandeur in his expression for ignorance of the costume of ærial per- spective and of gradation of colours but he had studied lineal perspective architecture and fortification john holbein nearly cotemporary with albert durer painted in oil and water-colours he excelled chiesly in history and in portrait painting his colours are fresni and brilliant and his works highly finishied but in his historical subjects his draperies are not in so good taste as those of albert durer the flemish school is recommended to the lovers of the art by the discovery or at least the first practice of oil painting it has been generally attributed to john van eyck who was accustomed to varnisn his distemper pictures with composition of oils which was pleasing on account of the lustre it gave them in the course of his practice he came to mix his colours with oil instead of water which he found rendered them brilliant without the trouble of varnishing from this and subsequent experiments arose the art of painting in oils of which wonderful dis- covery van mandes gives à very particular account but the truth of it is now very much questioned and it is even proved that this method of painting was discovered long besore the time of jolin van eyck it is admitted that joln and his brother eubert were the sirst who brought it into general practice by shewing the excellence of which it was susceptible their own paintings having acquired all over europe great reputation for the softnefs and delicaey of their colours the attention of the italian painters was soon excited and antonio de massina persormed à journey into flanders sor the express purpose of acquiring the con¬ sidence of john van eyck and of discovering the secret john of bruges was the sounder of painting as profeffion in flanders peter paul rubens was the founder of the art this extraordinary person produced an im- mense number of works he excelled equally in historical ortrait and landskape painting in fruits flowers and in animals he invented and executed with the greatest facility the works of rubens were destitute of that soft inspiration productive of sweet and pleasant effects so con¬ spicuous in the works of raphael but he possessed that prightlinefs of genius and strength of mind which are ever ready to burst forth in wonderful and astonishing effects his figures appear to be the exact counterpart of his conceptions and their creation nothing more than simple act of the will his chief merit consists in colour- ing though in this branch of the art he has not equalled titian he is the first among painters eminent for pomp and majesty the first among those who spedk to the eye and the power of the art is often by him carried almost to enchantment rubens says sir joshiua reynolds is remarkable in¬ stance of the same mind being seen in all the various parts of the art the whole is so much of piece that one can fcarce be brought to believe but that if any one of them had been more correct and perfect his works would not be so compleat as they appear if we should allow greater urity and correctuess of drawing his want of simplicity in composition colouring and drapery would appear more grofs the flemisn school of which rubens is the greatest master is remarkable for great brilliancy of colours and the magie of the claro obscuro to these may be joined prosound design which is yet not founded on the most beautiful forms composition possessed of grandeur certain air of noblenefs in the figures strong and natural exprefsions in short kind of national beauty which is neither copied from the ancients nor from the roman or lombard schools but which deserves to please and is capable of pleasing to speak in general terms and without regarding great number of exceptions the dutch school carries none of the above qualities to great perfection except that of colouring far from excelling in the beauty of heads and forms they seem to delight in the exact imitation of the lowest and most ignoble their subjects are derived from the tavern the smith ’ shop and from the vulgar amusements of the rudest peasants the exprefsions are sufficiently marked but it is the expression of passions which debase instead of ennobling human nature it must be acknowledged at the same time that the dutch painters have succeeded in several branches of the art if they have chosen low objects of imitation they have represented them with great exactness and truth must always please if they have not succeeded in the most difficult parts of the claro obscuro they at least excel in the most striking such as is in light confined in narrow space night illuminated by the moon or by torches and the light of smith ’ sorge the dutch understand the gradations of colours they have no rivals in landskape painting considered as the faithful representation of particular scene but they are far from equalling titian poussin claude lorrain who have carried to the greatest perfection the ideal landskape and whose pictures instead of being the topographical representation of certain places are the combined result of every thing beautiful in their imagination or in nature the dutch distinguisn in so great estimation are some of the landskapes by this master that two pictures known by the name of the altiere claudes from their having been long in the altiere palace at rome were lately purchased by mr. beckford for the almost incredible sum of zooo guineas themselves by their perspective by their clouds sea scenes animals fruits slowers and infects and they excel in miniature painting in short every thing which requires faithful imitation colour and à nice pencil is well exe- cuted by the dutch painters holland has also produced history painters as octavius van been and vander hilst the rival of vandyke but it is not in the works of these artists that we find the character of the dutch school neither is the origin of their style to be derived from the the works of lucas of leyden though from the time he flourished viz about the end of the fifteenth century he may be considered as the patriarch of the dutch school lucas painted in oil in water-colours and on glass and the kinds of his painting were history landfkape and portrait if miniature painting be considered as character of the dutch school cornelius polembourg may be regarded as the father of it he possessed the colour delicacy of touch and disposition of the claro obscuro which chiesly distin- guish this school and if any thing is to be added it is want of correctness in his design but if the choice of low figures is its chief characteristic this is to be found in the greatest perfection in the works of the celebrated rembrandt vanryn and it is the more offensive in this artist as his compositions frequently re- quired an opposite choice of figures as his father was miller near leyden his education must altogether have depended on the exertion of great talents and the study of nature he studied the grotesque figure of dutch peasant or the servant of an inn with as much application as the greatest masters of italy would have studied the apollo of belvidere or the venus de medicis this was not the manner of elevating himself to the noble conceptions of raphael but it was acquiring the imitation of truth in vulgar painting rembrandt says mr. descamps may be compared to the great artists for colour delicacy of touch and claro obscuro he delighted in great oppositions of light and shade and he seems to be chiesly attentive to this branch of the art his workshop was occasionally made dark and he received the light by hole which fell as he chose to direct it on the place which he desired to be enlightened his painting is à kind of magie no artist knew better the effects of different colours mingled together nor could better distin- guisn those which did not agree from those which did he placed every tone in its situation with so much exactness and harmony that he needed not to mix them and so destroy what may be called the slower and fresnness of the colours such is the power of genius that rembrandt with all his faults and they are enormous is placed among the greatest artists by mr. descamps who had attentively exa- mined his works and was himself an artist john de laer miniature painter and who made choice of his subjects from common life deserves à distin- guished place in the dutch school he painted hunting- scenes the attacks of robbers public festivals landikapes and sea views he had correct design and employed vigorous and lively colouring van-ostade although born at lubeck gerrard dow metzu miris wouvermans berghem and the celebrated painter of slowers van huysum belong to the dutch school the greater part of the schools of which we have treated have no longer any existence italy alone had four schools and there only remain at present à very sew italian artists known to foreigners the school of rubens is in vain sought for in flanders if the dutch school still exists it is not known beyond the precincts of holland mengs german artist has rendered himself famous in our days but it was in italy that he chiefly improved his talents and exercised his art dietrich another german has made himself known to strangers but two solitary artists do not form school the englisn school has been formed in our own times it is connected with the royal academy in london insti- tuted in but although as school it did not exist before that time yet ever since the revival of the arts and the consequent encouragement given to them by the fovereigns of europe england has possessed portrait painters of ability and perhaps it has been owing only to the re- markable partiality of the nation for this branch of the art that the more noble one of history painting has been neglected hans holbein is ranked by du piles among the german painters yet he painted his most celebrated works in england he was the first painter of eminence encouraged by henry the eighth who excited by the fame which his cotemporaries francis and charles had gained as pa¬ trons of the arts employed him and invited titian to eng- land but merely as portrait painter -- whether the reward offered was not thought adequate to his merit or for some other cause perhaps the knowledge that his talents for historical design would be depreciated he firmly re- jected the overture the public works of holbein in england are four only as enumerated by mr. walpole which are rather groups of portraits than history nothing could be more unsavourable to female beauty than the dress of those times holbein ’ men are there- fore much more characteristic than his ladies even his anna bulleyne is deficient in loveliness as he pourtrayed her in his likeness of anne of cleves he is said to have sacrificed truth to slattery yet the original which is in the possession of mr. barret of lee in kent is below mediocrity there are in his majesty ’ collection feries of portraits of persons of quality in the reign of henry the eighth sketched upon paper with crayons probably taken al single sitting they have lately been engraved by bartolozzi with all the strength and spirit of the originals holbein was as celebrated in miniature as in oil colours he made great number of designs for engravers sculp- tors and jewellers he died at his residence at white- hall in those lodgings which were afterwards the paper- offices the fame of lsaac oliver who flourished about the latter end of the reign of elizabeth as miniature painter is well known he received some instructions from fre- derico zucchero who was in england at that time where among other portraits he painted that of the unfortunate mary queen of scots oliver drew well and made some admirable copies from the italian masters greatly as lsaac was celebrated he was afterwards exceeded by his son peter who drew portraits of king james the first prince henry prince charles and most of the court about this period cornelius janson fkilful portrait painter came to england from amsterdam and painted the king and many of the nobility but his merits being eclipsed by vandyke of whom he was jealous and the civil war breaking out he fled from england cornelius janson was remarkable for high finisning in his draperies many of which are black which seems to add roundness relief and spirit to his figures and carnations he is said to have used ultra marine in the black colours as well as in the carnations to which may be attributed their lustre even at this day the duke of beaufort has capital portrait of janson by himself but one of his best perform- ances is the rushiout family at northwick in worcester- shire daniel mytens was popular painter in the reign of james and charles —he had studied under rubens and was for some time principal painter to chadles but was deprived of his place when vandyke arrived in england charles however continued his pension during lise vandyke had his first instructions from vaubalen of antwerp but he soon found in rubens master every way more suited to direct his genius and to ma¬ ture that consummate taste which he very early showed marks of possessing under the instructions of rubens he acquired such sxill in his art that the portrait of his master ’ wife which he painted whilst he was yet his disciple is esteemed one of the best pictures in the low countries he painted for his master two admirable pieces one repre- senting christ seized in the garden and the other the crowning him with thorns when he left rubens he travelled into italy and on his return having established his reputation as one of the first painters of the age he was invited to england where he was knighted by charles and married one of the handsomest ladies of the court the daughter of lord ruthven earl of gowry towards the latter end of his lise he went to france in hopes of being employed in the great gallery of the louvre but not succeeding he returned to england and proposed to the king to make cartoons for the banqueting-house at whitehall but his demand of so ooo being judged unreasonable whilst the king was treating with him for less sum the gout and other distempers put an end to his lise dobson had merited from charles the title of the english tintoret besore his premature death in at the age of only thirty-six years he was the father of the english school of portrait painting and though sometimes unequal had much the manner of his master vandyke he resided much at oxford and left there the portraits of himself and wife and of sir tradescant and his friend zythepsa the quaker in the staircase of the ashmolean museum dobson sometimes painted history his decolla- tion of st. john at wilton and the astronomer and his family at blenheim are amongst those which are most known and admired lely was in the former part of his life à landskape painter but was induced to practice portrait painting perhaps from the reputation and emolument which its pro¬ fessors obtained in england lely was chiefly celebrated for painting females and it is sometimes objected to him that his faces have too great à fimilarity of expreffion the languishing air the drowsy sweetness peculiar to him- self and the sleepy eye that spoke the melting soul is found in nearly all the pictures of females by this painter his crayon drawings are admirable he drew the por- trait of charles when prisoner at hampton-court charles i knighted him and made him his principal kneller was the fafhiionable artist in the reigns of james ii and william among an infinity of portraits there are some which bear the marks of excellence dr. wallis the mathematician and lord crew both for colouring and exprefsion are in great style the latter was admired by sir joshiua reynolds sor the air of nobility it possesses kneller is said to have drawn ten crowned heads viz four kings of england and three queens the czar of muscovy the emperor charles and louis xiv notwithstanding the negligence which is manisest in most of his works which arose from the desire of gain his genius is very apparent in his lise-time he received the praise of his contemporaries but the connoisseurs of the prefent age by no means allow that the praises of pope were merited speaking of kneller he says- ee whose art was nature and whose pictures thought but hoiv sew of them deserve the compliment thornhill painted several great works his fresco paint- ings in the dome of st. paul ’ and the painted hall at greenwich are too well known to need deseribing his copies of the cartoons of raphael which were purchased in for guineas have been presented to the royal academy by the duke of bedford richardson was portrait painter of eminence to his treatise on painting we are indebted for the greatest ornament to the art sir joshua reynolds sixed the destination of his mind on the prosession occasioned by the accidental reading of that work pope praised jervais but without discernment those beauties which were to ee bloom in his colours for thousand years ’ are now faded and unnoticed hudson was the best pupil of richardson the merit of sir joshiua rey- nolds as portrait painter can not be attributed to hudson ’ instructions since his manner seems entirely his own sir joshiua was born at plimpton in devonshire in the year his relations still preserve some frontispieces to the lives of plutarch as specimens of his early predilection for his art and tlie promise he gave of becoming eminent in it he became pupil to hudson about who amonstg other advice he gave him recommended him to copy guerchino ’ drawings which he did with such still that many of them are preserved in the cabinets of collectors as the original of that master about the year he went to rome to prosecute his studies where he remained nearly two years and employed himself rather in making studies from than copying the works of the great painters he amused himself with painting caricatures particularly one of all the englisn then at rome in the disserent attitudes of raphael ’ celebrated school of athens on his return he resided in newport-street but shortly after re- moved to leicester-fields where he continued till the time of his death an ingenious critic thus delineates sir joshua ’ professional character sir joshua reynolds was most assuredly the best portrait painter that this age has pro- duced he possessed something original in his manner which distinguished him from those painters who preceded him his colouring was excellent and his distribution of light and shadow so generally judicious and varied that it most clearly shewed that it was not mere trick of practice but the result of principle in history painting his abilities were very respectable and his invention and judgment were sufficient to have enabled him to have made à very distinguished figure in that very arduous branch of his profession if the exclusive taste of his country for portraits had not discouraged him from cultivating à talent so very unproductive and neglected his drawing though incor- rect had always something of grandeur in it his own pictures might well be applied what he used to say respecting those of rubens ee they resemble said he et well-chosen nosegay in which though the coloure are splendid and vivid they are never glaring or oppressive to the eye sir joshua was great experiment- alist with respect to the composition of his colours at first he used preparations from vegetables which he relin- quissied for minerals he is known to have purchased pictures by titian or his scholars and to have scraped off the several layers of colouring in order to ascertain it and discover his secret the englisn school of painting must acknowledge sir joshiua reynolds as its great founder under royal auspices in the establishment of the academy the pure precepts which he laid down in his annual orations were exempli¬ fied in his own works his most favourite paintings are garrick between tragedy and comedy the ugolino in prison in which he has imitated michael angelo in his te terribil via as it is called by augustino caracei in his fonnet on painting it is sir joshua ’ triumph in the art the nativity the infant hercules the death of cardinal beaufort in which are united the local colouring of titian with the chiaro feuro of rembrandt mrs. siddons mrs. billington robin goodfellow cimon and iphigene holy family which displays norel and beautiful manner of treating that very frequent sulject to speak generally of the englisn school their colouring is less glaring than that of the flemisn or venetian masters their talents are more admirable in portrait than history particularly in those of females examine says french writer picture of french woman painted by an artist of that nation and you will generally find in place of ex- pression foreed grin in which the eyes and forehead do not partake and which indicates no affection of the soul ex- amine the picture of an english woman done by one of their painters and you observe an elegant and simple expression which makes you at once acquainted with the person re- presented perhaps it might be difficult to assign to the english school as exhibited in the royal academy any perfect discrimination as each painter either implicitly follows his own genius or attaches himself to that particular manner of the foreign schools which approaches nearest to his own ideas of excellence but there are other exhibitions in which the best painters of the age have exerted fuccess- ful competition alderman boydell ’ shakespeare gallery macklin ’ gallery of subjects taken from the english poets boyer ’ gallery of those illustrative of englisn history and fuseli ’ from milton all by his own pencil are very honourable testimonies of the spirit of private individuals in the cause of the arts mr. fuseli ’ boundless imagination has attempted with surprising effect to embody several metaphysical ideas which occur in the paradise lost he has gained free and uncontrouled admission into the richest regions of fancy but appears not to be solicitous about how sew of his spectators can partially follow him there or how many are totally excluded the excellence of the present president of the royal academy mr. west in historical and scrip- tural subjects is universally allowed the institution of the order of the garter is his grand work both for com¬ position correctness and finishing his death of the stag the battles of la hogue and the boyne and his death of general wolse are all in an excellent style of composition the latter is esteemed by an eminent critic perfect model of historical composition as the pictures by barry late professor of painting in the royal academy in the rooms of the society for the encouragement of the arts are of the poetic style in the course of the last twenty years some of the most able artists this country ever produced have flourished and died the great landskape painters of italy have scarcely exceeded the smiths of chichester gainsborough and wilson in truth and nature and the accuracy of their native scenery it would be injustice not to mention wilson ’ pictures of niobe phaeton and cicero at his villa which last rivals even claude himself mortimer who died prematurely in the freedom of his pencil and the savage air of his banditti his favourite subject approached nearly to the boldest efforts of salvator rosa we rarely have met with an artist who was not admirer of some particular school or attached to some favourite manner the difficulties they find in the practice of their art tie them down to the mechanic whilst self-love and va- nity lead them into an admiratien of those strokes of the pencil which come nearest to their own of living artists we decline speaking with the exception of those whose eminence as men of genius has placed them beyond competition in the works of northcote opie and lawrencer we hail the continuance of an englisn school and the happy application of those classical precepts which its founder sir joshiua reynolds delivered with so much dignity and effect the principles of the art are exemplified in their works and genius so directed will reach degree of perfection of which the modern schools painting in europe will aspire to with unsuccessful emu¬ lation lawrence ’ colossal figure of satan and beelzebub from milton now the duke of norsolk ’ mr. kemble in coriolanus sir richard worsley ’ and as rolla in pizarro have gained him unanimous admiration design in painting good taste and correctness of design are so necessary that painter who wants them must not hope to attract esteem design being the foundation of all the other parts its elegance and correctness are no less neces- sary in painting than purity of language is in eloquence we are told by pliny that all the statues before the time of daedalus were represented stiff and motionless with the feet closed and arms hanging in right lines to their sides or they had only the head finished the body arms and legs not being expressed these were the rude essays of design in the progrefs of the art and in abler hands motion was fashiioned into grace and life was heightened into character beauty of form was no longer confined to mere imitation which always falls short of the object imitated to make the copy equal in its effect it was necessary to give it an advantage over its model the artists therefore observing that nature was sparing of her perfections and that her efforts were limited to parts availed themselves of her inequalities and drawing those scattered beauties inte more happy and compleat union rose from an im¬ perfect imitation to perfect ideal beauty we are in- formed that the painters of greece pressed in crowds to design the bosom and breast of thais nor were the elegant proportions of phryne less the object of their study by this constant contemplation of the beautisul they enriched their imagination and confirmed their taste from this fund they drew their systems of beauty and though we should consider them but as imitators of the parts we must allow them to have been the inventors in the compositions should we doubt the justice of the preference given to invented beauty over the real we need only contemplate the fine proportions and the style of drawing in the laocoon and gladiator and mark the expressive energy of apollo and the elegant beauties of the venus de medicis these are the utmost efforts of design it can reach no farther than full exertion of grace beauty and character the design of the ancients is distinguishied by an union of proportions fimplicity of contour and excellence of character there is no one excellence of design from which we derive such immediate pleasure as from gracefulness of action if we observe the attitudes and movements of the greek statues we shall mark that careless decency and unassected grace which ever attend the motions of men unconscious of observation raphael has been wonderfully happy in imitating this simple elegance of the antique the most courtly imagin- ation can not represent to itself an image of more winning grace than is to be seen in his sancta cæcilia indeed an elegant simplicity is the characteristie of his design we no where meet in him the affected contrasts of michael angelo or the studied attitudes of guido the design of raphael was in its beginning dry but correct he enlarged it much on seeing the drawings of michael angelo of too just an eye to give intirely into the excesses of his model he struck out middle style which however was not so happily blended as quite to throw off the inssuence of the extremes hence in the great he is apt to swell into the charged in the delicate to drop into the little his design notwithstanding is beautisul but never arrived to that persection which we discover in the greek statues he is excellent in the characters of philosopliers apostles and the like but the figures of his women have not that elegance which is distinguisned in the venus di medicis of the daughter of niobe in these his convex contours have à certain heaviness by which in seeking to avoid he falls into dryness still less pardonable his proportions are esteemed excellent yet not having formed his manner on the most beautiful antique we do not see in him that elegant symmetry that freedom in the joints which lend all their motion to the laocoon and gladiatorl instead of these the figures of michael angelo were his models in the great style whence having quitted the lines of nature and not having substituted ideal beauty he became too like his original as may be seen in his incendio di borgo would we therefore place raphael in his true point of view we must observe him in the middle age in old men or in the nervous nature in his madonna ’ he knew how to choose as likewise how to vary the most beautiful parts of nature but he knew not how to express beauty superior to the natural thus in his galatea where he has attempted cha- racter of perfect beauty he has fallen short of the beauty of his madonna ’ the cause of this seems to be that he drew the former after his own ideas which were im perfect in the latter he copied beautiful nature which was almost perfect à second observation will confirm this opinion of all the objects of painting angels call moft for ideal beauty and those of raphael are by no meant distinguished in this particular one of the greatest excellences of design is grace cor- regio in this is inimitable his constant aim was grace and happy effect of light and shade waving and varied contour was necessary to this end hence he studi oussy avoided right lines and acute angles as too simple in their effects thus the habit and necessity of continually varying his outline threw him into little errors in draw- ing which spring not from an ignorance of this branch of his art but from predilection for another and there are few who would wishi those inadvertences away accom- panied with the charms which gave occasion to them we may affirm of hiis design where it is not sacrificed to his more favorite aims that it is often masterly and always pleasing quality rarely to be met with in those servile painters who think they have attained every persection if they keep within the rules of drawing such painters says quintilian while they think it sufficient to be free from faults fall into that capital fault the want of beauties we shall close this article with an account of the apollo belvidere and the celebrated groupe of laocoon so long the pride of rome but removed to paris during its ravages by the french republicans as described by the late abbe winckleman the apollo belvidere et of all the productions of art which have escaped the ravages of time the statue of apollo belvedere is unques- tionably the most sublime the artist founded this work upon imagination and has only employed substance for the purpose of realizing his ideas as much as the descriptions which homer has given of apollo are superior to those given of him by other poets in the same degree is this statue superior to any other statues of that deity its stature is above that of man and its attitude breathes majesty an eternal spring such as reigns in the delightful fields of elysium clothes with youth the manly charms of his body and gives brilliancy to the animated structure of his limbs endeavour to penetrate into the regions of incorporeal beauty try to become the creator of celestial nature in order to elevate your soul to the contemplation of super- natural beauties for here there is nothing mortal neither thie veins nor sinews are too conspicuous kind of celestiai spirit animates the whole figure the god has pursued python against whom he has for the first time bent his dreadful bow in his rapid course he has overtaken him and given him mortal blow in the height of his joy his august features denote more than victory disdain is seated on his lips and the indignation which he breathes distends his nostrils and affects his eye-brows but still his forehead expresses serenity and he is all full of sweet- ness as if he were surrounded by the muses eager to caress him among all the figures of jupiter which we possess you will not see one in which the father of the gods displays so much of that majesty described by the poets as does this statue of his son the peculiar beauties of all the other gods are united in this figure in the same manner as in the divine pandora the forehead is the forehead of jupiter impregnated with the goddess of wisdom his eye-brows by their movement declare their wishies his eyes in their celestial orbits are the eyes of the queen of the goddesses and the mouth is that which inspired the beautiful bacchus with voluptuousness like the tender branches of the vine his sine hairs play about as if they were slightly ruffled by the breath of zephyrs they seemed erfumed with celestial essence and negligently tied by the hands of the graces on seeing this prodogy of art forgot the whole uni¬ verse placed myself in more noble attitude to contem plate it with dignity from admiration passed to extacy silled with respect felt my breast agitated like those who are inspired with the spirit of prophecy et felt myself transported to delas and the sacred woods of lycia places which apollo honoured with his presence for the beauty which was before my eyes appeared to be animated as was formerly the beautiful statue produced by the chizel of pygmalion how can describe you oh inimitable chef ’ auvrel art itself must inspire me and guide my pen ee the outlines which have traced lay at your seet so those who can not reach to the head of the deity they adore place at his feet the garlands with which they wishi to crown him the groupe of laocoon ee laocoon prefents to us picture of the deepest distrefs under the representation of man contending with all his powers in his own defence while his muscles and sinews are dilated and contracted by agony vou may still perceive the vigour of his mind expressed on his wrinkled forehead his breast oppressed with restrained respiration seems to contend against the pain with which it is agitated ee the groans which he restrains and his breath which he holds in seei to exhaust the lower part of his body and the loins by being drawn in seem to discover his very entrails nevertheless his own sufferings seem to affect him less than those of his children who look up to him as if imploring his succour compassion like dark vapour overshadows his eyes his physiognomy denotes complaint his eyes are directed towards heaven imploring assistance his mouth bespeaks languor and his lower lip is fallen agony mixed with indignation at his unjust punishment is displayed in all his features the contest between pain and resistance is displayed with the greatest sxill for while the former draws up the eye-brows the latter compresses the flesn over the eyes and makes it descend over the upper eye-lids the subject not allowing the artist to embellisn nature he has exerted himself to display contention and vigour in those places where there is the greatest agony there is also great beauty the left side on which the furious serpent makes its attack seems to be in the greatest pain from its proximity to the heart this part of the body may be called prodigy of art laocoon wishies to raise his legs in order to escape no part of the figure is in repose the very flesn by the skill of the artist has the appearance of being benumbed of colouring colouring though subject greatly inferior to many others which the painter must study is yet of sufficient importance to employ considerable share of his attention and to excel in it he must be well acquainted with that part of optics which has the nature of light and colours for its object light however simple and uncompounded it may appéar is nevertheless made up as it were of several distinct substances and the number and even dose of these ingredients has been happily discovered by the moderns every undivided ray let it be ever so fine is little bundle of red orange yellow green azure indigo and violet rays which while combined are not to be distinguished one from another and form that kind of light called white so that white is not colour perse as the learned de vinci so far it feems the precursor of newton expressly affirms but an assemblage of colours now these colours which compose light although immu¬ table in themselves and endued with various qualities are continually however separating from each other in their reflection from and passage through other substances and thus become manifest to the eye grafs for example reflects only green rays or rather reflects green rays in greater number than it does those of any other colour one kind of wine transmits red rays and another yellowish rays and from this kind of separation arises that variety of colours with which nature has diversified her various pro- ductions.. man too has contrived to separate the rays of light by making portion of the sun ’ beams pafs through glass prism for after passing through it they appear divided into seven pure and primitive colours placed in succession one by the other like so many colours on painter ’ pallet now though titian corregio and vandyke have been excellent colourists without knowing any thing of tliese phyfical subtleties that is no reason why others should neglect them for it can not but be of great service to painter to be well acquainted with the nature of what he is to imitate and of those colours with which he is to give life and perfection to his designs not to speak of the plea¬ sure there is in being able to account truly and solidly for the various effects and appearances of light from due tempering for example and graduating of the tints in picture from making colours partake of each other ac- cording to the reflection of light from one object to ano¬ ther there arises in some measure that sublime harmony which may be considered as the true music of the eye and this harmony has its foundation in the genuine prin- ciples of opties now this could not happen in the system os those philosophers who held that colours did not ori- ginally exist in light but were on the contrary nothing else than so many modifications which it underwent in being reflected from other substances or in passing through them thus subject to alterations without end and every moment liable to perish were that the case bodies could no more receive any hues one from another nor this body partake of the colour of that than scarlet for example because it has the power of changing into red all the rays of the sun or sky which immediately sall upon it has the power of changing into red all the other rays reflected to it from blue or any other colour in its neighbourhood whereas allowing that colours are in their own nature imiutable one into another and that every body reflects more or less every sort of coloured rays though those rays in the greatest number which are of the colour it exhibits there must necessarily arise in colours placed near one another certain particular hues or temperaments of colour nay this influence of one colour upon another may be so far traced that three or you bodies of different colours and likewise the intenseness of the light falling upon each being assigned we may easily determine in what situations and how much they would tinge each other we may thus too by the same principle of optics account for several other things practised by painters inso- much that person who has carefully observed natural effects with an eye directed by solid learning shall be able to form general rules where another can only distinguish particular cases but after all the pictures of the best colourists are it is universally allowed the books in which young painter must chiefly look for the rules of colouring that is of that branch of painting which contributes so much to express the beauty of objects and is so requisite to represent them as what they really are giorgio and titian seem to have discovered circumstances in nature which others have entirely overlooked and the last in particular has been happy enough to express them with pencil as delicate as his eye was quick and piercing in his works we behold that sweetnefs of colouring which is produced by union that beauty which is consistent with truth and all the in- sensible transmutations all the soft transitions in word all the pleasing modulations of tints and colours when young painter has by close application acquired from titian whom he can never sufficiently dwell upon that art which of all painters he has best contrived to hide he would do well to turn to bassano and paolo on account of the beauty boldnefs and elegance of their touches that richnefs softness and freshness of colouring for which the lombard school is so justly cried up may like- wise be of great service to him nor will he reap less benefit by studying the principles and practice of the fle- missi school which chiesly by means of her varnishes has contrived to give most enchanting lustre and transparency to her colours but whatever pictures young painter may choose to study the art of colouring upon he must take great care that they are well preserved there are very sew pieces which have not suffered more or less by the length not to say the injuries of time and perhaps that precious patina which years alone can impart to paintings is in some mea- fure akin to that other kind which ages alone impart to medals inasmuch as by giving testimony to their anti¬ quity it renders them proportionably beautisul in the super- stitious eyes of the learned it must indeed be allowed that if on the one band this patina bestows as it really does an extraordinary degree of harmony upon the colours of picture and destroys or at least greatly lessens their original rawness it on the other hand equally impairs the freshiness and lise of them piece seen many years aster it has been painted appears much as it would do imme¬ diately after painting behind dull glass it is no idle opinion that paolo veronese attentive above all things to the beauty of his colours and what is called strepiro left entirely to time the care of harmonizing them perfectly and as we may say mellowing them but most of the old masters took that task upon themselves and never exposed their works to the eyes of the public until they had ripened and finished them with their own hands and who can say whether the christ of moneta or the nativity of bassano have been more improved or injured if we may so speak by the touchings and re-touchings of time in the course of more than two centuries it is indeed impossible to be determined but the studious pupil may make himself ample amends for any injuries which his originals may have received from the hands of time by turning to truth and to nature which never grows old but constantly retains its primitive slower of youth and was itself the model of the models before him as soon therefore as young painter has laid proper foundation for good colouring by study- ing the best masters he should turn all his thoughts to truth and nature and it would perhaps be well worth while to have in the academies of painting models for colouring as well as designing that as from the one the pupils learn to give their due proportion to the several members and mus¬ cles they may learn from the other to make their carnations rich and warm and faithfully copy the different local hues which appear quite distinct in the different parts of fine bodv to illustrate still farther the use of such model let us suppose it placed in different lights now in that of the sun now in that of the sky and now again in that of lamp or candle one time placed in the shade and another in reflected light hence the pupil may learn all the disserent efsects of the complection in different circumstances whe- ther the livid the lucid or transparent and above all that variety of tints and half tints occasioned in the colour of the skin by the epidermis having the bones immediately under it in some places and in others greater or less number of blood-vessels or quantity of fat an artist who had long studied such model would run no risk of de¬ grading the beauties of nature by any particularity of stile or of giving into that preposterous fulness and floridness of colour which is at present so much the taste he would not feed his figures with roses as an ancient painter of greece shrewdly expressed it but with good beef differ- ence which the learned eye of modern writer could per- ceive between the colouring of barocci and that of titian to practise in that manner is according to great master no better than inuring one ’ self to the commission of blunders what statues are in design nature is in colour ing the fountain head of that perfection to which every artist ambitious to excel should constantly aspire an accordingly the flemish painters in consequence of their aiming solely to copy nature are in colouring as excellent as they are wont to be aukward in designing the best model for the tone of colours and the degradation of shades is furnishied by means of the cumera-obscura we may form general idea of the various effects of reflections from the following examples if blue be reflected on yellow the latter becomes greenish if on red the red becomes purple and so on through variety of combi- nations and as the white is of nature to receive all the colours and to be tinged with that of each reflection the painter must he caresul how his carnations may be affected by the several reflections of composition composition which may be considered as branch of invention consists in the proper stationing of what the inventive faculty has imagined so as to exprefs the subject in the most lively manner the chief merit of compo¬ sition may be said to consist in that disorder which wear- ing the appearance of mere chance is in fact the most studied effect of art painter therefore is equally to avoid the drynefs of those ancients who always planted their figures like so many couples in procefsion and the affectation of those moderns who jumble them together as if they were met merely to fight and squabble in this branch raphael was happy enough to choose the just medium and attain perfection the disposition of his figures is always exactly such as the subject requires in the battle of con- stantine they are confusedly clustered with as much art as they are regularly marshalled in christ ’ commitment of the keys to st. peter and constituting him prince of the apostles let the inferior figures of piece be placed as they will the principal figure should strike the eye most and stand out as it were from among the rest this may be effected various ways as by placing it on the foremost lines or in some other-conspicuous part of the piece by exhibiting it in manner by itself by making the principal light fall upon it by giving it the most resplendent drapery or in- deed by several of these methods nay by all of them toge¬ ther for beins the hero of the picturesque fable it is hut just thatit should draw the eye to itself and lord it as it were over al the other objects according to leon batista alberti painters should follow the example of comic writers who compose their fable of as few persons as possible for in fact crowded picture is apt to give as much pain to the spectator as crowded road to the traveller some subjects it must be granted require à number nay nation as it were of figures on these occasions it depends entirely on the skill of the painter to dispose of them in such manner that the principal ones may always make the principal appearance and contrive mat- ters so that the piece be not over-crowded or want conve- nient rests and pauses he must in word take care that his piece be full but not charged in this respect the battles of alexander by le brun are master-pieces which can never be sufficiently studied whereas nothing on the other hand can be more unhappy than the famous paradise of tintoret which covers one entire side of the great council¬ chamber at venice it appears no bêtter than confused heap of figures swarm cloud chaos which pains and fatigues the eye what pity it is that he did not dispose this subject aster à model of his own now in the gallery of bevilacqua at verona in this last the several choirs of martyrs virgins bishops and other saints are judicioussy thrown into so many clusters parted here and there by à fine sleece of clouds so as to exhibit the innu¬ merable host of heaven drawn up in way that makes most agreeable and glorious appearance there goes story to our purpose of celebrated master who in drawing of the universal deluge the better to express the immensity of the waters that covered the earth left corner of his paper without figures being afked if he did not intend to sill it up no said he do not you see that my leaving it empty is what precisely constitutes the picture the reason for breaking composition into several groups is that the eye passing freely from one object to another may the better comprehend the whole but the painter is not to stop here for these groups are besides to be so artsully put together as to form rich clusters give the whole composition singular air of grandeur and afford the spectator an opportunity of discerning the piece at distance and taking the whole in as it were at single glance these effects are greatly promoted by due regard to the nature of colours so as not to place together those which are apt to pain by their opposition or distract by their variety they should be so judicioussy disposed as to temper and qualify each other proper use of the chiaro-scuro is likewise of great ser- vice on this occasion the groups are easily parted and the whole picture acquires grand effect by introducing some strong falls of snade and above all one principal beam of light this method has been followed with great success by rembrandt in famous picture of his represent- ing the virgin at the foot of the crofs on mount calvary the principal light darting upon her through break of the clouds while the rest of the figures about her stand more or less in the shade tintoret too acquired great repu¬ tation as well by that brifkness with which he enlivened bis figures as by his masterly manner of shading them and polidoro de caravaggio though he scarce painted any thing but basso-relievos was particularly famous for intro- ducing with great skill the effects of the chiaro-scuro thing first attempted by mantegna in his triumph of julius cæsar it is by this means that his compositions appear so strikingly divided into different groups and among their other perfections afford so much delight through the beau- tiful disposition that reigns in them in like manner painter by the help of perspective especially that called ærial the opposition of local colours and other contrivances which he may expect to hit upon by studying nature and those who have best studied her before him will be able not only to part his groups hut make them appear at disserent distances so as to leave sufficient passages between them but the greatest caution is to be used in the purfuit of the methods here laid down especially in the management of the chiaro-scuro that the effects attributed to light and shade and to their various concomitants may not run counter to truth and experience this is capital point for this purpose painter would do well to make in little figures as tintoret and poussin used to do model of the subject that he intends to represent and then illuminate it by lamp er candle-light by this means he may come to know with certainty if the chiaro-scuro which he has formed in his mind does not clasti with the reason of things by varying the height and direction of his light he may easily discover such accidental effects as are most likely to recommend his performance and so establisn proper system for the illuminating it nor will he after- wards find it difficult matter to modisy the quality of his shades by softening or strengthening them according to the situation of his scene and the quality of the light falling upon it ifit should happen to be candle or lamp¬ light scene he would then have nothing to do but consider his model well and faithfully copy it in the next place to turn groupe elegantly the best pattern is that of bunch of grapes adopted by titian as of the many grains that compose bunch of grapes someare struck directly by the light and those opposite to them are in the shade whilst the intermediate ones partake of botli ight and shade in greater or less degree so according to titian the figures of groupe should be so disposed that by the union of the chiaro-scuro several things may appear as it were but one thing and in fact it is only from his having pursued this method that we can account for the very grand effect of his pieces this way in which it is impossible to study him too much the mannerists who do not follow nature in the track of the masters just mentioned are apt to commit many faults the reason of their figures casting their snades in this or that manner seldom appears in the picture or at least does not appear sufficiently probable they are besides wont to trespass all bounds in splafhiing their pieces with light that is enlivening those parts which we usually term the deafs of picture this method no doubt has sometimes very sine effect but it is however to be used with no small discretion as otherwise the whole loses that union that pause that majestic silence as caracci used to call it which affords so much pleasure the eye is not less hurt by many lights scattered here and there over picture than the ear is by the confused noise of different persons speaking all together in an asfembly guido reni who has imparted to his paintings that gaiety and splendour in which he lived seems enamoured with bright and open light whereas michael angelo de caravagio who was of sullen and savage disposition appears sondest of gloomy and clouded sky so that neither of them were qualified to handle indifferently all objects the chiaro-scuro may likewise prove of great service to painter in giving his composition grand effect but never- thelefs the light he chooses must be adapted to the situation of the scene where the action is laid nor would he be less faulty who in grottoor cavern where the light entered by chink snould make his shades soft and tender than he wlio should represent them strong and bold in an open sky-light but this is by no means the only fault which mannerists are apt to be guilty of in historical pieces and particularly in the disposition of their figures to say nothing of their favourite groupe of woman lying on the ground with one child at her breast and another playing about her and the like which they generally place on the first lines of their pieces nor of those half-figures in the back ground peep¬ ing out from the hollows contrived for them they make à common practice of mixing naked with clothed figures old men with young placing one figure with its face towards you and another with its back they contrast violent motions with languid attitudes and seem to aim at opposition in every thing whereas oppositions never please but when they arise naturally from the sulject like anti¬ theses in discourse as to foreshortened sigures too mucl assectation in using or avoiding them is equally blamable the attitudes had better be composed than otherwise it very seldom happens that there is any occasion for making them so impetuous as to be in danger of losing their equilibrium thing too much practised by some painters in regard to drapery equal care should be taken to avoid that poverty which makes some masters look as if through mere penury they grudged clothes to their figures and that profusion which albani imputed to guido saying that he was rather à tailor than painter the ornaments of dress should be used with great sobriety and it will not be amiss to remember what was once said to an ancient painter pity you greatly unable to make helen handsome you liave taken care to make her sine let the whole in word and all the different parts of the composition possess probability grace costume and the particular character of what is to be represented let nothing look like unisormity of manner which does not appear less in the composition than it does in colouring drapery and design and is as it were that kind of accent by which painters may be as readily distinguished as foreigners are by pronouneing in the same manner all the different languages they happen to be acquainted with crayon painting whether the painter works with oil colours water colours or crayons the grand olject of his purfuit is still the same à just imitation of nature but each species has its peculiar rules and methods painting with crayons re- quires in many respects treatment different from painting in oil colours because all colours used dry are in their nature of much warmer complexion than when wet with oils or any other binding fluid let this be proved by matter of fact -mr. cotes painted portrait of sir william chambers which is in lord besborough ’ collection an ingenious foreigner had discovered method of fixing crayon pictures so that iliey would not rub or receive an injury if auy accident happened to the glass the society for the encouragement of arts had before offered premium to any one who should discover so valuable secret for which premium he made application mr. cotes being eminent in his prosession was desired to lend picture for the trial and give his judgment which was made on this portrait of sir william chambers tlie crayons he indeed so persect- ly fixed as so resist any ruh or brush without the leust injury which before would have entirely defaced or spoiled it but the picture which before had particularly warm brilliant and agreeable effect in comparison became cold and purple and though in one sense the attempt succeeded to the de- signed intention of sixing the colours yet the binding quali¬ ty of whatever sluid was made use of in the process chang- ed the complexion of the colours rendering the cold teints too predominant for this reason in order to produce rich picture much greater portion of what painters term cooling tints must be applied in crayon painting than would be judicious to use in oils without any danger of mistake it is to be supposed the not being acquainted with this observation is one great cause why so many oil painters have no better success when they attempt crayon painting on the contrary crayon painters being so much used to those tints which are of cold nature when used wet are apt to introduce them too much when they paint with oils which is seldom productive of good effect another observation would make which requires par- ticular notice from the student who has been conversant with oil painting prior to his attempts with crayons oil painters begin their pictures much lighter and fainter than they intend to finish them which presents the future co¬ louring clear and brilliant the light underneath greatly assisting the transparent glazing and scumbling colours which if they were laid over any part already too dark would but increase its heavy effect on the contrary cray- ons being made of dry colours are difficult to procure fuffi- ciently dark the crayon painter therefore will find an ab- solute necessity to begin his picture in dark and rich as pos¬ sible except in the strongest lights for if once the grey and light tints become predominant it will be next to im¬ ossible for him in the deep shadows especially to restore depth and brilliancy having no opportunity of glazing or scumbling to give the effect as the grey tints being mix- tures with whiting underneath will continually work up and render the attempt abortive shall now endeavour to give the student some directions towards the attainment of excellence in this art the student must provide himself with some strong blue paper the thicker the better if the grain is not too coarse and knotty though it is almost impossible to get any intire- free from knots the knots should be levelled with penknise or razor otherwise they will prove exceedingly troublesome after this is done the paper must be pasted very smooth on linen cloth previoussy strained on deal frame the size according to the artist ’ pleafure on this the picture is to be executed but it is most eligible not to paste the paper on till the whole subject is first dead-co¬ loured the method of doing this is very easy by laying the paper with the dead-colour on its face upon fmooth board or table when by means of brush the backside of the paper must be covered with paste the frame with the strained cloth must then be laid on the pasted side of the paper after which turn the painted side uppermost and lay piece of clean paper upon it to prevent fmearing this being done it may be stroked gently over with the hand by which means all the air between the cloth and the paper will be forced out when the paste is persectly dry the student may proceed with the painting the advantages arising from pasting the paper in the frame according to this method after that side of the paper should be pasted which has the strokes from the wires most evident that the painting may be on the smoothest side otherwise the lines which these wires have left in the paper will prove troublesome and look unpleasant some crayon pictures are painted on vellum but the animal salts in the skin very often cause them to mildew it must be confessed the vellum gives tne picture à foft effect but its use can not be recommended in our unsavour- able climate others make use of smalt grounds le tour lately painter the picture is begun are very great as the crayons will adhere much better than any other way which will enable the student to finish the picture with firmer body of co¬ lour and greater lustre the late mr. cotes discovered this method by accident and esteemed it valuable acquisi¬ tion and remember on particular occasion he re- moved sine crayon picture of rozalba ’ and placed it on another strained cloth without the least injury by soak ing the canvas with wet sponge till the pafte between the cloth and paper was sufficiently wet to admit of separation when painters want to make very correct copy of picture they generally make use of tiffany or black gauze strained tight on frame which they lay flat on the subject to be imitated and with piece of sketching chalk trace all the outlines on the tiffany they then lay the canvas to be painted on flat upon the sloor placing the tiffany with the chalked lines upon it and with an hand¬ kerchief brush the whole over this prefents the exact out¬ lines of the pictureon the canvas the crayon painter may also make use of this method when the subject of his imi¬ tation is in oils but in copying crayon picture he must have recourse to the following method on account of the glass the picture being placed upon the esel let the outlines be drawn on the glass with small camel ’ hair peneil dip¬ ped in lake ground thin with oils which must be done with great exactness after this is accomplishied take à sheet of paper of the same size and place it on the glass stroking of note in paris often used them with great fuccess the method to prepare them is to brush over the paper with gum water which directmy strew with smalt moderately fine the superfluous part of which should be swept off with painter ’ brussi when the gum water is perfectly dry on this the picture is to be painted but we have paper now in england to be procured of so ex- cellent texture as to render this preparation perhaps unnecessary over all the lines with the hand by which means the co¬ lours will adhere to the paper which must be pierced with pin holes pretty close to each other the paper intended to be used for the painting must next be laid upon table and the pierced paper placed upon it then with some fine pounded charcoal tied up in piece of lawn rub over the perforated strokes which will give an exact outline great care must be taken not to brushi this off till the whole is drawn over with sketching chalk which is composition made of whiting and tobaccopipe clay rolled like crayons and pointed at each end when the student paints immediately from the life it will be most prudent to make correct drawing of the out- lines on another paper the size of the picture he is going to paint which he may trace by the preceding method be¬ cause erroneous strokes of the sketching chalk which are not to be avoided without great expertness will prevent the crayons from adhering to the paper owing to certain greasy quality in the composition the student will find the sitting posture with the box of crayons on his lap the most convenient method for him to paint the part of the picture he is immediately painting should be rather below his face for if it is placed too high the arm will be fatigued let the windows of the room where he paints he darkened at least to the height of six feet from the ground and the subject to be painted should be situated in such manner that the light may fall with every advantage on the face avoiding too much shadow which seldom has good effect in portrait painting especi- ally if the face he paints has any degree of delicacy before he begins to paint let him be attentive to his subject and appropriate the action or attitude proper to the age of the subject if child let it be childishi if young lady ex- press more vivacity than in the majestie beauty of middle aged woman who also should not be expressed with the same gravity as person far advanced in years let the embel¬ lishments of the picture and introduction of birds animals be regulated by the rules of propriety and consistency the features of the face being carefully drawn with chalk let the student take crayon of pure carmine and carefully draw the nostril and edge of the nose next the shadow then with the faintest carmine tint lay in the strongest light upon the nose and forehead which must be executed broad he is then to proceed gradually with the second tint and the suc- ceeding ones till he arrives at the shadows which must be covered brilliant enriched with much lake carmine little broken with brilliant green this method will at first offensively strike the eye from its crude appearance but in finishing it will be good foundation to produce plea- sing effect colours being much more easily sullied when too bright than when the first colouring is dull to raise the picture into brilliant state the several pearly tints discernable in sine complexions must be imitated with blue verditer and white which answers to the ultramarine tints used in oils but if the parts of the face where these tints appear are in shadow the crayons composed of black and white must be substituted in their place though all the face when first coloured should be laid in as brilliant as possible yet each part should be kept in its proper tone by which means the rotundity of the face will be preserved let the student be caresul when he begins the eyes to draw them with crayon inelined to the carmine tint of whatever colour the iris are of he must lay them in brilliant and at first not loaded with colour but executed lightly no notice is to be taken of the pupil yet the stu- dent must let the light of the eye incline very much to the blue cast cautioussy avoiding à staring white appear- ance which when once introduced is seldom overcome preserving broad shadow thrown on its upper part by the eye-lashi black and heavy tint is also to be avoid- ed in the eye-brows it is therefore best to execute them like broad glowing shadow at first on which in the finishing the hairs of the brow are to be painted by which method of proceeding the former tints will shew themselves through and produce the most pleasing effect the student should begin the lips with pure carmine and lake and in the shadow use some carmine and black the strong vermillion tints should be laid on afterwards he must beware of executing them with stiff harsh lines gently intermixing each with the neigbouring colours making the shadow beneath broad and enriched with brilliant crayons he must form the corner of the mouth with carmine brown oker and greens varioussy intermixed if the hair is dark he should preserve much of the lake and deep carmine tints therein this may be easily overpowered by the warmer hair tints which as observed in painting the eye-brows will produce richer effect when the picture it finished on the contrary if this method is unknown or neglected poverty of colouring will be discernable after the student has covered over or as artists term it has dead-coloured the head he is to sweeten the whole to- gether by rubbing it over with his finger beginning at the strongest light upon the forehead passing his singervery light- ly and uniting it with the next tint which he must continue till the whole is sweetened together often wiping his finger on towel to prevent the colours being sullied he must be cautious not to smooth or sweeten his picture too often because it will give rise to thin and scanty effect and have more the appearance of drawing than solid painting as nothing but body of rich colours can constitute à rich effect to avoid this as the student finds it necessary to sweeten with the singer he must continually replenisn the picture with more crayon when the head is brought to some degree of forwardnefs let the back ground be laid in which must be treated in different covering it as thin as possible and rubbing it into the paper with leather stump near the face the paper should be almost free from colour for this will do great service to the head and by its thinnefs give both soft and solid appearance in the back ground also crayons which have whiting in their composition should be used but seldom or never without caution but chiessy such as are the most brilliant and the least adulterated the ground being painted thin next the hair will give the student an opportunity of painting the edges of the hair over in light and free manner when he gives the finishing touches the student having proceeded thus far the face hair and back ground being entirely covered he must carefully view the whole at some distance remarking in what respect it is out of keeping that is what parts are too light and what too dark being particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearances which must be subdued with lake and carmine the above method being properly put into execution will produce the appearance of painting prin¬ cipally composed of three colours viz carmine black and white which is the best preparation painter can make for producing sine crayon picture the next step is to compleat the back ground and the hair as the dust in painting these will sall on the face and would much injure it if that was compleated first from thence proceed to the forehead finishing downward till the whole picture is compleated back grounds may be of various colours but it requires great taste and judgment to fuit them properly to different complexions in general strong coloured head should have weak and tender tinted ground and on the contrary à delicate complexion should be opposed with strong and powersul tints by which proper contrast between the sigure and the back ground the picture will receive great force and strike the spectator much more than it could possibly do was this circumstance of contrast not attend¬ ed to young painters often treat the back grounds of pictures as à matter of very little or no consequence when it is most certain great part of the beauty and brilliancy of the picture especially the face depends upon the tints being well suited the darks kept in their proper places and the whole being perfectly in subordination to the face thus à simple back ground requires attention but the difficulty is still greater when variety of objects are introduced such as hills trees buildings in these cases one rule must be strictly attended to that each grand object be disposed so as to contrast each other this is not meant merely respecting their forms but their colour their light shade for instance we will suppose the figure receiving the strongest light behind the figure and very near at hand are the stems of some large trees these must have shade thrown over them either from driving cloud or some other inter- posing circumstance behind these stems of trees and at distance are seen trees on à rising ground these should re- ceive the light as contrast to the former lf an ar- chitectural back ground be chosen the same rule must be applied suppose building at moderate distance is placed behind the figure receiving the light column or some other object in shadow should intervene to preserve proper decorum in the piece or what will have the same effect shadow must be thrown over the lower part of the building which will give equal fatisfaction or repose to the eye it must be remembered the light must be always placed against the dark and the weak against the strong in order to pro- duce force and essect and vice versa in painting over the forehead the last time begin the highest light with the most faint vermillion tint in the same place where the faint carmine was first laid keeping it broad in the same manner in the next shade succeeding the lightest the student must work in some light blue tints composed of verditer and white intermixing with them some of the deeper vermillion tints sweetening them to- gether with great caution insensibly melting them into one another increasing the proportion of each colour as his ugdment shall direct some brilliant yellows may also be used but sparingly and towards the roots of the hair strong verditer tints intermixed with greens will be of singular service cooling crayons composed of black and white should succeed these and melt into the hair be¬ neath the eyes the pleasing pearly tints are to be preserved composed of verditer and white and under the nose and on the temples the same may be used beneath the lips tints of this kind also are proper mixing them with the light greens and some vermillion the introduction of greens and blues into the face in painting has often given surprize to those who are unac- quainted with the art but there is reason sufficient for their introduction though it may appear strange at first in order to break and correct the other colours the carmine predominating in the dead colour is as has been observed the best preparation for the succeeding tints the crudeness of this preparation must be corrected hy varioussy intermixing greens blues and yellows which of these are to be used is to be determined by the degree this direction is sor the finest complexions but the student must vary nis colouring accordin to his subject of carmine in the dead colour and the complexion intended the blue and yellow are of nature diametrically opposite and serve to correct the reds and oppose one another the greens being compounded of both these colours is of pecu- liar use in many cases were the transition is not to be so violent the student attentively considering nature will discover pleasing variety of colours on the furface and discernible through clear and transparent skin this variety will be still increased by the effect of light and shade he will per¬ ceive one part inclining to the vermillion red another to the carmine or lake one to the blue this to the green and that to the yellow in order to produce these different effects he will apply those colours to which the tints are most inclined yet in crayon painting it is often best to compound the mixed colours upon the picture such as blue and yellow instead of green blue and carmine instead of purple red and yellow instead of orange in other circum- stances the compounds already mixed should be used but in this case there can be no absolute rule given it must be left to the experience and discretion of the painter though the student may be greatly assisted in the commencement of his studies by an able master to direct and point out the best method to treat circumstances of this nature as they occur in practice which may at first appear obscure and mysterious but will soon to good capacity become de- monstrably clear upon certain and sure principles the cir- cumstances that require different treatment are so various and so many as to render it impossible here to descend to every particular in finishing the cheeks let the pure lake clear them froin any dust contracted from the other crayons then with the lake may be intermixed the bright vermillion and last of all if the subject should requre it few touches of the orange coloured crayon but with extreme caution after this sweeten that part with the finger as little as possible for sear of producing hieavy disagreeable essect on the cheeks as the beauty of crayon picture consists in one colour shiewing itself throughi or rather between another this the student can not too often remark it being the only method of imitating beautiful complexions the eye is the most difficult fcature to execute in crayons as every part must be expressed with the utmost nicety to appear finishied at the same time that the painter must pre- serve its breadth and solidity while he is particularizing the parts to accomplishi this it will be good general rule sfor the student to use his crayon in sweetening as much and his singer as liitle as possible when he wants point to touch small part with he may break off little of his crayon against the box which will produce corner fit to work with in the minutest parts if the eye-lashies are dark he must use some of the carmine and brown oker and the crayon of carmine and black and with these he may also touch the iris of the eye if brown or hazel making broad shadow caused by the eye-lasni red tints of vermillion carmine and lake will execute the corners of the eye properly but if the eye-lids are too red they will have disagrecable sore appearance the pupil of the eye must be made of pure lamp-black between this and the lower part of the iris the light will catch very strong but it must not be made too sudden but be gently diffused round the pupil tiil it is lost in shade when the eye-balls are sufficiently prepared the shining speck must be made with pure white erayon which should be first broken to point and then laid on firm but as it is possible they may be desective in neatness they should be corrected with pin taking off the redundant parts by which means they may be formed as neat as can be required the difficulty with respect to the nose is to preserve the lines properly determined and at the same time so artfully blended into the check as to express its projection and yet no real line to be perceptible upon close examin- ation in some circumstances it should be quite blendid with the check which appears behind it and determined entirely with slight touch of red chalk the shadow caused by the nose is generally the darkest in the whole face partaking of no reflection from its furrounding parts carmine and brown oker carmine and black and such brilliant crayons will compose it best the student having before prepared the lips with the strongest lake and carmine must with these colours make them compleatly correct and when finishing intro¬ duce the strong vermillions but with great caution as they are extremely predominant this if properly touched will give the lips an appearance equal if not superior to those executed in oils notwithstanding the seeming supe¬ riority the latter has by means of glazing of which the former is entirely destitute when the student paints the neck he should avoid ex- pressing the muscles too strong in the stem nor should the bones appear too evident on the chest as both have an un¬ pleasing effect denoting violent agitation of the body circumstance seldom necessary to express in portrait painting the most necessary part to be expressed and which should ever be observed even in the most delicate subjects is strong marking just above the place where the collar bones unite and if the head is much thrown over the shoulders some notice should be taken of the large muscle that rises the method with which painters in oil express transparency in the lips is by painting them first with light vermillion tints and when dry touchint them over with pure lake from behind the ear and is inserted into the pit between the collar bones all inferior muscles should be in general quite avoided the student will sind this caution neces- sary as most subjects especially thin persons have the muscles of the neck much more evident than would be judicious to imitate as sew necks are too long it may be necessary to give some addition to the stem fault on the other side being quite unpardonable nothing being more ungraceful than short neck in colouring the neck let the student preserve the stem of pearly hue and the light not so strong as on the chest if any part of the breast appears its transparency must also be expressed by pearly tints but the upper part of the chest should be cosoured with heautiful vermillions delicately blendid with the other of the materials hhe perfection of the crayons consists in great meafure in their softnefs for it is impossible to execute brilliant picture with them if they are otherwise on which account great care should be observed in the preparing them fo pre- vent their being hard-in all compositions slake white and white lead should be wholly rejected because the slightest touch with either of these will unavoidably turn black the usual objection to crayon paintings is that they are subject to change but whenever this happens it is entirely owing to an injudicious use of the above-mentioned whites which will stand only in oils to obviate the bad effects arising from the use of such crayons let the student make use of common whiting prepared in the following manner take large vessel of water put the whiting into it and mix them well together let this stand about half minute then pour off the top into another vessel and throw the gritty sediment away let what is prepared rest about minute and then pour it off as before which will purisy the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittiness when this is done let the whiting settle and then pour the water from it after which lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for use either for white crayons or the purpose of preparing tints with other colours for with this all other tints may be safely prepared the student must be provided with large slexible pallet- knife large stone and muller to levigate the colours two or three large pieces of chalk to absorb the moisture from the colours aster they are levigated piece of flat glafs to prevent the moisture from being absorbed too much till the colours are rolled into form and vessels for water spirits as necessity and convenience snall direct reds carmine and lake it is rather difficult to procure either good carmine or good lake good cermine is inclined to the vermillion tint and should be an impalpable powder and good lake to the carmine tint the carmine crayons are prepared in the sollowing manner as their texture is inclinable to hardness instead of grinding and rolling them take à sufficient quantity of carmine lay it upon the grinding-stone mix it with levigating knife with spirits of wine till it becomes smooth and even yet the less friction produced by the knife the better the chalk-stone being ready lay the colour upon it to absorb the spirit but be careful that it is laid on in proper shape for painting the simple colour being prepared the next step is to compose the disserent tints by mixture with whiting the proportion to be observed consisting of twenty gradations to one which may be clearly understood by the following directions take some of the simple colour and levigate it with spirits of wine adding about one part of wasnied whiting to three parts of carmine of which when properly incorporated make two parcels the next gradation should be composed of equal quantities of carmine and whiting of which sour crayons may be made the third composition should have one fourth carmine and three fourths whiting of this make six crayons which will be good proportion with the rest the last tint should be made of whiting very faintly tinged with carmine of which make about eight crayons which will compleat the abovementioned proportion though these tints made with whiting may be rolled yet the pure carmine will not bear it but must he lest on the chalk-stone till persectly dry lake ls colour very apt to be hard to prevent which the student must observe the following particulars take about half the quantity of lake intended for the crayons and grind it very sine with spirits of wine let it dry and then pulverize it which is easily done if the lake is good then take the other half and grind it with spirits after which mix it with the pulverized lake and lay it out directly in crayons on the chalk the colour will not bear rolling the simple colour being thus prepared proceed with the compound crayons as directed before and in the same degrees of gradation as the carmine tints vermillion or native cinnabar the best is inclined to the carmine tint to prepare this colour mix it on the stone with soft water or spirits aster which it may be rolled into crayons blues prussian blue is colour very apt to bind and is rendered soft with more difficulty than carmine and lake the same method of preparation is to be followed with this as directed with respect to lake only it is necessary to grind à larger quan¬ tity of the pure colour as it is chiefly used for painting draperies blue verditer is colour naturally gritty and therefore it is necessary to wasni it well its particles are so coarse as to require some binding matter to unite them otherwise the crayons will never adhere together to accomplish this take quantity sufficient to form two or three crayons to which add piece of slacked plaister of paris about the size of pea mix these well together and form the crayons upon the chalk this blue is extremely brilliant and will be of great use in heightening draperies brilliant greens are produced with great difficulty which may be procured of those who make it their business to prepare them yet the following compositions will be found useful take yellow oker and after grinding it with spirits mix it with the powder of prussian blue then temper it with knife and lay the crayons on the chalk without rolling them besides this use king ’ yellow mixed with prussian blue brown oker and prussian blue the crayons made of these last may be rolled yellows king ’ yellow is the most useful and the most brilliant levigated with spirits of wine and compose the different tints as before directed yellow oker and naples yellow ground with spirits will make useful crayons orange is produced with king ’ yellow and vermillion ground together with spirits and the tints formed as in other cases but no great quantity of them is required browns cullens earth is sine dark brown after six or eight of the simple crayons are prepared several rich compound tints may be roman oker and prussian blue mixed in difserent proportions will be useful produced from it by mixture with carmine in various degrees black carmine and this colour mixed toget ier make useful tints for painting hair several gradations may be produced from each of these by mixture with whiting umber may be treated in just the same manner only it is necessary to levigate it with spirits of wine purples prussian blue ground with spirits and mixed with pulve¬ rized lake will produce good purple carmine thus mixed with prussian blue will produce purple something different from the former various tints may be made from either of these compounds by mixture with whiting black lamp-black is the only full black that can be used with safety as all others are subject to mildew cinnabar mixed with carmine-this is composition of great use and tints made from this with whiting will be found very serviceable carmine and black is another good compound of which five or six gradations should be made some partaking more of the black and others having the carmine most predomi¬ nant besides several tints by mixture with whiting cinnabar and black is also very useful compound from which several different tints should be made prussian blue and black is another good compound and will be sound of singular service in painting draperies it is impossible to lay down rules for forming every tint necessary composition set of crayons there being many accidental compositions entirely dependent on fancy and opinion the student should make it à rule to save the leavings of his colours for of these he may form various tints which will occasionally be useful rolling the crayons and disposing them for painting the different compositions of colours must be cut into proper magnitude after they are prepared in order to be rolled into pastils for the convenience of using them each crayon should be formed in the left hand with the ball of the right first formed cylindrically and then tapered at each end if the composition is too dry dip the finger in water if too wet the composition must be laid upon the chalk again to absorb more of the moisture the crayons should be rolled as quick as possible and when finished must be laid upon the chalk again to absorb all remaining moisture after the gradation of tints from one colour is formed the chalk and the grinding-stone should be well scraped and cleansed with water before it is used sor another colour when the set of crayons is compleated according to the rules prescribed they should be arranged in classes for the convenience of painting with them some thin drawers divided into number of partitions is the most convenient method of disposing them properly the crayons should be deposited according to the several gradations of light the bottom of the partitions must be covered with bran as bed for the colours because it not only preserves them clean but prevents their breaking the box made use of when the student paints should be about foot square with nine partitions in the upper corner on the left hand supposing the box to be in the lap when he paints let him place the black and grey crayons those being the most seldom used in the second partition the blues in the third the greens and browns in the first partition on the left hand of the second row the carmines lakes vermillions and all deep reds the yellows and orange in the middle and the pearly tints next and as these last are of very delicate nature they must be kept very clean that the gradations of colour may be eafily distinguished in the lowest row let the first partition con¬ tain piece of fine linen rag to wipe the crayons with while they are using the second all the pure lake and vermillion tints and the other partitions may contain those tints which from their complex nature can not be classed with any of the former encaustic painting tiis method of painting has been little practised in england for the information of the curious we give the following directions which will enable them to produce with ease picture in this very curious manner the first method is described in letter from mr. febroni the inventor published in maty review for mr. lewis of gottenbrun has lately executed picture according to my manner it is done upon wood prepared with wax and is remarkable for the vivacity and splendour of its colours believe have already mentioned to you in what this new manner consists you melt or rather dissolve some good white wax in naptha petrolei without colour till such time as the mixture has acquired by cool¬ ing the appearance of an oil beginning to freeze mix your colours in this and then keep them in small tin boxes ou dilute them more or less with the same naptha ac- cording as they dry or as you wisn to use them this painting allows time enough to give all the finishing you desire and if you wisfi to work in haste you may dry as fast as you please by exposing it to the heat when the picture is finished it is of that fine tone which is preferable to any varnish but if you choose varnisn only warm the picture and the naptha will evaporate when this is done you must wait till the picture cools when you must polishi it by rubbing it over neatly with cloth if vou wishi to have it still brighter you must melt white wax on the fire without suffering it to boil mix little naptha with this and draw layer of it over the picture already heated by means of brazier which you hold under if the picture is small or before it if it is large the colours at first appear spoiled but you restore them to their first beauty if when the layer of wax is cooled you polisn it by rubbing with cloth it is then that the colours take the high tone of oil lf vou fear the effect of fire for your picture you are to make soap of wax which is to be done by boiling white wax in water in which you have dissolved twentieth part naptha petrolei is bituminous kind of oil issuing out of certain rocks in the territory of modena there are three forts more or less pure and colourless of the weight of the wax of marine alkali or sel de sourde very pure rub your picture with this soap and when it is dry polish it as before-mentioned if you do not choose either of these methods give your painting its usual var- nisn of sandarac and spirit of turpentinc this method has been found preferable to all those that have been tried and superior to oil for the beauty of their colours there are many fine colours which can not be used in oil which may be made use of with great success in this method as the naptha entirely evaporates one may be asfured that this is the true method or painting in wax there is likewise much to hope for the duration of the pictures painted in this manner as wax is much less liable to altera¬ tion than oil and does not so easily part with its phlogiston the ancient grecian method of painting by emma jane greenland take an ounce of white wax and the same weight of gum mastick in lachrymae that is as it comes from the tree which must be reduced to coarse powder put the wax in glazed earthen vessel over very slow fire and when it is quite dissolved strew in the mastick little at time stirring the wax continually until the whole quantity gold pallet was on this occasion voted to emma jane greenland november by the society at london for the encouragement of arts manufactures and commerce of gum is persectly melted and incorporated then throw the paste into cold water and when it is hard take it out of the water wipe it dry and beat it in one of mr. wedgwood ’ mortars observing to pound it at first in linen cloth to absorb some drops of water that will remain in the paste and would prevent the possibility of reducing it to powder which must be so sine as to pafs through thick gauze it should be pounded in cold place and little while at à time as after long beating the friction will in degree soften the wax and gum and instead of their becoming powder they will return to paste make some strong gum arabick water and when you paint take little of the powder some colour and mix them together with the gui-water light colours require but à small quantity of the powder but more of it must be put in proportion to the body and darkness of the colours and to black there should be almost as much of the powder as colour having mixed the colours and no more than can be used before they grow dry paint with fair water as is practised in painting with water colours ground on the wood being first painted of some proper colour prepared in the same manner as is described for the picture walnut-tree and oak are the forts of wood commonly made use of in italy for this purpose the painting should be very highly finished otherwise when varnisned the tints will not appear united when the painting is quite dry with rather hard brush passing it one way varnisn it with white wax which is put into an earthen vessel and kept melted over very slow fire till the picture is varnissied taking great care the wax does not boil afterwards hold the picture before fire near enough to melt the wax but not make it run and when the varnissi is entirely cold and hard rub it gently with linen cloth should the varnisn blister warin the picture again very slowly and the bubbles will subside when the picture is dirty it need only be washied with cold water the venetian method of colouring by timothy sheldrake efa the method of painting practised in the venetian school ee the cloth was primed with colours in distember of brownisn hue such as would properly enter into the darkest parts of the picture the most transparent colours are the properest believe umber was most generally used broken with red vellow or blue according to the tint intended to be produced and diluted with chalk or whiting to the proper degree of strength upon the ground so prepared the subject was correcty drawn with umber pure or mixed with lake blue or black and with the same colours those shadows that were darker than the ground were then painted in the artist then painted the lights with pure white in solid body where the light was brightest or where the full effect of colour was to be produced and where the demi-tints were afterwards to be scumbling it thinner by degrees till it united with the shadows in this manner the chiaro-oscuro was finished as much as possible and the local colour of every object in the picture the greater silver pallet was voted to mr. sheldrake sor this disser- tation on painting in oil in by tne society instituted at london for the encouragement of arts manusactures and commerce glazed over it all the colours used in this part of the work were ground in oil which was absorbed into the ground the picture remaining flat something like picture in water-colours or crayons it was then varnissied till saturated with varniss and the full of every colour brought out the picture was then complete upon the most superficial view of this process it will be evident that picture painted by it is as to all visible pro¬ perties varnish picture for the small quantity of oil that had been used sunk into the ground and never could rise again to be hurtsul while the varnisn being laid on after the colours gave them all the brilliancy and durability they could derive from that vehicle without being liable to the objections that are made to painting in varnissi supposing it to be used in the same manner as oil is in painting with oil it is true that this mode of painting is itself liable to some objections these have endeavoured to obviate and shall therefore mention hereafter here it may be observed that as any varnisn may be used it is to this circuistance we must attribute the different degrees of durability in pictures of the venetian school have seen some that would resist the most powerful solvents while others were destroyed by the weakest though all possessed the apparent properties that distinguish the venetian pictures from all others as do not pretend to degrade painting to the rank of mechanical art that may be infallibly practised by receipt shall be permitted to observe that this was the general system of the venetian school wlich have seen variously modified in the works of different artists of that as well as of the flemissi which is derived froi it it is susceptible of an almost infinite number of modifications in proportion to the talents the judgment of and the objects to be painted by the artists who may adopt it this being the case if it is proved by experiment that effects similar to those of the venetian pictures may be produced by this method and that the system has strong tendency to produce that bril- liancy and harmony of colouring as is so much admired with more certainty and facility than those qualities can be obtained by any other mode of painting once afked sir joshua reynolds by what circumstances in the management of picture he thought the harmony of colouring was to be producedp he replied an unity of light and an unity of shadow should pervade the whole he explained to me the difficulty of reducing the various colours of all the objects that may be included in picture and the various modifications of those colours to the simple harmo- nious state he described and illustrated what he had said by this simile picture to possess harmony of colouring should look as if it was painted with one colour suppose umber and white and when the chiaro-oscuro was com¬ plete the colour of each object should be glazed over it observation from such authority was impressed with peculiar force on my mind and if can retrace its perations on fubject which has so long engaged my atten¬ tion should say sir joshua ’ observation was the clue that guided me through all my experiments and hope will enable me to prove that the beautiful and simple practice which he suggested as à simile was literally the practice of that school upon whose works his ideas of colouring were founded at the same time may observe that the fact seems to have eluded his observation or he would not have used it as comparison to simplisy his description of practice which he thought both difficult and complex in the newfonian doctrine of light and colours it is believed that all colours are inherent in light and are ren- dered visible by the action of various bodies which reflect particular rays and absorb the rest without disputing the truth of this doctrine it is to be obserred that painter must consider the objects he represents as being analogous to the materials he uses to represent them and in this view of the subject colour is to be considered as property inherent in bodies which is rendered visible by the contact of light colourless or at least mono- coloured substance and shadow the mere privation light picture may reprefent either groupe of figures or other objects in room or any objects in the open air whatever the situation may be it reprefents certain objects in given space possessing individually their peculiar colours and generally exposed to the operations of light the quantity of light each can receive must depend upon its form and its position respecting that part whence the light comes for in proportion as other parts recede fromn the light the shadow becomes visible but shadow is no¬ thing but privation of light and privation of colour in pro- portion as the light is diminished some attention to these circumstances will perhaps enable us to demonstrate the truth of sir joshiua ’ position if globe of one colour be exposed in painter ’ room properly darkened that part which is nearest the light will partake of its colour the next part will shew the true colour of the object that which first recedes from the light will be à little obscured the next little more and so on progressively till that part which is farthest from the light will lose its colour and appear equally dark with the shadiest part of the room now we know this globe is of one unifori colour the variations we see in disserent parts of it are only deceptions occasioned by the accession of light in some parts and the privation of it in others what is true of this one object and its parts would be equally true of any number of objects whatever their colours or relative situations might be if they were placed together in the same room each would possess its own indvidual colour each would partake of the general light in proportion to its situation and of the general darkness in proportion as it recedes from the light all this may be easily conceived but the difficulty and in the ordinary modes of painting ferious one it is is to represent such objects with the appearance of trutà and preserve the har- mony necessary to constitute whole the venetian painters however by whatever means they obtained their knowledge discovered method so simple that perhaps no other can produce such brilliant effects and undoubtedly not with facility and certainty at all comparable with their ’ the artist will remark that in describing the whole of the venetian method of painting have said nothing of the manner of producing those demi-tints which conduce so much to the brilliancy of picture which are so difficult to execute and in which he most frequently fails those tints are in the ordinary modes of painting produced by the mixture of black grey blue or brown according to the judgment of the artist with the local colours of the objects it is these tints which from their being made with such colours it is difficult to get clear and which never are so clear in any other as in the venetian and in some of the flemisn pictures which are painted upon ana- logous principles the fact is that those painters pro- duced all such tints without the admixture of any colour to represent them and by method so like that by which they are produced in nature that this circumstance alone ensures degree of brightness to their colours and of harmony to their shadows that it is perhaps impossible to produce in an equal degree by any other mode of painting it is à singular fact which have not skill in physies to be able to account for though by numerous experiments have ascertained beyond contradiction that if upon any degree of brown between the deepest and the lightest brown yellow we paint pure white in gradations from the solid body to the lightest tint that can be laid on all the tints between the solid white and the ground will appear to be grey intense in proportion to the depth of the ground and the thinnefs of the white laid upon it but in every case all the tints laid upon one ground will harmonize with each other and form one connected chain if may use the expression which will persectly unite the highest light with the darkest shade if then we examine the component substances of venetian picture we shall sind the lighter parts consist only of white to represent the light and of the local colours of the objects it represenis the demi-tints are imitated by an appearance almost as deceptive as the similar appearances in nature but in every other method of painting these demi-tints are produced by mixing some dusky colour with the local colours and the light the comparison of these inethods will afford demonstrative reason why the vene- tian must be brighter than any other mode of painting having shewn as near to à demonstration as the nature of the subject will perhaps admit why those parts of venetian picture that are connected with light and colours are brighter than the corresponding parts of any other pictures it remains to explain the cause of similar superi- ority in the darker parts of the same pictures it has been said with much confidence that as wlite represents light so black is the representative of darkness but though this may be true in physies it certainly is not so in painting for the painter ’ art is to represent objects as they appear in point of colour to be not as they really are thus if know an object is perfectly black and am to reprefent it as it appears to be at the distance of fisty feet black from the pallet will not produce good imitation of it because the interposition of sisty feet of the atmosphere will cause it to appear of colour disserent froi what it really is and vice versa if we go into cavern cellar or room so darkened that the colour of no object can be distinctly seen and if we there hold any solid black sub- stance near to the eye the disference will be visible at once the black object will be immdiately distinguished by its solidity and colour from the surrounding space and such remote objects as may be obscurely visible through it these objects actually possess their individual colours and only appear indistinctly from the absence of light the black object may appear solid and of that colour from its proximity to the eye but the circumjacent ones will appear of colour perfectly distinct from it more or less transparent in proportion to their distance from the eye and shewing portion of their individual colours according to the quantity of ill-defined light that may be admitted thus we see if may venture to mention so notorious à truism that shadows are nothing real they only seem to exist in the absence of light and give to objects an ill-defined appearance distinct from though in some instances mixed with light and colours in disserent degrees but as the painter must represent this appearance by something real he chooses the colours most analogous viz browns and the most transparent of their class to represent this transparent but imperfectly defined appear- ance in nature it has been supposed that the venetian painters had some peculiarly rich and transparent brown colour which is seen to pervade all the works of that school the effect of which no modern artist has been able to imitate and which therefore is supposed to have been lost is it not very probable that colour so common as to pervade the works of the worst as well as of the best artists of that school should be so unaccountably lost and as the effect attributed to it may be easily produced by the mode of painting have described it is not unreasonable to conclude that this much-lamented colour has never existed it is well known that chalk and other earths of the same kind lose when wetter much of their whitenefs and become semi-transparent it is equally certain that if umber or other earths are mixed with chalk and saturated with varnisn after they are laid on the cloth they in like manner become diaphanous and are infinisely more bril- liant than the same colours can be when mixed with white lead and oil this seems on good grounds to have been the basis of the venetian method of painting and all its peculiar efsects at least if may draw any conclusion srom the numerous experiments have made but if artists whose talents will enable them to repeat those experiments to the hest advantage should be induced to do so the fact will be determined in the most satisfactory manner may now be permitted to say it is difficult if not impossible to conceive à theory more simple more beauti- ful or more true than that of sir joshua reynolds it is certainly impossible to form practice more simple or more conformable to that theory than the one have described as will be evident on recapitulating the particulars the artist having determined what hue should pervade his picture formed his ground with that colour prepared in distemper upon this the subject was drawn and the darker shades painted in with transparent colours which sunk into the ground with pure white he then painted in all the lights and demi-tints and lastly glazed in the colours each in its place upon applying the varnisn the darker shades were as to body incorporated with the ground and thus though different in colour appeared thinner and more transparent than any colours could be when laid upon any ground the sull effect of every colour was brought out and the picture was complete whoever has been accustomed to paint or to mark the progrefs of painting in the common way and will reslect on the practice of the method have described by artisis who had been brought up to it must see that such artists would paint with degree of facility expedition and certainty as to effect that could never be equalled in the ordinary way of painting in oil besides it will be evident that an artist would not onsy paint picture himself with more facility but if he had occasion could employ number of subordinate artists upon large works and put those works out of hand with more uniformity as to merit and effect than if he were to employ such affistants in similar works if they were to be painted in the common way am sensible how litile attention will and perhaps ought to be paid to observations on painting if made by those who are not professionally artists for practical men acquire kind of knowledge that can never be obtained in any other way but at the same time they contract preju- dices that often prevent them from sully investigating any novelty in practice that may be offered to their notice the speculative man on the contrary who investigates the properties of matter unshackled by practical preju dices and with ideas purely chemical or philosophical will be more likely to ascertain all the facts relative to any theory that may become the object of enquiry in this way hope have proceeded in this investigation have endeavoured to consider pictures as masses of matter pos¬ sessing the properties but differing from each other in degree of brilliancy transparency and duration ought perhaps here to take leave of the subject but it may be expected that should give an account of the manner in which the pictures were painted have already mentioned that there are some difficulties in the method of painting have described as being that of the old artists and which would form objections of considerable force to the practice of it by artists who are well acquainted with the usual modes of painting these difficulties are first the ground absorbs the oil from the colours so fast that they are not so manageable as in oil- painting secondly the effect of the picture is not seen till the finishing varnish is laid on and thirdly as the effect is not seen till the picture is finished it will some¬ times disappoint the artist and in that case it will be dif- ficult if at all practicable to alter it as believe the process have described in the beginning of this paper is similar to that of miss provis the artists who are acquainted with her recipe can afcertain whether my conjectures on this subject are right or not am certain at least that these difficulties occurred in my attempts to paint and to obviate them adopted the sol¬ lowing process prepared the ground in distemper and painted the dark parts in the way have described then varnisned the ground with the copal oil-varnissi till it was fully saturated and by this means the full effect of that part of the picture was seen upon this painted the lighter parts with white using much of the vehicle where the colour was thin and little in the folid parts leaving the white in them dead by this means understood the effect of my chiaro oscuro as saw the effect of the demi-tints nearly as well as when the picture was finished upon this glazed the colours in the way have described in the beginning of this and finished the picture often found probably from want of practice that the effect was different from what intended as the effect of the colours added to that of the chiaro ofcuro produced an essential alteration in the whole as took care in general that the defect did not arise from too much white added more where it was deficient and glazed freshn colours over it which united perfectly with what had been done before and did not give the appearance of mended picture if the defect was from too much white glazed on it colour similar to that of the ground painted with fresn white upon that and glazed the proper colours over it in this way sound could alter the picture but not so well as in the former case found could when necessary increase the effect of the picture by painting on the principal mass or maffes of light with the local colours only mixed with white as this practice brought those parts more forward by making them appear solid and thus contrasting them with the transparency of the rest of the picture in this way could use the colours tempered with copal varnissi without difficulty and believe that if had been accustomed to paint large pictures could have painted one as large as lise with the same ease method and process or transferring paintings by mr. robert salmon. the first thing to be attended to either for paintings on plaster walls or ceilings or from boards is that the place in which they are be secure from wet or damp if the paintings are on old walls in large buildings and places where this can not be aftained by art then the summer season should be taken for the purpose as the picture would rarely escape damage if the wet or damp gets at it while under the process at the same time caution should be taken that the room or place be not over-heated which would also produce equally bad effects these precautions taken the next thing is to examine the face of the paint- ing if there are any holes in the same they must be carefully filled up with paste or putty of glue and whiting this if the holes are large should be twice or thrice done so as to entirely fill up and leave the face even and smooth but if there are any bruised places with paint still remaining the great silver pallet was voted to mr. robert salmon sor this discovery by the society sor the encouragement of arts manufactures and commerce dec. the face of the bruised parts then this stopping must not be applied but the securing canvass hereaster described be pressed down into these places in the places that are stopped there will of course appear blemishies when the picture is transferred but the process is rendered much more certain and sure by being so done attention must next be paid to lay down any blisters or places where the paint is leaving the ground this is done by introdueing between the paint and the ground some very strong paste of slour and water and the face of the blistered paint being damped with wet sponge or pencil it may then be pressed with the hand home to the ground to which it will then adhere all the unsound places being thus secured care must be taken to clear the face of any grease or dirt as also of any particles of the paste that may happen to be left on the surface the next thing is to determine the size of the painting meant to be taken off and if on plain surface board of the size of the picture must be procured of not less than an inch in thickness and framed together with well-seasoned wood in small pannels smooth and flushi on one side this done piece of fine open canvass must be provided such as the finest sort used for hanging paper on this canvass to be made somewhat larger than the picture and so sewed together and the seam pressed that it be persectly smooth and even this is what call the securing-canvass which being so prepared is then stuck on the face of the picture with paste made of strong beer boiled till it is half reduced and then mixed with sufficient quantity of flour to give it very strong consist- ence to large pictures on walls or ceilings the canvass must for some time be pressed and rubbed with the hand as smooth as possible working it from the middle to the out- side so as to make it tolerably tight and observing as it dries to press it with the hand or cloth into any hollow or bruised places so that it may adhere to every part of the painting this done it is left to dry which it will mostly do in day or two when dry second canvass of stronger and closer sort and of the same size as the other is in like manner to be attached on the top of the first this last will want very little attention as it will readily adhere to the first and being dry attention must be paid to the face thereof to take off any small knots or uneven¬ nefs thereon which done the whole should be again covered with thin paste of size and whiting when dry to be pumiced over so as to make the whole perfectly smooth and even the painting being thus secured the board already prepared to the size of the picture is to be put with the smooth side against the face thereof so as exactly to cover as much as is-intended to be transferred the edges of the canvass which as before directed are left larger than the painting are then to be pulled tight over and closely nailed to the edge of the board if the painting be large either on ceiling or walls the board must by proper supports be firmly fixed against the picture so that it can readily be lowered down when the plaster and painting is detached the canvass and board being fixed the paintings from walls or ceilings are to be freed together with certain portion of the plastering this with proper care and atten¬ tion may be readily done if on ceiling the first thing is to make some holes through the plastering round the outside of the board and painting and with small saw to saw the plastering from one hole to another till the whole is disunited from the other parts of the ceiling this done the workman must get at the upper side of the ceiling where he must free the plastering from the laths by break- ing off the keys thereof and with chissel cut out the laths whereby the plastering together with the picture will be left resting on the board and supports if there be apartments over the ceiling the readiest way will be to take up sew of the floor boards above if next the roof means may always be found to get into the fame and although at first this operation may appear difficult vet it is presumed no difficulty will be found by any ingenious workman if the painting is on brick or stone wall the same must be cut away at top and down the sides of the painting and then by means of chissels or saws in wood handles of different lengths the wall must be cut away quite behind the painting leaving the same together with the plaf¬ tering resting on the board this operation may sometimes be done with saw or if the wall be not thick nor the other side of much consequence the bricks or stones may be taken out from that side leaving the plastering and painting as before this last method have not practised the other of cutting away some part of the wall have and see no difficulty or very great labour in the operation but that of course must be various according to the texture of the wall and mortar if paintings are on curved furfaces such as the coves of ceilings then the only difference of operation is that some ribs of wood must be cut out and boarded smooth to the eurve of the surface of the painting and then fixed up thereto in place of the before described bearing board the painting is then to be freed and left with the plastering resting on the bearers for paintings painted on wainscot or boards the same securing and process is exactly followed only that as the wainscot or board can always be cut to the size wanted or laid horizontal the securing canvass is stretched thereon and turned over the edges of the same till it is dry after which the edges are again turned up and nailed to the board in the same manner as those from walls having as before described in any of the aforementioned cuses freed the paintings from their original places you have then got them secured to two thicknesses of canvass with their faces next and on to the board prepared for that purpose which being the case they can readily be re- moved to any room or shop to be finishied as sollows having got the painting into the shop or room which should be moderately warm and dry but by no means over¬ heated laying the board on bench or tressels the back of the picture will be uppermost and the plastering or wood as may happen is then to be cleared away leaving nothing but the body of paint which will be firmly attached to the securing canvass to perform this large rasp narrow plane and chissels will he requisite this operation is dif- ficult to describe but would soon be learnt by any one who makes the attempt nor is it very tedious and being per- formed the picture is ready to be attached to its new can¬ vass as follows the painting being cleared and laying on the board the back thereof is to be painted successively three or four times over with any good strong-bodied paint leaving each coat to dry before the other comes on day or two between each will generally be found sufficient each of these coats and particularly the first should be laid on with great care taking but small quantity in the brushi at time and laying it very thin this precaution is necessary to prevent any of the oil or paint from searching through any small cracks or holes that may happen to be in the face of the picture which would run into the paste and so attach the securing canvass to the picture as to prevent its being afterwards got off if any of these holes or cracks are observed they should be stopped up with the glue and whiting paste and the painting then repeated till com¬ plete coat is formed on the back of the picture and it is then ready for attaching to its canvass which is done by spreading all over the picture à paste made of copal varnissi mixed with stiff white lead and small quantity of any other old fat paint all which being spread equally over with pallet knife such canvass as the first securing- canvass is laid thereon and strained and nailed round the edges of the board in which state it is left till it becomes tolerably dry and then second canvass of stronger fort must be in like manner attached on the first and left till it is perfectly dry and hard this mostly takes about two months and the louger it is left the more secure the painting will be attached to its canvass and less liable to crack or sly therefrom when sufficiently dry all the four canvasses are to be unnailed from the board and the edges turned up the reverse way and nailed to proper stretching frame this is done by unnailing from the board part on each side at à time and immediately nailing it to the stretching frame so as never to leave the canvass to rack or partially stretch which would damage the picture in this manner by degrees the cloths are entirely detached from the board and firmly fixed on the stretching frame the superfluous left larger than the frame may then be cut off and the wedges put in the frame and moderately tightened up there remains then only to clear the face of the painting from the securing canvass which is done by repeatedly washing the face with sponge and moderately warm water in doing this no force or violence must be used with frequent and gentle wasnings the paste will all worked out with the sponge the edges of the outer canvass is then to be cut round and stripped off and the other next the face of the picture is to be done in like manner which done there only remains to clear the paste clean off and repair any desects and the picture will be as strong as if painted on the canvass for taking pictures off walls without taking the walls down or cutting away more thereof than the plastering the following process is proposed the face of the picture to be first secured in every respect in the manner before described instead of the plain board bearer should be prepared with convex surface composed of ribs hoarded over so as to form part of cylinder of not less than five seet radius and as long as the height of the picture this bearer being prepared in order to apply it floor or platform should be erected and placed horizontally with its surface level and its edge immediately in contact with thie bottoin of the picture meant to be transferred the use of this platformn is for the above-described bearer to rest and move upon which bearer should be set on its end with one edge in contact with the wall at one side of the picture consequently the other edge will be at some distance from the wall according to the size of the picture and convexity of the bearer being thus placed the super- fluous edge of the securing-canvass should be turned over and nailed to that edge of the bearer that is next the wall this done the operation of cutting away the plastering should be begun which may be done with the corner and end of fhort saw by sawing between the brick-work and plastering leaving the thick ness or part of the thicknefs of the plastering on to the painting fastened to the bearer and when this edge of the picture is fieed the whole height for nine or ten inches under the edge of the bearer that is furthest from the wall must then be gently forced nearer consequently the other edge together with the painting and plaster that is freed will leave the wall and give an opportunity of introdueing the saw behind and cutting away the same to certain distance further under and by repeating this the whole of the picture will at last be freed and left on the bearer each time the bearer is removed and as it is were rolled on the vertical surface of the wall care must be taken to turn and nail the securing- canvass on the top and bottom edges of the bearer so as to secure the freed plastering and picture from moving about and lastly before the bearer and painting be moved to nail the other edge of the picture in the same way which will secure the whole to the bearer this done the picture and bearer are at liberty to be moved to proper place in order to be freed from the remaining plaster the edges may then be unnailed and the painting and canvass slipped from this bearer on to plain board and the new canvass then put on and remain till dry as in other cases it may appear that the bending of the canvass and plaster- ing to the convex bearer will crack the plaster and damage the painting but from experience have observed that to curve of such or even less radius plastering will bend without any visible crack even on the exterior part thereof and that part next the bearer not having occasion in bend¬ ing to extend its parts will confequently be much less liable to be disturbed by such bending
