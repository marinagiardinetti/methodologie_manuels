the works of the late professor camper the connexion between the science of anatomy and statuary the arts of drawing painting in two books containing treatise on the natural difference of features in persons of different countries and periods of life and on beauty as exhibited in ancient sculpture with nei method of sketching heads national features and portraits of individuals with accuracy illustrated with seventeen plates explanatory of the professor ’ leading principles translated from the dutch by cogan london printed for dilly in the poultry the transtator that an intimate connexion subsists between the different branches of the arts and sciences by virtue of which the one elucidates or reflects lustre upon the other is truth that has never been litigated the artist whose attention is solely confined to one particular object and whose knowledge is as circumscribed as his employment may become expert in the mechanic or operative part of his occupation but we are not to expect from him any con- siderable improvements or peculiar indications of taste nor will he be qualified to propose rules by which others might be taught to excel to none of the fine arts are those observations more applicable than to those of painting and sculpture for none require larger compass of knowledge or deeper insight into nature if the artist means to carry the pro- ession farther than the mechanic delineation of an object that is immediately before him as the painter or statuary who has made the human figure the peculiar object of his study has doubtless given the preference to the most interesting and the most sublime de- partment so it must be confessed that he has chosen the this branch demands most difficult and comprehensive great extent of historical knowledge an intimate acquain- tance with national characteristics great attention to the diversities occasioned by progressive years and peculiarities of sex observance of the effects produced by the passions upon the human frame in their various combinations and different degrees of force superadded to such knowledge of anatomy as shall enable him to delineate the general situation of the muscles in placid and inert state their action in varied positions and their influence in describing every emotion or passion of the mind it is also the branch most exposed to the severity of criticism as grosser faults in the representation of the human form are readily detected and as numbers presuming that they have complete model in their own persons or competent knowledge from their intercourse with their species affect the refined connoisseur and attempt to support the character by searching for minuter blemissies the delineation of different animals does not require an equal extent and variety of knowledge and those who have made this branch their principal study have in general con- fined themselves to close imitation yet the ill success of many painters in this department the few masters comparatively who have acquired celebrity and the very few whose works are exempt from grofs imperfections too clearly indicate that there are latent difficulties which it is not in the power of mere imitation to furmount and also that the address ac- quired simply by attention and practice in the delineation of one particular species has rather been an impediment than an aid in attempts to delineate animals of any other species much pains have been taken to remove those various difficulties men of study and of genius have attempted to introduce certain principles and to propose invariable rules which they deemed conducive to the improvement of taste in the higher branches of painting and precifion in all some of the principles advanced and methods recommended have been of considerable service while others as they were built upon false dogmas are more calculated to mis- lead than to direct into the right path the work which is now introduced to the english reader professes to remove several remaining difficulties of no small moment and to propose rules more conducive to facility grace and accuracy than any hitherto offered these professions are founded upon the discovery of much more immediate and intimate connexion between the sciences of human and comparative anatomy and of the natural history of animals with the art of delineation than could have been supposed to exist every idea in it that is pe- culiar to the author exemplifies in very striking manner the truth of our remark concerning the connexion that subsists between different branches of the arts and sciences by means of which the one may be rendered in various respects sub- servient to the other the happy union in the same person of profound knowledge in anatomy with taste for draw- ing has demonstrated that the minutiae of anatomical know- ledge are much more conducive to elegance character expression and precision than could possibly have been imagined by any one totally ignorant of or but superficially acquainted with the science whenever the attention of artists has been directed to anatomical instructions it has hitherto been confined to the first series of muscles or their operation in the different actions or positions of the body as marked through the integuments but we now perceive the great importance of ofteology particularly an intimate knowledge of the bones constituting the cranium and of their relative situations in the delineation of national characters and in the changes made by advancing age and also its uses in the production of ideal beauty or in marking the eculiarities which characterise individuals neurology also which has not been considered as having the most distant relation to the subject is proved to be of high utility in the representation of the emotions of the mind an attainment confessedly the most difficult as well as the most interesting and sublime the acumen with which professor camper has criticised the labours of the most distinguissied painters and delineators of animals the detection of their errors and the causes of them the rules given to avoid these errors and acquire greater precision in delineating animals of different species founded upon comparative anatomy and the natural history of the animal indicate no less forcibly the great advantages to be derived by these two sciences which united promise to point out an unerring road to excellence the introductory discourse will acquaint the reader with the methods by which these discoveries were made it will also make him acquainted in pleasing and satisfactory manner with the progressive history of an inquisitive mind from early years up to manhood the dissatisfaction that ac- companied increased penetration and an improved taste the imperfections with which some modern productions of celebrated masters were chargeable the means pursued to avoid similar imperfections and to imitate those excellencies in the works of the antients which are the subjects of uni- versal admiration though the causes of this admiration had never been investigated the reader will further notice that the principles advanced are not the premature fruits of à warm imagination but that they were gradually formed by the observations and experience of series of years until they became the basis of sound criticism and furnissied rules for accurate execution it may not be impertinent to add that the professor ’ remarkable proficiency in drawing though it was simply the amusement of his leisure moments cor- roborates all that has been advanced concerning the superi- ority of his methods to those in common use of this pro- ficiency the connoisseur may form some judgment from the pecimens before him which are faithful as well as elegant copies of engravings from original drawings the greater part of which were executed under the inspection of the pro- fessor and all of them by the first artist in the seven pro- vinces by this application of his professional knowledge to his favourite amusement he had acquired such facility and firmness in delineation as astonissied every attendant on his public lectures and artists themselves have acknow- ledged that his occasional and extemporaneous sketches ex- ceeded in taste and accuracy their laboured productions the first book of this work contains the substance of several lectures which were read at different times and distant periods before the academy of drawing establissied at amsterdam these were afterwards revised and digested into à regular essay and carefully prepared for publication by professor camper himself it may perhaps be thought by those who admit the truth and importance of his leading principles that the distinctions given in the first chapter con- erning the characteristic differences of different nations are too general and not sufficiently adapted to assist the painter in describing that vast variety of national distinctions ob- servable in the different inhabitants of our globe but we are to recollect that those are proposed simply as specimens of new study the prosecution of which would promise the greatest advantages to the national and historical painter the grand object was to shiew that national differences may be reduced to rules of which the different directions of the facial line form fundamental norma or canon -- that these directions and inclinations are always accompanied by corres- pondent forin size and position of other parts of the cranium the knowledge of which will prevent the artist from blend- ing the features of different nations in the same individual and enable him to give that true character to national figures introduced into composition which has always been felt as beauty and the want of it as defect though the cause has lain concealed this subject may justly be considered as new and interesting study in the natural history of man which requires the joint labours of physiologists to surmount all the difsiculties attending it it is alone by forming very large collection of the craniums of different people that discrimination can be made between what is general from to the diversities observable in individuals from that which is national and characteristic of particular people the other articles minutely treated in this book relative to new manner of drawing portraits in profile according to certain rules deduced from the conformation of the cranium and the changes made by age being founded upon indubitable professor blumenbach of gottingen is pursuing this study with great affi¬ duity he has already published two decades of differences in the craniums of different people the transtator has only been able to procure the first from which he learns that the specimens in the possession of this professor led him in some sev instances to differ from prosessor camper respecting characteristie marks as each has formed his opinion from the specimens in his possession thcse differences manifest the difficulties hinted above and prove that further investigations alone will enable us to distinguish between accidental forms and iational marks principles can not be subject to similar incertitude so that respecting these every student has the means of making great improvement completely in his power the great utility of the remarks concerning the beauties of the antients will be self-apparent the contents of our second book are the small remains of lectures upon other subjects relative to drawing the ideas of which suggested themselves while the professor was engaged in the pursuit of his first object they were col- lected from imperfect manuscripts and detached hints found among the profeffor ’ papers after his decease and publishied by his son in as complete à manner as circumstances would allow of consequence they are merely to be considered as notes and heads of lectures the substance of which was given extempore this will sufficiently explain the reason why the scientific introductions appear so disproportionate to the explanatory parts it must also be noticed that at the time these lectures were delivered the audience enjoyed the great advantage of seeing every part of the subject explained by great variety of extemporaneous fketches which were successively effaced from the board to make room for others those communicated to the public are the only ones to which the professor had given permanency and of these the sketches illustrative of the passions were too imperfect to be given as they were found the engraver was obliged to supply some strokes that had been omitted all the other drawings were sufficiently accurate not to require additions or alterations we are informed that professor camper had range his ideas with more accuracy form each lecture into distinct treatise and illustrate the positions advanced by regular series of drawings but upon recess from the aca- demy at franiker public affairs engaged his immediate at- tention during the political troubles in holland until death terminated every sublunary pursuit although from the above causes the lectures on the manner of delineating the different passions and on the points of similarity between quadrupeds birds and fishies founded upon this similarity are necessarily imperfect and have claim to the indulgence due to fragments and rough sketches yet they may be deemed valuable acquisition to professor camper died at the hague in the vear painter they abound with sound criticismn and furnish hints which promise peculiar advantage to the delineator of the human passions or of objects in the animal kingdom and they will greatly assist the connoisseur in judging of the accuracy and merits of performance in this department of painting in word the principles and hints advanced contain valuable germs the development of which promises an abundance of rich fruit to the intelligent artist it was the celebrity of these lectures in holland that made them attract the translator ’ notice and conviction of the truth and great utility of the principles advanced in them made him wish that the artists and connoisseurs in great britain should enjoy the advantages to be derived from them but he had every reason to apprehend that they would remain deprived of these unless the work was under- taken by himself to competent acquaintance with both languages the knowledge of anatomy was also necessary for the translation of treatise of this kind and through the presumption that every other person in the seven provinces possessing thefe requisites might be engaged in more impor¬ tant employmients or be destitute of leisure he has imposed siderations to submit to à labour which has not been very agreeable to translate has always appeared to him like treading with slow and tedious pace over another man ’ ground after the eye has been satisfied with the prospect and with looking at every object composing it but in this business he had to work his way through very intricate subject an involved stile for the professors pen is by no means equal to his pencil and through the still greater dif- ficulty of an erroneous edition where the very numerous faults in the references presented perpetual embarrassments he claims to himself some degree of merit from this instance of self-denial and urges it as plea for indulgence to any in- cidental errors from which it is scarcely possible for work of this kind to be totally exempt great attention has been paid to perspicuity and every idea peculiar to the author has been faithfully rendered but the translator has thought himself at liberty to make some de- viations of trivial nature in order to accommodate the work to the englishi reader of which the following are the principal paraphrastical or explanatory descriptions are sometimes added particularly in the references to the five first plates of the first book the professor had uniformly confined himself to the concise algebraic mode but this conciseness and scientific appearance were frequently purchased by the loss of perspicuity and painful abstractions explanations are therefore subjoined until the reader familiarized with the subject and with the figures will no longer require them in the lectures that complimentary stile which the dutch literati still retain in all their public harangues particularly in the exordium and at the close is considerably retrenched as it would be displeasing to an english ear accustomed to greater simplicity the two first lectures are in the translation comprised in one since they related to the same subject as they were delivered they were of the usual length but from the causes already mentioned they were rendered too concise in the publication to require à separation in the translation two publications given at different periods are contracted into one volume not much larger than either of the original volumes this has been effectuated by the rejection of an essay on the principles of beauty vhich contained the substance of three lectures which had also been read before the academy and which the editor had subjoined to his second volume this essay would not have conveyed the same information to the englishi reader it might have done to the audience as mr camper had professedly adopted the theory of mr. burke with which we may suppose every englissiman of taste to be familiar al- though it displays considerable erudition yet this is mostly employed to exemplify the sentiments advanced in the chap- ter on beauty the translator was therefore unwilling to destroy the uniformity of work entirely of practical nature and replete with important rules by subjoining speculations which had no immediate relation to practice and which would have appeared defective to every one who has read the treatise of mr. burke or the more recent publica- tion of the rev mr. alison the subject of the notes will sufficiently sliew whether they were by the professor or his editors excepting the one in the page should the remark it contains be im¬ pertinent the fault is not to be attributed to the professor if the principles advanced and illustrated in the following pages should appear to english artists and connoisseurs as important as they did to their author and to his admirers in the dutch netherlands the translation can not be unac- ceptable in country so renowned for its painters as great britain they apparently open new sources of improvement and point out to younger artists new path for generous emulation it has been acknowledged by those who fre- quent the many exhibitions of paintings in the metropolis that somethiing of languor is taking place from kind of uniformity that threatens to be prevalent the eye of the visitor is fatigued with viewing repetition of the beauties of the preceding year and the most benevolent critic is wearied of repeating the same accents of praise in their ap- probation of excellencies which being no longer novel have lost much of their power to charm will it be too sanguine an expectation if the hope be indulged that the following publication will inspire artists with fresh vigour by pointing out to them unbeaten tracts enabling them to infuse unusual spirit dignity and character into some of their performances and by teaching them to avoid in others those inaccuracies which have been perpetuated by an im- plicit confidence in the rules and examples of the most cele- brated masters may we not presume also that some con- of painting will be animated to pursue the subject to greater extent and complete à study which professor camper has so happily begun and thus procure honour and emolu- ment to himself by multiplying the sources of delight to every man of taste introduction painting and whatever is relative to the art have been my favourite amusements from my earliest years and as the characteristic differences in men and animals ap- peared to me the most interesting objects in nature was disposed to pay more than ordinary attention to these — to draw and to model in clay were the recreations of my childisn hours as grew older was particularly struck with the figure and colour of the moors and with the dif- ference in features and complexion between the east indian- blacks and the natives of africa whenever copied after the best models of the ancient greeks — drew the head of pythian apollo venus de medicis hercules of farnese or placed before me the beautiful figures of michael angelo quesnoi and other cele- brated masters of later date lobserved very great difference between the faces of these and our own perceived also that they were much more pleasing than any of the figures of the flemishi schools without being able to ascertain in what this preference might consist had learned to make use of ovals and triangles accord- ing to the principles laid down in every treatise on the art of drawing and yet when copied from models in plaster from paintings or from life always experienced not only difficulty but an absolute impossibility of sketching heads to advantage nor was satisfied with the proportions recom- mended at sixteen years of age began to paint in oil-colours chiefly after the flemish masters but as was already cap- tivated with the superior dignity observable in the antique models the style of these masters was not agreeable to me at the age of eighteen my instructor charles moor the younger to whose attention and care am indebted for any subsequent progress may have made in this art set me to paint one of the beautiful pieces of van tempel in which there was the figure of moor that by no means pleased me in his colour he was black but his features were european as could neither please myself nor gain any roper directions desisted from the undertaking by cri- tically examining the prints taken from guido reni ma- at seb ricci and rubens observed that they in painting the countenances of the eastern magi had like van tempel painted black men but they were not moors the celebrated engraver cornelius visscher was the only one who appeared to me to have followed nature and to have properly characterized moors as advanced in years my attention and penetration in- creased and imagined that by single glance of the eye was able to distinguish antiques and to mark from the style the very period in which they were executed the majo- rity of prints taken from the most beautiful engravings on representations of the roman emperors by hub goltz pub- lishied in the year which is otherwise fine piece and in nis græciæ ejusque insularum and asiae min numis¬ mata although in some few of them the greek style is more or lefs preserved in the work of tristan comment hist contenant en abrege les vies eloges des empereurs jusques pertinax the antique is entirely lost through the unskilfulness of designers and engravers this observation is applicable to beger bonannus but the numismata in the thesaurus græc antig of gronovius and those of sicily naples of gravius and burmann are the most intolerable of all in the works of mountfaucon spon the designs were made by artists of very moderate talents and are ac- cordingly very imperfect this could not offend the editors as their attention was totally confined to the historical branch and they could neither perceive nor relish transcendent beauty which however did not escape the notice of baron stosch notwithstanding that picart has generally spoiled it by his vicious taste count caylus though good designer has failed in this respect barbault has in few instances suc- ceeded incomparably well it was not before had formed the plan of this treatise in the year that enjoyed the opportunity of consult- ing the excellent observations of winkelman on the imitation of the greeks in painting and sculpture his preliminary discourse concerning the art of designing among the an- tients and his monuments of antiquity have since stu- died his works with the utmost advantage although his no¬ netrating observer terms ideal is in fact founded upon the of the human countenance the dissertation of tenkate upon ideal beauty has great merit but it does not instruct us in its true nature or principles following lomazzo he has been missed by him they are both embarrassed by adopting the rules which constitute the harmony of music and which are not applicable to painting as the beauty of the latter does not depend upon certain immutable proportions but on other circumstances the excellent letter of my esteemed friend the profound hemsterhuys teaches us the influence of the beautiful upon gedanken uber die nachahmung der griekischen werke in der mahlereij und bildhauerkunst trattato preliminare dell arte dell disegno degli antichi popoli monumenti antichi inediti the mind but it does not indicate in what beauty consists or propose rules by which we may trace or produce it in the figure of objects have examined the works of natter mariette and the cabinet of the duke of orleans and in all of these have remarked manner and also deficiency of that taet which it is the object of these works to inspire even winkelman is destitute of it in execution so difficult is it to catch the spirit of the antients as long as the causes of their excellen- cies are not investigated and reduced to principles although albert durer was in reality great master and when we advert to the age in which he flourished we must allow him to have possessed extraordinary merit yet he has laid the foundation of bad taste which has diffused itself all over europe not excepting italy and which continues to exert its pernicious influence as is manifest from lomazzo who follows him implicitly excepting in the doctrine of mu- ical harmony being applicable to painting it is also obvi- us that lomazzo has consulted pomponius gauricus de sculp¬ tura and dolce as well as durer blind at thirty years of age this man was obliged to seek à subsistence by his ritings hence his numerous publications most of which fines the beautiful il bello per cosi dire non bello che par la sola sua bellezza the beautiful so to express myself trattato della pittura pag is merely beautiful by its own beauty — how extra- vagant to return must further remark that the excellent prints from the works of rafael poussin titian and pietra testa pleased me much better than the finest pieces of rubens or van dyck in both of which the divisions of albert durer and the imperfections of his oval were very conspicuous this is particularly the case in the painting of the holy vir- gin and child in the celebrated gallery at dusseldorp which is in every other respect an excellent performance by frequently modelling in clay after the finest heads of antiquity learnt that albert durer by looking at the object with both his eyes had made them too broad and also learnt that painter to excel must be proficient in model- ling as well as in drawing this will best enable him to form genuine idea of the real form of all objects knowledge of optics is also requisite as has been fully proved in my inaugural dissertation in separate chapter on the constituent beauty of forms shall hereafter show how much depends upon avoiding defective manner of viewing the object which is occasioned by the refraction of the rays of light in order to succeed it is also necessary to attend to the excellent rule of lyfip- publishied in the year it treats of the construction of the eye and the nature of vision introduction pus to make the head somewhat less the body more slender and delicate than they really are and they will be represented to greater advantage than by the most scrupulous exactitude when gave lectures in the public college at amsterdam as professor of anatomy found by comparing bodies of va- rious ages that were brought to me for dissection that the oval was not calculated for the delineation of the features ith any degree of accuracy or expedition with this idea sawed several heads both of men and of animals perpen- dicularly through the middle and was fully convinced that the ball of the head forming the cavity destined to contain the brains was in general very uniform but that the position of the upper and lower jaws was the manifest cause of the most striking differences the same observation may be ex- tended from quadrupeds down to the finny race and it has suggested hints sufficiently numerous to form separate treatise the above examination has also enabled me to discover whence those changes arise which progressively take place in our features from infancy to the most advanced age but still was unable to explain in what manner it was that the greeks should have acquired at very remote period that capita minora faciendo quam antiqui corpora graciliora siccioraque per quæ proceritas signorum major videretur — ab illis factos quales essent homines se quales viderentur esse plin lib xxxiv cap viii sect pag and dignified expression which they gave to their figures and which have never seen perfectly equalled erceived moreover that in the copies taken from these the facial line did not differ from our own this will appear by comparing the figure of plate which is the head of augustus caesar engraved by dioscorides with the first figure of the second plate having contemplated the inhabitants of various nations with greater-attention conceived that striking difference was occasioned not merely by the position of the inferior form of this maxilla this idea was confirmed by contem- plating considerable collection which afterwards made of heads that acknowledged various countries for their parents or of exact copies from them exclusive of several skulls of my countrymen and of the adjacent nations possess two of english negroes the one was young person the other ad- vanced in years — the head of female hottentot of an inhabitant of mogul —à chinese — youth of madagascar celebean — and finally the cranium of calmuck that is of eight different nations when was at oxford in the year also took sketch of the lower jaw of native of otaheite that had been brought over by captain king have never been able to obtain possession of the cranium of native american nor even of an anglo-american which has however some pecu- liarities that were pointed out to me by that celebrated artist mr. west of which as he was born in pennsylvania he was the best qualified to judge their face is long and narrow and the socket of the eye surrounds the ball in so close manner that no space is allowed for large upper eye-lid which is so graceful to the countenance of most europeans when in addition to the skull of negro had procured one of calmuck and had placed that of an ape contiguous to them both observed that line drawn along the fore- nead and the upper lip indicated this difference in national physiognomy and also pointed out the degree of similarity between negroe and the ape by sketching some of these eatures upon horizontal plane obtained the lines which mark the countenance with their different angles when made these lines to incline forwards lobtained the face of an antique backwards of negroe still more backwards the lines which mark an ape dog snipe .— this disco- very formed the basis of my edifice the large and populous city of amsterdam moreover af- forded me various opportunities of collecting the skulls and other bones of the deceased in regular progrefsion from arliest infancy up to decrepit age by comparing these with ach other my thoughts were directed to the natural differ- ence occasioned by the gradual growth of the parts in youth and their decay in advanced age and also to the manner by vhich this discrepancy of years might be most accurately de- lineated hence arose the first stage of my edifice the se- cond was formed by critical investigation of the line which ancient masters preferred in their best productions finally while was scrutinizing the utility of the oval and triangle which are proposed as the furest direction for designing human head the examination and comparison of the skulls and maxillæ which had been sawn through discovered to me new and more simple manner of portraying any form of head pleased either of men or of animals with much greater degree of precision as met with sew connoisseurs in painting and still fewer who enjoyed speculations of this kind my pursuits were totally neglected until the year when being in company with my much esteemed friend mr. van hemsterhuys at the house of his excellency the count of bentinck lord of rhoon we examined together number of beautiful in- ately the originals from the counterfeits the grecian from the ciples of my knowledge which explained with the addi¬ tion of the leading observations had formerly made the count who was distinguishied judge and sound critic in every branch of the polite arts was struck with the simplicity of my discoveries and urged me with his usual politeness to arrange and more fully explain my ideas as they appeared of utility upon retiring to my country residence in order to enjoy relaxation from my academical labours undertook this ar- duous task but numberless difficulties presented themselves it was not only necessary to make drawings of the different bones of the face but to do this with accuracy this was finally furmounted the drawings were to be reduced to the same scale and properly arranged the best antiques and also the prints taken from them were to be examined and studied ancient and modern writers on the natural history of man and on the principles of drawing were to be perused with attention digested the work swelling under my hands not only became more extensive but promised to be more extensively useful flattered myself that it would prove acceptable not only to those who admire the masterly performances of ancient artists but also to those who are engaged in the study of na- ural history and to all young pupils in the arts of drawing and of sculpture employing every hour of leisure from other occupations finished the sketch of the present treatise towards the end of august in the year with my discoveries as is generally the case communicated them to several admirers of the fine arts they imagined that considerable service might be rendered to the science of painting and particularly to the academy of drawing establissied at amsterdam were to deliver some public lectures upon the subject before the members of that society these delivered on the first and second days of august in the year before numerous and respectable audience the president and chief patron of the institution burgo-master huygens and the other directors were pleased to exprefs their approbation of my endeavours by presenting me with golden medal « not less than sixteen years elapsed before convenient opportunity of publishing this treatise presented itself vari- ous engagements prevented me from revising it with atten- tion in order to enlarge or abridge as might be judged ne- cessary the difficulty had to find out an intelligent and skilful engraver was another obstacle at length the cele- brated mr. vinkeles was prevailed upon to engrave the sketches but the various occupations of this distinguished artist were the causes of further procrastination at length it appears accompanied with the wishies of its author that it may meet with indulgence and give satisfaction the medal was presented after the author had delivered some other lectures which completed his plan they treated of the subjects contained in the second book of this work it was the usual medal of the academy on the reverse of which vas the following inscription in the dutch language —ee presented to the learned ee peter camper by the directors of this academy as grateful acknowledg- eement for the useful lectures delivered before the general assembly in the years ee and part the first chapter concerning the characteristic difference of features in the most distinguished people on the globe when we observe concourse of people assembled to- gether in large commercial city from the different quarters of the globe we are able to distinguissi by à single glance of the eye not merely negroes from white men -- but among the latter we discriminate jews from christians spa¬ niards from frenchmen or germans and thefe from the english it is also possible to distinguish natives of the south- ern parts of france from those of the more northern unless they have been blended by intermarriages the scots are also known from the english and both from the lrishi in the cities of holland national physiognomy is lost but islanders retain the original features the inhabitants of hindelopen molkwerum and koudum have still the small those also of the face and long chin of their ancestors bildt are eafily distinguishable from their nearest continental neighbours by their short and compressed features each country therefore has some peculiarity which is per- petuated until the accidental blending of different people renders their distinguishing marks dubious or entirely oblite- rates them wars colonizations commerce navigation and shipwrecks have so completely intermixed the inhabitants of the most distant countries that characteristic distinctions are only to be found among those of central provinces that are remote from the access of strangers in countries that lie contiguous to each other and in islands adjacent to conti- nents the change is gradual and scarcely to be perceived but by comparing the different extremes people are distinguissied according to the grand division of continents into europeans africans asiatics and americans the inhabitants of these principal parts of the earth includ- ing the islanders of the south seas inhabitants of new hol- land and new zealand have never been discriminated from each other by permanent characteristics or personal indica- tions alonc some attribute peculiar to the quarter of the world or the specification of some singular ornament pecu- these are inhabitants of different districts in friezland on the borders of the zuyder sea they are remarkable for retaining the original simplicity of manners singularity of dress and rejecting matrimonial connections with any of their neigh- bours liarity of dress or custom have always been added thus an asiatic is distinguished from an european by colour and dress the african and american being somewhat similar in colour and dress are known by the addition of crocodile an elephant cargo of tobacco incision of the skin tatow- ing plumes of feathers it is however fact that the inhabitants of northern europe the laplanders for example are of more tawny complexion than those of java nor are many of the persians or the subjects of the mogul empire of darker complexion than the spanissi even the caffres although they are in- habitants of africa are remarkably different from the ango- lese and the nubians some of the american tribes seem to derive their origin rom the northern countries of asia the similarity of their make mode of living manners religion render this con- the many journies also taken ecture extremely probable from russia through siberia kamtschatka st. andries to america and more particularly the celebrated voyage of the late capt cook afford additional proofs of the fact the possibility of making the passage will be obvious to every one who consults the excellent chart publissied by that unfortunate circumnavigator in his last works and he will be convinced that it was not difficult for the laplanders sa- moiedes siberians kamtschatkans and the savage nations of asia to find their way to america through the same passage no man who contemplates the whole human race as it is now spread over the face of the earth without predilection gle pair that were formed by the immediate hand of god long after the world itself had been created and had passed through numberless changes from this pair all the habitable parts of the earth were gradually propagated the difference varies while the contexture of the skin is uniformly similar in all men have demonstrated upon former occasion that it is immaterial whether the colour of our first parents was black or fair since change from white to black is equally great as the reverse have in my collection of natural curiosities several speci- mens of the skins of moors italians and of the fairest dutch women in which the membrana reticularis is to greater or less degree of dusky hue so that no essential difference exists whichever of the propositions be advanced it sometimes happens that this reticular membrane becomes as black in our fairest women during their pregnancy as that of the blackest negro or angolese of this curious instance pre- sented itself in the year the abdomen and breasts of woman naturally of fair complexion had totally changed in treatise on the colour of negroes their colour the celebrated le cat has also mentioned se- veral instances of similar kind darkness of complexion begins also to diminisn in process of time of which have preserved various specimens in the skins of moors thus it is evident that the fairest skin may become black and the darkest become fair without our being able to afcer- tain the immediate cause the influence of the sun is uni- versally acknowledged but the above-mentioned changes in regnant women to which might be added instances of white negroes and of those who are rendered pale through various indispositions manifest that other causes operate upon this membrane as well as the sun ’ rays and wliy not does not

parts of the body acquire such sur- face that they do not reflect the rays of light that is they appear dark every tyro in philosophy knows that objects have no colour in themselves and that the idea of colour is excited in us according to the manner in which the rays of light are refracted since we are totally ignorant at what period after the formation of the globe man was created and the human race began to spread over the earth we shall confine ourselves to the differences in the human species that now exist the traité de la couleur de la peau humaine edit amsterd art iv buffon has anticipated and exhausted this subject in his excellent dissertation ee on man and the varieties in the « human species æ shall merely select the peculiarities that refer more immediately to our purpose and take the calmucks as specimen the calmucks compared with ourselves and more par- ticularly with the most celebrated figures of antiquity are deemed the ugliest of all the inhabitants of the earth their faces are flat and very broad from one cheek-bone to the other the nose is so flat that the sight penetrates into the nostrils the eyes are near to each other the lips are thick and the uppermost lip is long they resemble the inhabit- ants of siam as described by loubiere whose faces are broad acrofs the checks while their foreheads and chins terminate in point so that their form is more rhomboidal than oval compare plate fig with plate iii fig which repre- sent the profile and front face of calmuck according to buffon the face of the chinese is broad and round they have small eyes and large eye-brows the only chinese have ever seen was at london in the year the smallness of the nose did not strike me upon examining the cranium of chinese in my possession ob- serve that the cavities or sockets of the eyes are situated near together but that they are placed obliquely nor are they high in the forehead the os jugale or cheek-bone is not see nat hist part iii pag but prominent the superior maxilla from the bot- tom of the nose to the teeth is narrow as in the otaheites and contrary to that of the calmuck consequently they can not have broad upper lip the greatest singularity that strikes me equally in cele- bese chinese and an otaheite consists in the rectangular form of the inferior maxilla see plate fig have also remarked the same in all the women born in asia of dutch or english parents this renders the lower part of the face much broader than it is in other nations the whole form of the cranium of an otaheite and chinese is so very similar that might venture to conclude that the inhabitants of otaheite and the friendly isles were colony from china notwithstanding the greatness of the distance on examining the cranium of moluccan that is in my possession observe that the angle of the lower jaw is not so large but that the upper jaw projects more as in the negro and the calmuck readily agree with buffon that the inhabitants of the northern parts of the mogul empire and of persia the arme- nians the turks georgians mingrelians circassians and the inhabitants of europe in general are not only the fairest but have however seen many armenians whose countenances were not pleasing the natives of the more southern parts of france particularly the females still retain the semicircular form of the upper maxilla and that smoothness of countenance which is so striking in the pythian apollo and the grecian venus most of the northern french have very small heads ind sharp faces like the scots and many among us that is the os jugale recedes and does not spread as in the cal- muck compare plate ii fig with plate fig difference is not easily discerned by one that is not ac- customed to modelling but there is no nation so distinguishable as the jews men women and children from their births bear the character- istic marks of their race mr. west the distinguished painter vith whom have frequently conversed upon the subject confessing my inability to discover in what this national nose acknowledge that this contributes much and that it gives them resemblance to the lafcars of whom have seen numbers in london and have even taken the model of face in paris-plaster but there is still somewhat un- explained it is upon this account that the famous de wit has so ill succeeded in the council-chamber at the stadt-house of amsterdam he has exhibited in his paintings several men with beards but they are not israelites it would be impracticable to delineate all the characteris- tic varieties that exist in nature to avoid an expensive multitude of plates ishall consider the calmuck as the repre- sentative of all asia from siberia to new zealand and also of north america as it is more than probable that this people are descended from the northern asiatics we can determine nothing concerning the mexicans or patagonians as they are not aborigines and are most probably descended from europeans the head of an european shall be considered as specimen of all europe turkey persia and the largest part of arabia as far as indostan the head of an angolese negro shall be substituted for all africa also for the hottentots who do not materially differ from the negroes for the caffres and for the natives of madagascar the moluccans seem to have blended to- gether the characteristics of the asiatic and the african have prefixed the cranium of the simia caudata or tailed ape and of small orang-outang in order to demon- strate the importance of the facial line which is applicable to all animals chapter the opinions of ancient and modern writers concerning the different shapes of the human head stated andrefuted herodotus hippocrates suidas aristotle pliny mela and many other writers of antiquity have uniformly maintained that the variety of forms observable nd other natural causes but also from some original artifice which finally gives birth to determined form this opinion has been adopted by some of the most eminent writers among the moderns as cardan vesalius schenck and more recently haller and the count de buffon and it seenis to be confirmed by the remarks of numberless travellers have controverted the sentiment upon former occasion ’ the whole of the present treatise will manifest its absurdity did not venture to oppose an opinion uniformly supported by such respectable authorities until about thirty years ago the fotus of female negro came into my possession in this faetus which was of about six months all the features were so strongly marked that every person could

thomas ’ hospital allowed me to take draught of the cranium of an aged man from st. vincent one of the carribean islands of which the whole forehead was flattened the crown peaked while the pa¬ rietal bones remained convex which gave very oblong form to the head hunauld has described and delineated one of the same kind and winssow mentions another instance of similar nature on my visit to oxford in the same year made drawing of the cranium of young man that was brought from nootka sound by captain king which was also compressed into nearly the same form this is deposited in the collection belonging to the anatomical theatre of christ ’ college if this be à national custom it is à subject of wonder how so strange practice could have been introduced into three countries so very remote from each other and it is still mr. forster has observed that the inhabitants of malicolo have the forehead very much slattened without deciding whether this proceeded from art or was na- tural.— see observ faites pendant le voyage de mons cook paris tom viii greater wonder that it does not prove injurious to their mental faculties it is most probable that these were singular instances for captain cook speaking of the inhabitants of nootka sound in his last voyage simply observes that they have the forehead rather low without making any other remarks mr. hughes also who describes the inhabitants of mention of such custom and extols the vivacity of the carribees but to return to the antients hippocrates seems disposed to attribute the particular form of the head to the conduct of midwives and nurses he observes that many persons considering the oblong form of the head as the most graceful press them flat during infancy and that they thus acquired naturally the particular shape which nations considered as the most pleasing vesalius supports this idea and also asserts that some mid- wives have been bribed by mothers to shape the heads of their children into the form of ball he conjectures that the flatness and breadth of the occiput in the germans proceeds from the manner in which infants are bound in portable cradle which the mothers carry on their backs when they travel and that the more oblong form observable in the heads of dutch children arises from their being perpetually placed on the side in the cradle neither of these eminent men has vol ii chap pages and de aere locis into consideration the natural form of the pelvis which in this country particularly is frequently so narrow that the head of the infant can not pafs until the throes of the mother have moulded it into an oblong form by which the diameter is lessened it is therefore not surprizing that the learned should have acknowledged the influence of art or that scaliger ’ should have confidently asserted that the genoese having derived the custom from their ancestors the moors should press the heads of their sleeping children until art became nature and the whole race was born with heads and minds of thersites car- danus expressly says that among the provincials of portus vetus in the west indies the people have no necks but heads of quadrangular shape that this originated from art it having been customary to compress the head between planks but that nature finally succeeded to art count de buffonj relates from raleigh that there are nations in guiana whose necks are so extremely short and shoulders so elevated that their eyes seem to be placed upon their shoulders and their mouths upon their breasts the count properly compares these to the scythians and to the acephali of the antients it is very probable that the anti- ents considered apes and the orang-outang as belonging to the human race and also the modern travellers seeing them at distance have mistaken them for men pliny when he treats of athiopia ’ observes that the blemmyi have no heads —that their eyes and mouths are placed upon their breasts and that some who are destitute of heads have their eyes placed upon their shoulders he also ad- vances upon the authority of eudoxus that in some parts of india the men have feet an ell long while those of the women are so small that they have the name of struthopodes sparrowfeet and also that the ears of some are so long and broad that they can hide themselves behind them straboj relates upon the testimony of onesicritus that the ears of some men in india hung down to their heels so that they could snugly sleep upon them however he allows the accouut to be fabulous pomp mela asserts with confidence that the otomegalos had such large ears that they could en- tirely envelop themselves in them solinus says that there are men in india meaning thie panotes who cover themselves with their own ears in the voyages of captain cook « mention is made of the inhabitants of easter islands whose ears are slit through the middle and hang down almost to their shoulders count de buffon enlarges very judicioussy upon the causes of the national differences that take place in different people he reduces these to three — ist the influence of climate of food of manners and customs respecting the first cause that the colour depends upon it does not admit of doubt and yet it is fact that in the coldest climates such as greenland and kamtschatka the natives are nearly as black as in madagascar however the hottest climates yield men of the deepest jet unless they intermix with the inhabitants of other nations the peculiar forms of the eyes cheeks maxillary bones and particularly of the nose may safely be attributed to the influence of climate as we are upon the subject it will not be improper to ob¬ serve that no great dependence can be placed upon the portraits of different nations given in the voyages of captain cook the painter mr webber has in most of them indi¬ cated too much of the mannerist for example in the women of otaheite represented in the and zyth plates however he appears to have been more exact in delineating the upper eye-lids in the women of new holland and diemen ’ land in plates the and the women of oonalaska have the same physiognomy and the same small eye-lids as those of kamtschatka mr. west informs me that ahis is peculiarity observable also in the english thaf are born in north america the object of the painter seems to have been to represent the heads and countenances of well-proportioned men and pleasing women this is remarkably the case in the young females of otaheite particularly in the and z plates to whom he has given the features of frenchwomen on the other hand those animals which have nothing pleasing in their figures are always reprefented as monsters as will appear from the plate the influence of food may be learned from our own animals the horse cow and sheep although there is no great diversity of climate in the different provinces of holland rich or meagre pasturage changes the form the horns and the wool of animals under the article of nutrition comprehend fluids and peculiarities of atmosphere as well as food but how these operate and why the upper maxilla of negro and the cheek- bone of calmuck projects and why the socket of the eye is lower and more oblique in chinese and moluccan can not be fully explained to observe and point out parti- climate frequently co-operate but we can not suppose them productive of different race black tawny and white men are simply varieties they do not constitute essential differences our skin is precisely of the same contexture with that of the negro but it is not of so deep dye it is probable that the hair becomes long and straight or curled or frizzled according to the nature of the food chiefly it is remarkable that the natives of drent and of the bishiopric of munster have naturally sleek hair but after they bave resided some years in amsterdam it begins to curl of this we have many instances manners and customs indubitably operate with great force upon the form and posture of the body polished educa- tion renders the whole figure elegant of this we have daily instances in polissied nations particular manner of sitting of lying of standing and walking various corporeal defects and other circumstances of the like nature give particular cast to the whole body this is so obviously the case that the countenance of de- formed person will become deformed that is it sinks gradually by the pressure of the brain which has now lost its equipoise thus the socket of the one eye sinks lower than that of the other of this have very remarkable instance in my abinet in person that is lame the whole knee turns in- wards by the twist given to the femoral bone in those who are formed awry or are very round-shouldered the clavicle is straighter and longer shall not mention the pernicious effect of stays with which so many of our females spoil the shapes of their children without being admonissied by their wn we ridicule the chinese for maiming the feet of their females in so forcible manner and yet we are guilty of simi¬ lar folly as have demonstrated upon another occasion ’ nay in treatise concerning the best form of shoe we exceed them for we not only incapacitate the female sex from walking but we disable ourselves the fillets that bind up the hair of our ordinary women leaves an impression in their heads garters make deep furrow under the knee as effectually with us as with the inhabitants of brasil who consider it as an ornament education employments and suitable mode of living add beauty both to the features and to the limbs they render the whole body more elegant such is the difference between persons genteelly educated and those who have been totally neglected that it is scarcely credible that manners and habits should be able to effectuate such changes in the same being various endemic diseases are not less influential the rachites or rickets may occasion numberless deformities of body by the way it appears from the writings of hippo- rates that the inhabitants of the most salubrious climate in he universe were subject to this disease as well as those of the more northern or southern regions otherwise he would not have been able to describe the diseases which are derived from this source in so masterly manner in proportion as the indispositions arising from deformity are subjects for commiseration ought the cruel and inhuman taste of the contemporaries of longinus to be held in contempt he tells us ’ that they took pleasure in keeping dwarfs locked longinus de sublimitate xiii page in confined chests and in swathing them with bandages on purpose to give them some ludicrous deformity this conduct appeared to him so cruel that he inclined to doubt the fact but we learn from suetonius that such deformed persons were kept in all the houses of the great tiberius prohibited these ludibria naturæ but alexander severus on the contrary amused the populace with them in russia they are still exhibited in the palaces of the nobility physiological observations concerning the difference of faces in profile from apes ourangs negroes and other classes of people up to the antique the assemblage of craniums and profiles of two apes negro and calmuck in the first plate may perhaps excite surprise the striking resemblance between the race of monkies and of blacks particularly upon superficial view has induced some philosophers to conjecture that the race of blacks originated from the commerce of the whites with ourangs and pongos or that these monsters by gradual im- provements finally become men this is not the place to attempt full confutation of so extravagant notion must refer the reader to physiological dissertation concerning the ourang-outang publishied in the year shall simply observe at present that the vhole generation of apes from the largest to the smallest re quadrupeds not formed to walk erect and that from the very construction of the larynx they are incapable of speech further they have great similarity with the canine species particulary respecting the organs of generation the diversities observable in these parts seem to mark the boundaries which the creator has placed between the various classes of animals the proximity of the eyes to each other the smallness and apparent flatness of the nose and the projection of the upper lip constitute the principal points of resemblance and these are much exaggerated by our modern naturalists by their heightened descriptions and embellished plates but they will immediately diminish in our estimation if we give attention to the whole body or minutely examine every part of the head this will evidently appear by comparing together the different figures of the first plate all the figures in the first second and fourth plates are sketched in profilex in this manner the differences may basis of the features which are immediately placed upon and under them in each of these figures the greatest accuracy and preci- sion have been diligently studied for example an hori- zontal line has been drawn through the lower part of the nose see plate and the orifice of the ear and the four skulls were arranged with care on the line atten- tion being also paid to the direction of the jugale or cheek- bone fig and order to preserve the true form and relative situations of the parts did not view them from one fixed point but

pegs correspondent to the holes made in the upper part of the frame that lines may also be drawn by means of threads obliquely downwards thus may the true point of vision be obtained by placing the eye in such direction that the oblique thread may perfectly coincide with the perpendicular one the table before me being elevated to such height that my eye became parallel with the horizontal line

semble some species of monkies this will be fully explained hereafter. to proceed with as much perspicuity as possible shall place the facial line mg. erect in the perpendicular line hi see plate ii

the same plate on the other hand the distance between tx that is between the facial line and the perpendicular line that passes from the vertex by the orifice of the ear gains as much as xu has lost the head becomes gradually narrower also in proportion as the facial line rises and inclines forwards into the tooth degree which is the maximum or utmost that the artificial line will permit in this case the eyes placed in the centre of their cavities are exactly in the middle of the head or at an equal distance from the vertex and the bottom of the chin see figure of the same plate if the projecting part of the forehead be made to exceed the degree the head becomes mishapen and assumes the appearance of the hydrocephalus or watery head it is very surprising that the artists of ancient greece should have chosen precisely the maximum while the best roman artists have limited themselves to the degree which is not so pleasing as the comparison of the and ath figures of this plate will evince the two extremities therefore of the facial line are from degrees from the negro to the grecian antique make it under and you describe an ourang or an ape lessen it still more and you have the head of dog in- crease the minimum and you form fowl fnipe for ex- ample the facial line of which is nearly parallel with the horizon that is both the maxillæ will be lengthened and the lower maxilla will gradually lose its angle cv no pace is now left for teeth which explains the reason why fowls are destitute of teeth have sometimes amused myself with making these gra¬ dations upon smaller scale by sketching them on long it is slip of paper which exhibits singular appearance not necessary to give specimen as they can be easily made by every one skilled in drawing if attention be given to the angle mg which describes the angle formed by the facial line and the lower extremity of the chin see the four figures of the first plate it will be im- mediately perceived that this becomes larger more rect- angular in proportion as the facial line ascends it is therefore the largest in european as in fig plate ii gi and that it projects forwards with the facial line which it always follows as in fig of plate ii in this situation the angle of the lower jaw becomes more erect the distance from to becomes less and is rounder it is this which makes the maxilla of the antique heads rounder and more graceful as will appear in the ath fig of the second plate the eyes which are placed nearly in line with the upper edge of their sockets gradually recede in an european and the antique that is or the distance from the eye to the ridge of the nofe gradually becomes greater see the and ath lower fig of plate ii this gives certain elegance and dignity to the countenance of the antique which can not be otherwise acquired it is plain if the cavity of the eye remains at the same distance from the perpendicular line and the forehead be made to project forwards that this depth or distance will increase according to the degree of projection see the same plate and figures if am not deceived the size of the mouth is in propor- tion to the distance of the dentes canini or eye-teeth in men and animals with only few exceptions or to speak more properly the angles terminate at the commencement of the first double tooth or grinder many animals have not the eye-teeth in apes therefore in the orang and in the negro the rim or angle of the mouth must be more distended than in an european as the projection of the upper jaw enlarges the dis- tance for the same reason the mouth of the antique will be the smallest the central line of the ear is in all persons somewhat inclined as have represented it in figures and of the sixth plate it is never parallel with the facial line in white men it is however in the negro as is apparent from the third figure of the first plate have placed the central line of the ear perpendicularly in the second plate that the true distance of the eye from the ear may be more accurately ascertained chapter iv remarks concerning differences in the facial line and the changes which necessarily arise from thence in the preceding chapter have simply shewn the kind of angle which the oblique line mg. makes in all the figures of the first and second plate let us now pay attention to the triangle of plate fig and and it will appear that this triangle is not remarkably large in the european represented in plate ii fig in the second figure of this second plate it is totally effaced in the third the angle be- comes minus and in the fourth the minus is increased let us now suppose that all these heads were of an equal size and that the nose of each projected to an equal distance from the line or surface plate fig and it is manifest that the nose of the negro and calmuck will seem to be less and as it were pressed inwards the nose of the european plate ii fig will appear somewhat bent and also to project farther than the upper lip in the face of the antique fig the nose will be nearly in perpendicular line with the forehead and project but little from the lip the lower jaw as well as the upper is also much for- warder in the negro caffre and calmuck and therefore it is that these people approach nearer to the figure of an ape than either the european or the antique the lines mgs are nearly the same with the lines mg compare the lower sketches with the upper in plate fig and in calmuck the upper jaw is very flat before because the cheek-bone plate fig being very large nearly advances to the perpendicular line tt that is directly over the middle molaris or grinder in the chinese otaheites and other orientals the cheek-bone corresponds with the di- vision between the third and fourth grinder hindwards in the negro is obviously shorter and the line falls behind the third grinder in the european is behind the fourth grinder and in the antique head it comes yet more for- wards hence it follows that the features of antiques those of apollo for example must be flatter than ours and on the other hand those of asiatics and africans still flatter and those of the calmucks the flattest of all the distance from ntog from the undermost part of the nose to the union of the upper and lower teeth is greater in calmuck than in negro and in him greater than in us on the contrary ng is very short in an asiatic the lips must necessarily be longer and thicker in proportion to this distance and therefore is the upper lip the longest and thickest in calmuck and the smallest in the antique if attention be paid to what may be called the suspension of the face the distance of pf fig and plate the axis upon which the head moves from the line of the lower maxilla il in negro or calmuck plate fig and or the european plate ii fig it will appear that the maxilla and the chin are deeper or lower in the two former than in the latter the condyle also or prominence on which the head turns is in the same line as the union of the teeth of the upper and lower jaw see plate fig hence it follows that the neck of calmuck is shorter than that of an european or rather that it appears to be shorter because the lower jaw or chin sinks so much lower in proportion as the chin is lower the condyle of the neck shorter and the shoulders raised in consequence of the length of the cla- vicle as is the case with the orang and with all deformed per- sons will the head sink more upon the breast and the stronger will be the resemblance to the people who are denominated acephali and who are said to exist in guinea again as the foramen magnum of the occiput is not always placed at an equal distance from the perpendicular line and as the condyles are placed in an oblique direction before and on each side of the foramen it follows that the centre of motion of the head will vary considerably in different peo¬ ple the line extended from the extreme point of the mouth to that of the occiput may be compared to lever of which the centre of motion is in now in proportion as the distance from ntoc is increased will the face project for- wards and the neck will appear shorter the following appear to be the different proportions in the calmuck is nc or the distance from the extremity of the teeth to the orifice of the ear compared with cd or the distance from this orifice to the extreme part of the oc- ciput as to or nearly as to the negro is nc cd the european is nc cd in the antique is nc cd heads of the calmucks must of consequence incline forwards and sink upon the shoulders the heads of negroes incline backwards as the heaviest part is behind the centre of motion the head of the orang -outang must be more for- wards than that of the calmuck for the reasons given and the head of the ape the dog horse still more than either of these the heads of the europeans remain in an equipoise which gives them something of an haughty mien in the antiques the gentle inclination of the head par- ticularly in the statues communicates the most state and dig- nity to the countenance since began to compose this treatise have been able to procure the entire cranium of chinese who died in the flower of his age the facial line was degrees the cavities of the eyes were in breadth compared with their height as to in the european they are equal it is not surprising therefore that the countenance of the chinese should have à melancholy aspect and that the chinks or fissures formed by the upper and lower eye-lids are naturally so long their superior maxilla is narrow that is the space from to is very small so that they can not have large lip however the lower jaw is of more quadrangular form than in the european or the negro in the chinese it makes an angle of degrees in the european of and in the negro see svw in plate ii fig and plate fig the lower jaw of the chinese has upon this ac- count something of the ape and particularly of the orang in its form took fketch of the entire cranium of an otaheite who was

great resem- blance with that of the chinese the facial line was how- ever perpendicular which may have been incidental in the cranium of an islander of the celebese are the same pe- culiarities as in that of the chinese in the cranium of man of the celebese and one of macassaar which possess there is complete similarity more than with that of moguller which has notwith- standing much of the asiatic in its form it is amusing to contemplate an arrangement of these placed in regular succession apes orangs negroes the skull of an hottentot madagascar celebese chinese moguller calmuck and divers europeans it was in this manner that arranged them upon shelf in my cabinet in order that those differences might become the more obvious which have described in the preceding chapter to perceive at once the great utility of these principles let any person sketch the profile of negro as in plate vl fig the one delineated in the third figure of the first late the outlines of which are marked in the sixth plate by the letters then draw the facial line of an european along the forehead fe of degrees which will direct him to sketch from to ne and and to terminate in and he will immediately have the face of an european or let the face of an european be first sketched and by inverting the mode the physiognomy of negro will be obtained by covering the dotted line bh with the tips of the fingers the european face becomes more conspicuous on the contrary by covering neo the negro will more perfectly appear chap phiysiological examination of the difference in the features when viewed in front the third plate exhibits at first glance the principal differences between the negro calmuck and european as copied from nature and also the head of pythian apollo drawn according to the principles advanced and which will be more fully considered hereafter the orang-outang that was represented in profile in the second figure of the first plate is now placed in front that the breadth of the jugal or cheek-bones mn may be more accurately compared with the breadth of the head at po and that the small space between the eyes may be com- pared with that in the calmuck in the orang the length of the head ih compared with ts greatest breadth at po is in the proportion of to and po compared with the breadth of the cheek-bones mn as to that is equal mn compared with the breadth of the temporal bones xw is as to reader will perceive that all the correspondent parts are placed upon the horizontal line and that the height of each is also adapted to the scale of its profile let us now examine the negro plate iii fig this head in length compared with its breadth is as to is but mn xw the lower jaw uv is as does the whole face gradually diminish from in the direction of mv to and onu retaining much of the oval form the apertures of the nose are very wide com- pared with the length of the nose so that ef is to dc as to it necessarily follows that the pinnæ which are formed to cover these apertures will be expanded on each side and the nose will be very broad the distance of the cavities of the eye yz is as so that the eyes exceed in nearness to each other the breadth of the nose and the pinnæ which are placed at the side of ef will be at least as in breadth in this negro the diameter of the eye-socket from the fore- head downwards was very large that is kl was equal to so that the eye might have been large in others have found the cavities smaller as also in the chinese there is also great difference among europeans in this respect when drew lines from the upper edge of the small nasal- bones at over the broadest parts of the nose at down to qand the four dentes incisorii and the two dentes canini or eye-teeth were inclosed between them now as the mouth always covers the eye-teeth qr will necessarily limit the breadth of the mouth in proportion as the distance froin qto is great compared with the breadth of the maxilla at vu will the mouth appear ugly and dispropor¬ tioned qr is nearly as and vu a have small ears but as the mammillary processes are the breadth of the cheek-bones mn they stand off from the head this is observable in all negroes the calmuck is very differently formed plate iii fig the proportions are as follow the height of the head ih compared with its breadth at is as to or to compared with mn the projection of the jugal-bones is as to compared with the temples is as to the lower jaw is as or face has also something of lozenge or rhomboidal form it is narrow and pointed towards the crown becomes broad at op is the broadest at nm and becomes suddenly small at uv this has been already remarked by la lou- biere the apertures of the nose ef are as so that the pinnae can not be very broad but the openings in the nostrils are very conspicuous as will be obvious by comparing the cranium with the face in plate fig distance of the eye-sockets yz is very small so that the eyes stand much closer together than in the negro the diameter of these cavities at compared with ih lie upon the jugal-bone the fissure must be oblong at least must appear so as the pleats or wrinkles in the smaller can- thus or angle seem to lengthen it in the chinese the eye- sockets are broader than they are high hence they have long eyes the triangle cqr drawn in the same manner as in the negro describes qr that is includes the four dentes incisorii and the half of the eye-teeth the other portions being added the mouth will become and seven-eighths or nearly the cheek-bones are remarkably broader than the head that is mn op the ears are almost hid behind them as in apes and particularly in that de- scribed in fig of this plate which has also à striking re- semblance to the calmiuck in the narrow space between the eyes breadth of the jaw-bones and flatness of the face very different from those in the calmuck are the proportions observable in modern europeans particularly in our own countrymen for ih po wx faces therefore have the form of an oval which is shorter in proportion to its breadth than that of the negro the distance between the edges of the eye-sockets yz being equal to the breadth of the nasal apertures our eyes are placed at greater distance from each other and as the diameter of these sockets kl are there is space for large eyes but the pinnae of the nose are broader than the space between the eyes the ears are closer to the head in consequence of op the parietal-bones being so much broader than the jugal-bones mn this will be clearly understood from what has been advanced concerning the negro and calmuck the triangle cor being longer and the distance from the upper part of the nasal-bone to the junction of the teeth at being greater thus is the mouth qr obviously smaller ef in the european being equal to ef in the negro that is the mouth qr moreover is to uv equal to compared with antiques the facial line mg. being made to project see plate ii fig jthe crown becomes more elevated and rises from to which is equal to the degree of projection at mh hence it is that in the fifth figure of this third plate the head of the antique is made so high although it is formed after the same model artists have also made mn the jugal-bones equal to po the parietal-bones in breadth the occiput is narrower the maxillæ smaller and the eyes are placed at greater distance from each other in the antique the following proportions are observed ihpo wx vu the face is in the form of more oblong oval the antients divided po into four equal parts one for each eye and one for the distance between the eyes poas ayz whereas it was only in the modern head the nose also inclining forwards as represented in the lower sketch plate ii fig it is proportionably longer see th and the upper lip becomes proportionably shorter the nasal apertures remaining of the same width as in us the pinnæ are equal to yz or the space between the eyes and also to the size of the mouth qr through the projection of the facial line the eyes are deeper seated and the middle line which runs acrofs the angles of the eyes divides ih into two equal parts at but this takes place alone when mg. the facial line makes an angle of to degrees with which is the maximum of its inclination see plate ii fig vi diversity of features in the countenances of different people naturally explained have already enumerated in the second chapter all the causes alledged by ancient and modern writers of the diversities of make observable in the human counte- nance and we have added our opinion to that of the acute naturalist count de buffon that the climate under which we include the influence of air of food and customs is of itself sufficient to give some particular and appropriated form to the bones and consequently to the softer parts when we add the different diseases peculiar to some countries which co- operate with the above causes we shall not be surprised that similar diversity should be found in the human species dis- persed over different parts of the globe as may be observed in plants fowls quadrupeds it has we hope been fully demonstrated that in the negro the upper maxilla naturally projects remarkably for- wards and that in consequence of that formation the line mg. inclining backwards makes an angle of degrees as represented in plate fig and hence it necessarily follows that the fore-teeth must also project and that to cover these the lips particularly the upper lip must be long thick and broad and the under lip must also be conformable to the other the nose advancing farther than the line ts in similar proportion see plate fig must appear from the jutting out of the upper lip to be pressed inwards no art is required to produce this appearance nor was it requisite for mothers or midwives-to squeeze in the one or stretch out the other the width of the nasal aperture in the cranium requires the nose to be broad and that the pinna which are placed xternally should be proportionate to the apertures in the bony parts why have not philosophers and travellers who suffer themselves to be deceived by idle tales informed us that the negroes made the sides of their nose spread by means of some compress their accidentally striking them against the backs of their mothers might perhaps flatten the carti- laginous part but could not enlarge the nostrils on each side with such perfect symmetry the flatness of the face depends upon the extention of the jugal-bone from toq plate and ii hence it is clear to à demonstration that the faces of the easterns were not rendered flat by artificial compression but that they are so from natural causes at least they appear flat when compared with our ovn it has also been shewn that in the negro the back part of the head is heavier than the fore part that is cde is heavier than plate fig the negro therefore naturally throws his head backwards particularly young persons while the neck is protruded forwards and the loins bent inwards in order to maintain an equilibrium it is from this cause that they have small hips and that the pelvis is generally narrow its breadth compared with its depth is in the proportion of to while in most other men who are well formed it is as to as the negroes with whom we are best acquainted have been slaves and been compelled to hard labour from their tender years their knees become bent in an inward or outward di- rection and hence it is that so many of them have crooked many other causes might be added upon which shall not enlarge as it is not my plan to give minute description of the whole body what has been advanced will sufficiently demonstrate that changing the colour or in crisping the hair and that to nature alone these differences must be ascribed for similar reasons is the face of calmuck chinese and siamese flat the nose small the nostrils open and exposed their lips will be larger or smaller according to the size of the upper maxilla let us admit for moment that the sides of their heads were pressed between planks according to the narratives of ancient authors whence is it that the jugal-bones spread out so mucht they also must have been compressed from vhat cause is the distance between their eyes so small lf this proceeded from their being pressed closer together the upper aw instead of being much broader than with other people must also have become flatter at the sides as cq is so long see plate fig and the back part of the head cde so small compared with its opposite etgsc the head must necessarily hang over and the subject become round shouldered that is directly opposite to the form of the negro the head will also sink between the shoulders as in the orang and other species of apes the head of the calmuck is decidedly greater than ours while their body is small besides they can not walk per- fectly upright and their knees are somewhat extended in the manner of our porters when they carry heavy load on their heads this must render their figure disagreeable in our eyes who are accustomed to see tall persons or times the length of their heads whereas this people the inhabitants of lap- land of brazil and some other countries are scarcely the length of six heads in their stature most of these people sit upon the ground without using chairs whence they naturally stoop more and not only appear shorter but according to our ideas more deformed in an european the inclination of the superior maxilla being the same with that of the facial line which forms an angle of degrees see plate ii fig the nose becomes larger should we not deem it very ridiculous if travelling or philosophic negro or calmuck in describing the particular forms of our features were gravely to asfert that our mid- wives mothers or nurses pulled us by the nose during our infant days in order to give it the requisite length it is observable that the inhabitants of these dutch pro- bones during infancy and childhood hence it is that our foreheads are frequently high flat and broad while the lower part of the face is small and delicate both the upper and lower maxilla are with us extremely small the hips are broad in both sexes which occasions waddling motion and renders our countrymen less agile than those who have smaller hips ancient artists followed in this respect the cha- racter of their statue in the farnese hercules the breadth compared with the depth is made as to in the pythian apollo it is as to in the antinous as the proportions of alb durer are as to in our females the proportion is as to the greeks have made it in the venus de medicis as to that is they have made the body smaller thicker and more rotund in word it would be absurd to acknowledge the influence of art in making the hair straight or curled the legs thick or thin the head large or small among us and surely it is equally absurd to ascribe the particulars in the form of other nations to the same cause lf any doubt should remain the following experiment will demonstrate the truth of my affertions sketch the figure of negro as in plate vi fig draw the parallel lines ac and bd and the vertical line .. from the extremity of the line de make the line ef forming the triangle fed of degrees delineate mouth at ea and it will im- mediately appear that the nofe of the negro has not been pressed inwards but that the maxilla projects too far by similar process may an european be transformed into negro and the figure will fully evince that the negroes no more compress the noses of their children to make them smaller and flatter than we lengthen the nofes of ours by perpetually pulling them part the second chapter concerning the form of childrens heads viewed in profile manner in which all the profiles in the first plate were taken has been already explained shall merely observe that the profiles in the fourth plate were drawn by means of the same instrument and with equal accuracy the great difference which exists between the head of an infant just born and of one that is year old has determined me to make choice of the first and second figures the third figure is delineated after the cranium of well- formed adult it is the same that was given in the first figure of the second plate the foürth is drawn from toothlefs old woman that the essential differences may become more conspicuous in the head of new-born child the skull ogup see plate iv fig may be considered as an oval placed hori- zontally to the fore and under part of which the maxilla are affixed this shape is not so uniform as to exclude all variations but these are not very great the lower part of the chin and forehead are placed parallel to the per- pendicular line in child one year old the forehead projects beyond the line ad and the back part of the head is much enlarged dovnwards the upper and lower maxilla are also enlarged qd was in the new-born infant equal to one-fourth but in thisit is much more see fig diameter of the eye-socket gh in the first figure is one-fifth compared with ad and something more in child of one year it is also as one-fifth in the head of an adult but this proceeds from the enlargement of the nose and of the maxilla these cavities are in reality much larger in the adult than in the child which manifests that certain ule is observed although they are much larger in children in proportion to the difference of age as infants are born without teeth the upper jaw qr is very narrow in the space of year it grows nearly as broad again in the adult the upper jaw is about three times as large and if we include the teeth it is four times but there are diversities in this respect according to the natural strength of the person or national peculiarities the upper jaw also gradually projects forwards and the dentes molares are completely formed at about the age of twenty years or the length of the lower part of the face is now to as or in child it is only one-fifth as in figure the first and three-tenths in figure the second the lower jaw undergoes à similar change tk is not only larger but the point of the angle shoots backwards so that it becomes nearly quadrangular with the condyle particularly in the chinese and other easterns the chin at the same time shoots forwards as will best it projects about one-twelfth before the facial line in whereas it was about equal with the perpendicular line in the nfant see fig of plate iv the upper and lower same time are regularly opposed to each other yet in the best formed heads the lower teeth are placed within the upper ones in children the small distance from qto that is of the maxilla and the nasal-bones from the jugal gives them flatnefs of countenance which is well observed by fla- mingo the antients always made the lower maxilla of children too long and therefore they did not succeed in the pleasing when they delineated children of tender age the nose may be distinguished into two parts the one which has its basis at and which forms the cavity under the forehead and the nose itself from to fig.- and just born have no cavity above the nose and the eye-sockets see and therefore they have flat fore- head that is the forehead projects farther than whereas in adult persons the part projects farther than and in aged persons still more as in figure the fourth it is for this reason that the nose of negro appears to sink so deep and also that it appears to have been much more com¬ pressed in an aged than in young negro the nose itself is small in children making about one-fifth of the line in adults it is one-fourth and broad in proportion the head of an infant is longer than it is high compare dc with df which is equal to ad in some this dif- ference is very great in figure the second dc is about one-fifth longer than df but this length seems peculiar to the children of thefe provinces as has been noticed by vesa- lius we have already observed that the occiput is smaller in antiques from the great projection of the facial line de wit however although he is justly celebrated for his paint- ing of children has not attended to this difference of these he has also shortened the occiput and raised the vertex the real form of the head has not escaped the notice of quefnoy as shall be fully exemplified when we explain the fourth figure of the fifth plate the centre of motion is not in the centre of the head but it is placed more forwards hence it is that the heads of our children can not maintain an equipoise are prone to incline forwards and yet more to fall backwards as soon as the line ad is exceeded the middle point is changed and this inclination of the head somewhat forwards gives it à certain grace alb durer has made the facial line of his children to in¬ cline forwards having placed it at degrees the same as in the third figure of our second plate quesnoy and de wit have mostly placed it at in this position the head must be raised until become equal to st. see plate fig meatus auditorius enlarges also very considerably as the infant advances as well as the mammillary procefs behind the ear see fig ii while the infant is very young it is seated about the condyle at and is scarcely visible but in adults the mammillary process is very much enlarged and it descends much lower as in the third and fourth sigures of this fourth plate this is much more obviously the case in men than in females in whom none of the processes are so strongly marked chap ii the form of the head in an adult person the form of the head in adult persons has already been fully explained in the third chapter of the first part of this treatise we shall only observe at present that the growth of the nasal-bone plate iv fig gradually commu- nicates pleasing form to the nose and in some persons ren- ders the whole countenance graceful negroes and asiatics are destitute of this grace and the greeks have omitted it indeed they were compelled to omit it for as they make the direction of the nose nearly perpendicular they could not give his elevation without producing degree of deformity the distance from the fore part of the nose to the jugal- bone hv being greater in us than in any other people the nose appears longer than it is in reality particularly in thin ersons and this prevents our countenances from having very flat appearance our nostrils are just visible as the bot- tom of the nose hi see the lower sketches of fig and is placed horizontally or parallel to the ground the projection of our teeth usually occasions projection of the lips and the chin seems to recede every other par- ticular may he collected from what has been already remarked and from contemplating the figures chap iii the form of the face in persons far advanced in years observation induces me to believe that in this country the women generally lose all their teeth earlier than the men but as the men lose them also the fourth figure of the fourth plate is equally applicable to both sexes aged persons not only lose their teeth but their gums that is the thick margin containing the alveolae or sockets in which the roots of the teeth are placed the roof of the mouth which was arched in younger years becomes entirely flat the lower maxilla also having lost both teeth and gums is no longer so broad from thefe causes is the space within the mouth so remarkably diminished that sufficient place is not left for the tongue as it can no longer be drawn up and adjusted to the arched roof of the mouth and not having its usual space through the failure of the teeth and gums it is apt to protrude out of the mouth upon the slightest attempts to move it forwards the tongue appears therefore to be longer than it was as it is in reality from its being forced out of curved line the nose having lost its support qr plate iv fig bends downwards and hangs over the mouth the fall under the forehead becomes deeper while the projecting part is fuller this renders the furrows or wrinkles deeper and more visible the whole of the upper maxilla becomes more concave and the fore part qr which in younger years rojected outwards now contracts inwardly so that the upper lip falls within the margin of the mouth and the nose appears much larger than it did in more youthful days the lower jaw which had in its external circuit the form described by tkd of the third figure is now by the lofs of the teeth with their alveolae drawn upwards through the action of the muscles until the gums nearly meet the tip of the chin now shoots beyond the line qd tox com- pare figure the third with figure the fourth of this fourth late the distance of the chin from the nose is shorter by one- sixth part of the length of the head the nose and chin seem almost to touch each other this circumstance is totally ne- glected by rubens de wit ’ and other celebrated painters blomaart aims at following nature but he has not just ideas of her operations lairesse testa and the immortal raphael have followed her with the greatest attention greuze the famous french artist seems to have totally dis- regarded the peculiarity this is obvious from the plate which has in other respects very great merit when the lower jaw rises to one-sixth as we have already observed the angle of the mouth is drawn downwards the « see his book of drawings plate xi fig cords the wrinkles of the face always manifest themselves in direction contrary to that of the muscular fibres hence they are transverse on the forehead are radiated round the eyes and mouth and run acrofs the neck parallel to the course of the lower jaw xkt by comparing the cranium with the face plate iv fig it will be obvious that the distin- guishing marks of age are placed in the bony parts and not in the wrinkles to be convinced of the importance of these remarks let the reader delineate head according to the first figure of the second plate forming the profile together with the ear as represented in the second figure of the sixth plate let the projection form the cavity above the nose by omitting the teeth the mouth de will rise to draw from the facial line along place limb of the compass at the point and describe from ac the line cc till it interfects the facial line at de- scribe in like manner from the point the line bb com¬ plete the chin and let the under lip prefs upon the upper at thus will the head of young man be changed into the form of an aged person the ear must also be raised to it is however to be observed that as the skin of the ear in aged persons becomes relaxed the ear itself seems longer this singularity could not be noted in the experiment may also be inverted and the head of young person be formed out of an aged one by alternately covering the dotted and complete lines with the fingers these different faces will more conspicuously manifest them- selves chapter iv form of childrens heads in front the same heads of children that were represented in profile in the fourth plate are in the fifth plate re- presented in front their proportions were taken into con- sideration in the first chapter of the second part the eyes of new-born children are very large which pro- ceëds from the size of the cavities and tliey stand at con- fiderable distance from each other but this distance is not quite the measure of an eye the nose and mouth sufficiently indicate themselves the head is very flat because the back part of the head mm is extremely broad which is the usual form of most children in this country the different parts of the face correspond with the general proportions remarked in the heads of children in child one year old see fig of this fifth plate the eyes are still very large the lower part of the face is longer and the forehead is higher mm through the weak- ness of the bones continues to increase in breadth that neither of these countenances are very pleasing will easily be perceived the following proportions are observable in child one year old see fig of this plate the height of the head compared with the breadth at the external canthus of the eye kk is as to mm rr breadth mm kk po so that four times po or one less than kk supposing the eye to be made larger than po that is as that is be po the third and fourth figures have placed the facial ine as in adults in the g and rooth degree of inclina- tion see sz plate to find the angle of the chin have made equal to thus the head gains in the height which is equal to st according to these limitations have also sketched the face in figure the fifth in front ab is thus equal to divided into two parts dg gives twice df in breadth which is the medium proportion between mm and kk of figure the second the head is therefore only four eyes in breadth which is the true proportion and not five as de wit has represented the fifth figure is not perfectly accurate is too high and df rather too small predecessor has done the same and others have followed their examples van dyk has also given the proportion of five eyes to the figure of an infant jesus the heads of quesnoy ’ children perfectly correspond with the above rules but the eye-sockets should have been within the perpendicular line fig as they project too much which is not graceful part the third chapter on beauty particularly beauty of countenance no definition is more difficult than the definition of beauty horace who has treated the subject in so masterly manner as far as it relates to poetry considers it in comparative view and not immediately and absolutely boileau and pope have also some excellent observations but these are confined to the elucidation of the style of poetry by comparing it with painting or of the latter by its affinity with the former roman and more modern writers advise us to take the antients for our models but recollect none who have explained in what beauty in itself or abstractedly confists longinus has afforded me the most satisfaction as he has treated the beautiful and the sublime in more syste- matic manner and has illustrated his doctrine by pertinent examples crousas hutcheson and father andre have made occa- sional observations concerning the beautiful the remarks of hutcheson manifest taste and judgment those of andre indi¬ cate much learning formey has prefixed an excellent pre- face to the works of andre each of these authors has made ust distinctions and sensible observations concerning the beautiful but none of them have informed us what it is that constitutes the beauty of painting of statue or of build- ing like the preceding they have merely treated the subject in cursory manner or by way of allusion in every representation not merely of historical scenes landscapes and sea-prospects but of simple groupes even of single figures it is necessary to distinguishi between poetry or inventive phyfical or natural and mechanic or operative beauty the first species is subject to laws which are appli- cable to poetry in general the second respects the forms of things the beauty of which it is not easy to reduce to any particular rules just ideas of operative beauty or the beauty of execution can only be acquired by practice philosophers have proceeded farther they have enquired what is it that renders us susceptible of the impression of beauty what is it that renders beauty the decided object of our choice but although their investigations have ma- nifested much depth of thought the result has not been com¬ pletely fatisfactory the celebrated mr. burke has clearly demonstrated in his excellent treatise on the sublime that whatever both in nature and art excites apprehension or wonder may partake of its nature in this species no rules of proportion can be proposed as the cause of beauty the starry heavens the rising of the sun or calm sea are pleasing to all every one feels pleasurable sensation at the fight of these objects and he calls them beautiful tempestuous ocean gloomy forest or even the darkness of the night imprefs us with pleasing ideas of the grand and sub- lime as mr. burke has demonstrated in striking manner the beautiful in works of art is not always distinguished with equal facility the more they are complicated the less are their beauties discernible by the vulgar poetic natural operative beauty must be felt by every one who lays any claim to taste and he must be able to disciiminate what is excellent in works of art from every mixture of imperfection it is alone by study by contemplating the best productions of artists and by forming comparisons that à genuine know¬ ledge of these three species of beauty is to be obtained in academies of painting skilful masters should instruct their pupils to contemplate separately the poetic or inventive part the sketch or design and the execution and also in the manner of correcting any defects that may be conspicuous this subject is much too copious to be enlarged upon in the present treatise our principal object is to contemplate the beautiful as manifested in the human figure and particu- larly in the head shall confine myself to the enquiry why is person whose height is equal to eight heads deemed siner figure than one who is only six or less than six heads in height laplander is universally considered as à less pleasing figure than persian or georgian is it because the stature of the one will measure eight heads and of the other merely six it must be acknowledged that this difference can not be ascribed to any determinate proportion of the parts simply and abstractedly considered for child whose height is merely qual to four or five heads is thought as beautiful as an adult equal to eight it is however acknowledged that the pleasing is often confounded with the beautiful we are pleased with the playful vivacity the perfect simplicity the affectionate at- tachment of child we also possess an instinctive fondness for children and it is possible that we blend all these cir- cumstances in our ideas with the beauty of person it often happens that the figure of child abstracted from these con- siderations has nothing pleasing in it the idea of beauty is sometimes excited by certain con- formity or proportion of component parts with each other for example we see with pleasure that the lower extremities measuring from the pubis to the feet are precisely the half of our bodies in length that the head is one-eighth the face one-tenth and the foot one-sixth the head of an apollo venus à laocoon is universally allowed to be finer or more beautiful than the heads of our best propoitioned men and women whence does this pro- ceed perhaps it is because in antiques the eyes are placed exactly in the centre of the head which is never the case with us when the breadth of the cheek from the nose to the ear is exactly equal to the breadth of two nofes which proportion was observed by the antients it is the most pleasing to us and we prefer those models to others which make the to whatever is beautiful in itself and does not depend upon external circumstances or mere opinion and of the existence of this species of beauty there can be no doubt some re- lation and proportion between different parts of the subject seems absolutely requisite the proportions given by the antients to their figures are not beautiful in our eyes merely from weak prepossession in favour of all that they have handed down to us but because they have corrected the defects which arise from the laws of vision for example when the object ab see plate ix is viewed so that the observer shall always be at an equal distance in eg or whereby eca gh aa ab the height of its surface the angle of vision will always be larger in than in or in as objects are measured according to the angle of vifion they will appear the highest or most extended at the point here the line of vision ec forms right angle with it that is when eac and ecb are equal or rectangular in this case the angle of vision aeb is the largest angle suppose the eye to be placed at then is the angle agb smaller in proportion as the radius ac is larger being equal to one-half of right angle of as the secant becomes greater the angle of vision becomes smaller in an inverse proportion and diminishes the apparent length that is eab gab compared with dab must become proportionably less until ad the line of section being infinite the angle becomes or is anni¬ hilated that is until falls into ab moreover there is only one point from which an object can appear perfectly quadrangular for whether the eye ascends along the line df above or descends towards eb become smaller and therefore will ’ the perpendicular side of the object though perfectly quadrangular appear broader than it is high hence it follows that to make the height appear equal to the breadtb the angle db or db must be made equal to aeb mean that must be extended to or acquire the length of ab or in other words that the surface which was we will say eight feet in height and equal to its breadth db must be enlarged to io feet and three-fifths now as we may suppose head or complete figure to be formed of quadrangles it follows that fimilar imper¬ fection in vision will take place that must be remedied in let divided into eight equal parts be made to re- present stature standing upon pedestal at such an height that the eye of the beholder at shall be in line with the upper edge of the pedestal these eight equal parts will appear to the eye under the following angles of vision a the upper part of the head under an angle of the second portion from above under an angle of the third portion the fourth the fifth the sixth the seventh the eighth or lowest hence it is manifest that the head in the highest division appears to be of about half the size of that portion of the lower extremities that is contained in the lowest division this will explain the reason why the antients sometimes gave more than eight heads to their figures the pythean apollo has eight heads and an half proportion which in itself is consonant with all our ideas of beauty were the figures always to be viewed standing upon the ground it is easy to perceive that the apparent short- ening of the lower extremities must be remedied in corres- pondent manner that the object may appear to be not more than eight feet in height although in reality it is longer but when it is placed upon pedestal or in niche the visual shortenings of the upper part absolutely demand the attention of the artist that was not constructed after the model of well-propor- tioned man he also limited the proportions of the human body and its various parts these proportions are adopted by durer lomazzo van mauder and others hoogstraaten seems to have allowed only seven heads and an half which differs whole head from the proportions observed in the figure of apollo de wit gave the proportion of eight heads to all the figures of his own composition to the pythean apollo to the hercules of farnese and to the venus de medicis with very small variation if am not deceived there is some- thing of melancholy in all these figures which is not apparent in his own original paintings or drawings the figure of female on the title-page of his book of drawings is nearly nine heads in length he seems in this simply to have studied effect lib chap has sometimes eight but mostly seven heads in the proportions of his figures which is the cause of that heaviness that is so conspicuous in most of his works testa has given the proportions of eight heads and ight and an half to his figures bloemaart whose designs are mostly put into the hands of our youth is so irregular that he sometimes gives seven at others ten heads to his figures van mauder has proved that in some of the figures of michael angelo the size is equal to nine ten nay twelve heads in order to communicate more grace to stooping attitude most of the italians seem to have made their figures par- ticularly those of females too short modern french masters render their females more graceful by giving them the length of eight heads watteau began this style probably our ladies wear high heels to their shoes and high head-dresses to produce similar effect the proportion of eight heads pleases us because this is twice the length of the trunk door is not pleasing unless it be twice as high as it is broad the french make the doors of their houses more lofty which adds dignity without de- stroying the effects of symmetry for à similar reason it is that we hold the corinthian column to be more graceful than the lonic considering the capital as in the place of head the whole length of corinthian pillar is eight heads and an half laplanders tartars hottentots and brasilians whose heads are very large in proportion to their bodies can not please us or be deemed beautiful no more than the doric column could be called beautiful upon the revival of architecture architecture with attention will learn that the columns were were placed and afterwards the capital were raised until the column with capital and base had acquired the pro- portions of the human body but to return it was not my design to enlarge upon the subject we must restrict ourselves to the dimensions and forms of heads and shall now enquire what are the proportions observable in the heads of european and other nations chap ii proportions observable in the heads of european and other nations compared with the antique in profile in order to judge with more perspicuity concerning com- parative beauty in the form of the head shall give table of the proportions as have found them in the best formed heads have divided the height of each into four parts that the length may be afcertained with greater pre- cifion the same letters are placed by each figure that the differences may be the more obvious see the sketches of all the profiles placed under the bones of the cranium it appears from the above table that the antients observed medium proportion for example from the tip of the nose to the ear in calmuck is and in an european and in the antique and -sths and the chin nine-tenths eight-eighths and two-thirds the beauty of the face depends therefore upon the relative proportions which the parts have to each other as or thus also when the face is seen in profile the breadth ough not to exceed the height as in the negro and calmuck in us they are nearly equal the form which approaches to the juadrangular gives certain flatnefs to the countenance the antients have removed this imperfection by making the head higher which proportionally diminishies the breadth when the faces are contemplated in front as they are represented in the third plate considerable differences will be observable for example the greatest breadth of negro ’ head is equal to thrbe- fourths of its height and the cheeks mn are as in calmuck the cheeks mn are in european in the antique the breadth of the negroe ’ head po is aa- calmuck european antique- hence it appears that the countenance of the antique is not only more elevated but that it is considerably less broad in proportion from the form of the eye-sockets it is obvious that the temples can not be broader than the bony parts together with the skin now xw in the negro is as in the calmuck judge of the dimensions of the eyes xw must be divided into three parts within the rim of the eye-sockets thus there remains for xpxwo only one-fourth of the whole breadth po all those who have written upon proportions as alb durer de wit allow the size of five eyes for the breadth of the face in children durer has given six eyes but am convinced that the head in no instance can be so broad the antients have never exceeded four which corresponds the nearestwith the breadth observable among us in children the distance between the eyes see plate fig po is equal to one-third from kk or the temples although from the disease above mentioned the head of the child represented in the second figure is five eyes in breadth n comparing this with figure the fifth of the same plate it will fully appear that the addition to its breadth is no addition to its beauty painters in general seem to be much embar- rassed concerning the breadth of the face as appears from de wit alb durer and le brun who never give lefs than the measure of five eyes the celebrated quesnoy has been much more careful and fortunate in giving not more than four eyes as the breadth of his heads if mistake not testa has observed the same proportion in his children the breadth of the nose is always determined by the dis- tance of the lateral processes of the upper maxilla see plate iii ef in proportion to the distance between and will be the width of the nofe it is because the triangle cor forms so large an angle that the disproportion appears so considerable in the nose of negro in us the nose is generally broader than the distance between the eyes the antients have observed the same proportion the mouth must completely cover the dentes canini as has been already shewn it must therefore be broader as these are placed at greater distance from each other but suppose the distance to be in reality the same that is sup- pose qr in figures the fourth and fifthy to be perfectly equal yet the mouth will appear smaller when the two sides of the triangle rise high compare yz in each figure in antiques the mouth appears smaller than with us from the greater depth of the chin the antients have made the mouth but à little wider than the distance between yz and the nose to incline downwards this position of the nose makes the upper lip small thus it curis as it were up- wards which gives it more graceful form the upper lip of the calmuck and of the negro is directly the reverse the antients made the neck twice the length of the nose but in apollo it is as this proceeds from the size of the nose which being longer the neck has still the usual length in children de wit has not given more than one-third of nose for the neck quesnoy somewhat more about the or double chin to his young children which always takes place and makes the chin about one-fourth of the nose longer chapter iii to find the proportions of the head most of the painters and drawing-masters who treat of proportions in their publications take vitruvius among the antients and albert durer among the moderns as their guides and to establish their own principles they repose upon the authority of ancient statues without paying any farther attention to the human body or measuring any particular parts af it with care and accuracy the portrait-painters of the present day generally de- scribe an oval upon their panel before the person to be painted sits to be drawn make cross in the oval which they divide into the length of four nofes and the breadth of five eyes and they paint the face according to these di- visions to which it must be accommodated let the proportions themselves be ever so much at variance mean not to insinuate that eyes nose and mouth or the curls of wig are to be measured with precision which have seen done by celebrated master and with very ill success for it is impossible to adapt this mensuration to the panel because every part has distinct surface and can not be brought upon correspondent surface on the panel it is simply my opinion that every good painter or designer should commence upon the proper basis that is should pay attention to the varieties which exist in the skeleton and particularly in the bones of the head in national characters and circumstances of the like nature and then let him sketch his oval or any other figure not according to his own fancy but according to his model perhaps it would not be improper to make use of the an- cient method of drawing which pliny has ascribed to the daughter of dibutades of sicyonia and which is now prac- tised for amusement by persons of fashion that is to trace the shade of any one intended to be painted by means of lamp if the portrait is to be in profile and then ascertain the precise situation of the principal parts as eyes nofe mouth and chin but in fact the nicest proportions must in general be obtained by an attention to multitudes and by imitating the example of zeuxis who selected from great variety of persons some minuter graces which enabled him to compose the proportions that were the most pleasing as the skeleton and the cranium served my purpose the best in drawing head it has been my practice first to sketch the cranium with as much attention and accuracy as possible upon which afterwards placed the softer parts this method has been omitted in the present work as it would have rendered my principal object more obscure and intricate although it would have enabled me to render my figures much more graceful and pleafing some of the bony parts are always marked on the coun- tenance they are never covered so as to be totally effaced such as the rim round the cavities of the eyes the jugal bones or of plate fig and and in plate fig the elevation above the nole and the deprefsion immediately under it the ridge of the nose or the termi- nation of the nasal-bone see plate iv.. fig lower edge of the inferior maxilla in the region of the chin and at its foremost angles manifest themselves and point out divisions the temples approach to the cavities of the eyes which always limit the breadth of the face the orifice of the ear also gives determinate point and indicates of itself the seat of the lobes which are to be placed imme- diately under it and of the ear itself to be placed imme- diately above it in word the bories of the cranium are simply covered with skin and dipose membrane and these are no impedi¬ ments to our taking the cranium as the truest basis of the intended portrait it was in this manner that obtained the profile of the modern face in the first figure of the second plate this was very similar to many other sine heads that have been dis- sected by me in my professional character and were after- wards sawn through the middle perpendicularly that might be able to obtain perfect profile have drawn several of these with pen and thick ink upon plate of glafs placed over them and the sketch has afterwards been taken upon varnishied paper it was by those means that formed no small collection which was of considerable service in the course of my lectures and of which have made use in the right line upon every spot the above method is much more files for the rays of light proceeding from one point di- verge in an unequal manner yet it must be allowed that death ’ head does not accurately resemble the living and also that by being sawn through it is less perfect than when observing that the linea facialis inclined backwards see plate ii fig mg. making an angle of eighty degrees with nc have preserved in the second figure all the pro- portions of the under jaw and placed perpendicularly forming the angle mnd equal to ninety degrees that is right angle every part which touches the facial line in the first figure as tng touches it also in the second the cranium re- tains its depth that is td in the second is equal to td albinus makes the line oo degrees alb durer has made it in man in woman and in child de wit has made it in women degrees see tab xi xii in apollo see tab xii in man and in child tab in the first figure but the space cd is diminished in pro- portion as me is increased cd is now lefs than nc although it was much larger in the first figures and the height ce is increased from to afterwards made mg. incline sive degrees more for- wards as in plate ii fig so that mnd formed an angle of degrees is still more diminished and ce becomes larger that is ey is equal to hm the projection beyond the line hg the lower maxilla is smaller and becomes more under the ear yet hk or the distance from the tip of the nose to the ear remains the length of two nofes and the neck is more graceful finally let the line mg. fall to by which the height equal to hm was gained see plate iv fig by these means the line that crosfes the eye at passes exactly over the centre and gains proportion correspondent to that of the antique that is form of head which is four noses in length every other part being in proportion it is to be remarked that the external rim of the eye-socket remains in the three last figures at an equal distance from the perpendicular line hg this projection constitutes the maximum place the facial line more forward and becomes too elevated the head is more than the proportion of four noses the upper lip too small and the face deformed if it be now askced what is meant by fine countenance we may answer that in which the facial line mg. makes an angle of roo degrees with the horizon the ancient they have gained the proportions of the different parts from the principles which have advanced am not able to decide it is certain that such form is never to be met with among moderns and doubt whether the ancient greeks themselves had living models of the form for neither the egyptians from whom they were probably descended nor the persians nor even the greeks have ever given such form when they simply aimed at delineating portraits* this antique beauty therefore is not in nature but to use the term of winckelman it is an ideal beauty thus when the greeks formed medallions of the roman emperors although hey were obliged to observe resemblance yet they added something of the ideal beauty this characteristic will easily enable connoisseur to distinguish grecian from roman medal have never found this characteristic so conspicuous as in the museum odescalcum where not only the counte- nances of several women but even the larvae or faces of the masks manifest the line as there is maximum on the one side so is there minimun on the other as soon as we recede to degrees « see the portrait of augustus caesar pharnaces and others plate ix fig and give the countenance of negro as in the third figure of the first plate lower than gives the features of an ape still lower the resemblance of dog the utmost extent that can be allowed for the face of an european is ten degrees behind and ten degrees before the perpendicular line hi all that exceed in either direction lose their beauty and even become mishapen but the ne- groes have also their maximum and minimum of comelinefs of these can not speak with precision as competent num- ber of heads are not in my possession nor have enjoyed sufficient opportunities of comparing them however the facial line must not sink much lower than five degrees that is to as the countenance would too closely resemble low it would approach to that of the dog have observed that in all quadrupeds both genus and species may be distinguished by the position of the bones of the upper jaw immediately before above or obliquely under the ball of the cranium have drawn the heads of many different animals upon the same line which exhibits an ap- pearance that not only would be of inconceivable service in natural history but of infinite service to the painter but this subject is foreign to our present purpose and to do it ustice would be to write volume what has been remarked concerning adult persons is also applicable to children in the fourth plate have faithfully copied after the ori- ginals before me in both the facial line was perpendicular which has not been favourable to beauty or to pleafing countenance the fourth figure of the fifth plate exhibits much finer face although the eyes are not in the centre the upper rim of the socket of the eye being about the central point according to the rule observed by de wit in imi- tation of quesnoy and fiammingo only the occiput is too long respecting this article have not been able to find out any determinate rule for infants when the child arrives to the age of three or four years the lower maxilla shoots downwards and the occiput becomes less it does not appear to me that we are under any obligation servilely to copy this unpleasing shape in our figures of young children parti- cularly as in this country it proceeds from weakness which renders the heads of children larger with us than in any country in europe when the facial line falls more forwards see sz of plate fig and the whole form becomes destitute of regular proportions and the head assumes an hydrocephalous appearance therefore the utmost extent with children as well as with adults is from to degrees réspecting the mouth it is to be observed that children having neither teeth nor projecting alveolae in either the upper or lower maxilla the tongue can not easily be confined within the mouth so that they have generally the mouth open that is the lower jaw is kept at distance from the upper and this gives something of an oblique direction to the lower part of the face see in the second figure and xeb fig we may add that the lower jaw is shorter than the upper and as it does not make large angle with the hindmost part see in all the figures of plate iv the mouth opens more easily and wider but still the orifice of the ear see of plate fig remains the central point by line from which to the point the inclination of the child is to be limited quesnoy has been very attentive to these peculiarities and he has made the line db describing the distance from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin very long see plate fig under or double chin is more strongly marked by this position the neck is shorter and the whole is more pleasing de wit on the contrary has taken his proportions from under the nose to under the chin as being equal to one- fourth of the height for this reason has he frequently given closed mouth to his children which renders them less pleasing than the children of quesnoy in most persons the ear is of equal length with the nose that is one-fourth of the height of the head it seldom stands higher than the middle line and the lobe generally sinks lower than the nasal line alb durer makes the nose preisser ’ figures of childrens heads are taken from alb durer and have the same faults in table part iii the chin comes too forward and is too long his connected with the general smallness of the features makes mixture of infancy and manhood in the same face of an adult about this size de wit makes them larger and seems careless about proportions in his twelfth table the lower part of the ear is on line with the nose and the upper even with the rim of the eye-socket and thus more than one-fourth in fig and of the same table the lobes are not placed so low in general he has placed the ear too high and even the orifice which never varies being always parallel with the line of the nose alb durer and all his followers have done the same the propriety of my remarks is demonstrated by the accurate figures of ofteology in the tables of eustachius where the ear is represented pa¬ rallel to the nasal line attention must also be paid to the breadth of the ear de wit generally makes the breadth too small the antients have avoided representing the ear naked as much as it was possible in which they are to be commended as in itself it is not pleasing figure the cavities the rim the- lobes and other parts are too small and insignificant to suffer to cover the ear itself and to make the lobes alone visible however in some cases they must appear totally as in the representation of bald head in this case the breadth should be equal to half of the height it should be drawn in an oval the long central line of which should be made to incline à little backwards but if the facial line be made to project forwards to the degree then should the central line be perpendicular as in this case the upper part is already at à greater distance from the nose than the lower in negroes calmucks this line must be made to run parallel with the facial line few painters have attended to the real structure of the ear almost every treatise on the principles of drawing that have seen is defective in this article the french appear to be the most attentive to it in the dictionnaire encyclo- pedigue the writer of the article upon the principles of drawing has given very accurate representation of the ear in the book of drawing by bloemaart there is not one figure of the ear that is natural nor even in that by preisser notwithstanding he has taken more pains than any of his brethren to ascertain its exact proportions in children the ear is very broad and large as well as the head it is therefore best to conceal it as has been al- ready observed since the ear can not add to the beauty of countenance in the above disquisitions have endeavoured to draw from nature herself the constituent principles of beauty in the form of the head am far from asferting that rigid conformity to the rules laid down will always enable us to aug. carrache disoit que ’ oreille etoit la partie du corps la plus difficile dessiner il en modela une plus grande que nature pour en faire connoitre la structure il en fit

from executing the design the sew coins and intaglios represented in the tenth plate though so trivial in themselves may serve to corroborate what has been remarked in the author ’ introduction to

sure hand in sketching heads in every position and of every age no one has ventured to deviate from the method notwithstanding every one must have been convinced from experience that this figure is frequently defective and merely applicable in few instances this shall endeavour to demonstrate plate vil fig let the height be divided into four equal parts ah hi if fb of these take two-thirds or

corresponds with the proportions given in the second chapter of the third part of this treatisef this oval is good one and seenis well adapted to all those cases where ovals can be applied with advantage but when the features are to be delineated in profile as in the second sigure of the same plate the manner appears to me totally destitute of the least advantage let ir be the length of the head and or uv the height form-your oval as in the other figure this oval limits nothing neither the situation of the ear nor the direction of the facial line xy nor the seat of the eye all these must be placed according « van de pas has formed the oval in this manner sce page the manner which alb durer followed in his first book of geometry is more complex and less perfect see the latin edition paris page fancy or by guefs besides the cranium itself is not of circular form books on drawing recommend the oval also for face that is placed sideways between the profile and front direction as in fig well draw the oval as before and describe the central line deb in the direction of the oval then divide the oval into four parts and the lower division into three parts and you will find the points of incidence in the four divisions viz in the line adb this is the manner laid down by preisser most portrait-painters follow this rule and they always place the mouth on the middle line which is too near to the ear it would not be difficult to demonstrate this or to prove that all the figures formed according to thefe rules of preisser are defective the same error is observable in faces and if recollect rightly goltzius has also com- mitted it in order to be convinced how much this method is de- fective draw the facial line dqr upon your oval accord- ing to the third figure of the fourth plate either inclining or erect as may be required then you will sind the points of it appears from the author ’ notes that he had intended to treat this subject more amply see part plate incidence to be let these be considered as the middle points and the countenance becomes natural van dyk has paid due attention to this and also many of the italian masters it appears therefore from the above example that in such cases the oval is deceitful guide drawing-masters ought not to sketch these lines upon flate or any flat sur- face but on ball of wood or clay properly modelled chapter ii of the use of the triangle in sketching profile tyoet carrache and some others teach us that to draw the face in profile an equilateral triangle must first be formed as abc fig of plate vil that the foremost line ac must be divided in three equal parts fof the face that is the forehead nose and chin but the point is of no use unlefs to place the ear within it then indeed would the space between and be equal to two noses measuring from the lobe to the line inter- secting the nostril but the lower maxilla would be thrown backwards as in cand which is disproportion never to be met with in nature however it is allowed that by this method the facial line is admirably well preserved thus far is the triangle preferable to the oval some artists and particularly le clerc in his copy of le brun ’ figures of the pafsions have used the small equi- lateral triangle dec when one side of the triangle lies on the facial line the point will mark the orifice of the ear with accuracy so that the distance from to or rather shall be equal to two nofes but he has not applied it in this manner and therefore it neither marks the proper boundaries of the facial line nor of the ear besides this triangle only gives half of the face with the ear for these reasons think it of no great use vischer in his fundamentales regula artis pictoriæe et sculpturae uses the larger triangle marked by our bc parizet in his treatise entitled nouveaut livre des principes du dessin has adopted the triangle of le clerc and with no greater advantage the great uncertainty and imperfection of the common methods made me desirous of inventing some other which should promise to be more certain and more generally appli- cable this object had long employed my thoughts and think with success chapter iii new method of delineating the head deing perpetually conversant with the skulls and faces of the dead and having attentively examined them after they were sawn through for anatomical uses in the manner already described and having also diligently traced the growth of the maxilla and of the nose in the heads of infants that were but few weeks old an idea suggested itself that in drawing or painting of the head the best method would be to imitate the process of nature first to form the cranium or skull then mark the facial line in the direction required and afterwards arrange the other parts according to given proportions the skull is an horizontal oval of which the hindmost parts are the largest and the fore-part rounded like the section of ball or globe first draw this oval by means of two circles the one is slvew which contains about three parts of the head the other kuz which is in size eight- ninths of the other circle draw the horizontal line st. which extends from the centre of the large circle to the centre of the smaller and is one-fourth of the larger circle from the centre let fall the perpendicular line sq this marks the seat of the orifice of the ear and of its lobe at draw pg the facial line in the degree of inclina- tion required marks the place of the forehead the line of the eye the nose and third of or mouth complete the oval zve which marks with sufficient accuracy the lower edge of the eye-socket take gn which may be equal to the size of the nose or less according to the inclination of the facial line and thus mark the commencement of the neck this manner is perfectly simple natural and indicates all the principal parts in the proportions required not to observe that it is easier to strike an horizontal oval than perperi- dicular one to delineate person advanced in years first draw the oval klve and the facial line pkhg see plate viii fig as in every aged person the teeth are wanting and the alveolae are obliterated by which the maxillæ have lost about one-third of their size pursue the method recom- mended in describing the second figure of the sixth plate to ascertain the present place of the chin considering to be the seat of the chin in its more perfect state place the compasses in and draw from the curved line gg and place the tip of the chin at which is about two-thirds from ib next divide gi into three equal parts the upper of which is for the mouth also draw the protuberance kf as this generally projects considerably from the facial line in very aged persons finally take the length of nose at gn and sketch the neck no thus obtain an aged face with all its characteristics in the most perfect manner in children the form of the cranium being similar see plate viii fig the oval must be drawn as before then the perpendicular line nq next the facial line pg since children have not the protuberance on the forehead as has been remarked the see fig and must be placed within the perpendicular line whereas in the first figure it touches and in the second it projects beyond it the eyes are two-fifths of the whole height meafur- ing from under the chin and three-fiftbs from the top of the forehead this agrees with the proportions of de wit and alb durer the distance from to the place for the nose is equal to one-fourth of the line lq but as the upper and lower jaw are from causes asligned already one-third nar- rower in young children as well as in aged persons the line must be drawn from ab to lq and the oblique line cd as was explained when we considered the fourth figure of the fifth plate thus is the point of incidence for the tip of the chin and for the mouth is now divided into five parts also three-fifths of which will indicate the line of the eye and two-fifths are destined for the face in drawing the sketch first strike the oval then draw the facial line pg let be noted upon the line dc and then draw line from to the origin of the neck behind and all the principal points will be accurately noted when the mouth is to be represented more open must be placed pro- portionably lower and more backwards sketch drawn in this manner gives the most natural re- presentation of child ’ face to delineate the negro see fig of the eighth plate similar method must be observed after the oval is formed draw the facial line pg inclining backwards according to the rules laid down in the third chapter of part the first then draw à line from to and you have the point of incidence at which limits the mouth thus you obtain the particular form of countenance being equal to one-fourth of points where the neck commences the other parts and their proportions have already been too fully described to render more circumstantial detail necessary thus is the remark of philostratus verified that lines sim- ply drawn with chalk may characterize the indian by flat nose stiff hair prominent jaws this manner of sketching is acquired with equal ease with the one in common use it is also perfectly applicable to the representation of the passions of the mind in the ex- pression of astonishment fear when the mouth is open the chin must be placed lower and more backwards the concomitants must be expressed by the action of the muscles and this action of the different muscles in the excitements of passion may also be explained in physiological manner with as much accuracy as flatter myself has been observed in these delineations of different nations and ages the diversity of countenances is made by varying the proportions and changing the position of the facial line these give large scope within the limits of resemblance and also of beauty the rules given by alb durer in his treatise concerning the manner of changing statues and the features of the face life of apol of

oftentive effects must refer you to the treatise of junius on the know- ledge of the antients in painting if you wishi to be informed concerning the extent of this knowledge it is true the principal performances of their renowned masters are lost but had investigated the influence of pain not merely does the face but the arms legs in short all the muscles of the body indicate anguish the lovelinefs of the venus de medicis -- the dignity of the pythian apollo -- the deities male and female engraved on precious stones -- the different mafks -- the sportive fawns manifest that expression of countenance constituted no small part of the excellency which is so much admired in the statues paintings and engravings of the antients the fine arts were buried under the bad taste that pre- vailed during the middle ages until from the fourteenth cen- tury every branch of science began to revive and in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries they flourissied with such vigour that europe seemed to require pause to rest from the fatigues of producing so many eminent characters but to return paullo lomazzo in his valuable work dell arte della pittura published so early as in the year describes the influence of the passions upon the mus¬ cles of the face and still more minutely the different postures and contortions of the body he relates that mi- chelino miianese artist had painted two peasants and two country girls who laughed so heartily that no one could look at them without laughing he tells us also that to draw latghing features was the great amusement of da vinci but need not inform you that at the period referred to cari- catures were so much the mode that at length they became disgusting leonardo also who flourishied at the beginning of the sixteenth century very naturally describes in his im- mortal work on painting all the various changes of counte- nance but like lomazzo he has chiesly studied the different attitudes of the body both these great men seemed more attentive to general effect than to particular features to the list of great men who have distinguished them- selves in this department may be added the names of michael angelo and raphael who seem to have made the different expressions of countenance their principal study well re- member the astonishment felt when first contemplated the penitence of peter painted in one of the cartoons and who can remain insensible to the anguishi of proserpine when forced away by pluto as it is chiseled out in stone by buonarotil however no one has arranged the expressions of the dif- ferent passions upon the countenance more systematically than le brun who flourished about the middle of the seventeenth century he has executed this work in so masterly manner that every nation has followed his lessons and copied his examples the great buffon alone has ventured to deviate from him but not with the greatest success shall leave every connoisseur to decide whether be to blame in placing much inferior value upon his drawings than upon those of le brun all the authors have mentioned have either confined themselves to appearances or like le brun have reasoned metaphyfically concerning the operations of the mind with- out attending to the phyfical causes of the changes produced by these operations but in my opinion speculations concern- ing the manner of the soul ’ working or concerning the seat of the soul are of no use to the artist these belong to metaphyficians who by the way lose themselves in laby- rinth of terms or words with no desinitive meaning without having in the least explained the action of this immortal prin- ciple upon the corporeal and mortal frame pliny da vinci and junius have particularized the prin- cipal appearances but have mentioned little concerning the connexion that there is between the parts affected and still less have they particularized the changes which necessarily arise from the various affections of the nervous system wat- telet also has described the passions and their influence with much good sense and in strain of eloquence it shall be my object not to speculate concerning the workings of the soul but to enquire what changes take place in the body in consequence of its operations we shall investigate the ap- pearances produced the uniformity of these appearances and their influence upon the features of the face the first thing requisite is to acquire an accurate know- ledge of the form of the skeleton and particularly of the cranium the second to be well acquainted with the prin- cipal muscles of the face and their action thirdly to trace the nerves in their divisions and connexions with these muscles few examples will illustrate my plan and indicate its importance however novel it may appear an oppressed sorrowful and melancholy person lets his head sink downwards or he supports it with his hand the equipoise is no longer maintained by the muscles of the neck that is the nerves belonging to those muscles are rendered inert lively contented laugher on the other hand raises his head and his breast is agitated in the excess of the emotion he places both his hands to his sides as it were to support his body at length his legs begin to refuse their office and he would fall to the ground if the fit continued person in the impetus of rage beats with hands and feet stamps till the ground shakes under him and his face is convulsed in thousand forms deep reverence makes the tongue to falter an inward trembling impedes the motion of the body the most lively and expressive eyes are abassied and look downwards the heart slutters if shame accompany this emotion as is fre- uently the case the face neck and breast are immediately painted of crimson colour it would be endless to particularize every emotion in similar manner the observation deducible from these effects is that in every emotion of the mind particular nerves are affected consequently every painter ought to make himself acquainted with the construction and connexion of the nerves productive of these changes at least every one who under- takes to write systematically upon the subject should acquire such portion of anatomical knowledge as to be able to instruct his disciples in the general rules that slow from it the palenefs arising from fear or à sudden alarm depends equally with blusliing upon the action of the nerves these changes of colour may be accurately expressed by the painter and in this he has the advantage over the statuary engraver but orators and public actors have the superior advan- tage of giving the greatest force to the expressions of the features by exciting the requisite movements in the parts themselves as dissecting of human bodies has been my constant occu- pation ihave had frequent opportunities of examining which of the nerves communicating with these more active parts must have been particularly affected consequently which of the muscles must have been excited to action by those nerves and from the action of these muscles depending upon their origins infertions course and connexions we may easily learn what pleats in the face what kind of action in the hands they must necessarily occasion it is these appearances alone that propose to elucidate in the present lecture it may be objected that according to the above represen- tation the antients must have been acquainted with the ana- tomy of the paffions or that they together with raphael callot le brun and others have succeeded wonderfully without this knowledge -that hogarth himself who excelled in representing the passions was ignorant of all that have advanced to be so necessary -- that john steen who was fre- quently so inimitable in the delineation of the passions never dreamed of studying the muscles stript of their integuments or of acquiring an intimate knowledge of those nerves which so many anatomists themselves know but imperfectly notwithstanding these objections am well assured that my remarks will prove both important and acceptable to this audience tracing the operations of nature is always an useful employment vou will also see and admire her wonderful address and finally we shall point out method by which not only youth but painters themselves may make speedy progress in this most enchanting branch of the art we shall confine ourselves to the face shall first enable you to recollect the constituent parts of the cranium its form cavities connexions proportions secondly shall delineate the principal muscles of the face and mark the true situation of the eyes that you may be convinced that le brun has placed them too much inelin- ing downwards and that in his representation of laughter he has given an improper bend downwards to the inward angles of the eyes he has committed similar fault in weeping thirdly shall demonstrate that the pleats or wrinkles of the face must necessarily run in rectangular direction according to the course of the muscular fibrillæ fourthly shall exhibit before you some of the nerves in order that you may understand the immediate connexion several of these sketches were extemporaneous and have not been preserved which takes place in the action of some of the muscles in the same passion the sixth pair as they were denominated by ancient anatomists or the eighth of the moderns has long been termed the pathetic this pair communicates with the throat breast abdomen and by the intercostal muscles with the nerves of the arms and legs the fourth pair or the lesser pathetics produce wonderful effects in surprise in love in dying it is by the action of the seventh pair that we laugh blushi or look pale finally shall delineate the muscles of the èyes that just idea may be formed of their motion in the full vigour of life and in the article of death and subjoin some observations concerning the synchronous and alternate motion of the oblique muscles in friendly greetings and in tokens of respect in dying the eyes are drawn towards each other be- cause the power of the will ceases and the muscles act in consequence of the remains of life seated in them such are the principles we shall lay down the right study and application of which will enable the artist to ex- press the passions of the soul with the utmost accuracy and in their full energy examples shall first sketch death ’ head see plate fig the principal muscles of the face fig thirdly countenance perfectly placip fig fourthly express- ing surprise fig fifthly contempt fig sixthly complacency friendliness tacit joy plate ii fig laughter fig eightly sorrow fig weeping fig tenthly vexation and wrath fig finally the dying fig ii the quick transitions from one passion to another which am about to exhibit may not perhaps excite less surprise than that which the great ferdinand of tuscany experienced when he saw peter of cortona working with his pencil at florence the painter perceiving that the duke was parti- ularly struck with the figure of child crying convinced him that very few touches of the pencil would exhibit laughter he then restored the former strokes and the child was made to cry again to the no small astonissiment of the prince hope that you will experience something of the professor in demonstrating these changes made the requisite alterations on the same face and also pointed out the defects of other painters in fimilar manner this had powerful effect upon the audience which can not be produced to an equal degree by distinct figures similar emotion although it is not peter of cortona that handles the pencil but simply lover of the arts contemplate first the placid countenance fig every feature is at rest no one muscle is brought into particular action all are in state of repose without appearing relaxed or inert there is tranquillity in the eye void of languor and the lips are in unconstrained contact let us suppose something to present itself which excites de- gree of surprise or wonder fig the intercostal nerves are immediately affected and act upon the third pair hence the eye-lid is opened and the eye stands motionless in the socket the same nerve acts upon the eighth pair at the same time respiration is suspended the free motion of the heart is impeded and the mouth is opened as the maxillary muscles destined to this purpose are affected but as these act alone upon the lower maxilla the teeth are not discovered the hands are extended and more particularly the fingers from the action of their muscular plexus the effects of contempt are very different fig the fifth pair of nerves are put in motion thus are the eye- brows drawn inwards and downwards the mouth is firmly closed but as the lower lip rises in the middle it becomes arched the eyes are drawn sideways the musculus abducens and adducens acting togetber by the force of habit.- by making the head to turn towards the right and the eyes toward the left hand the passion is rendered more expressive fig in complacency friendly greetings and tacit joy those parts alone act which have an immediate communication with the seventh pair of nerves the angles of the mouth must never be drawn up alone without other tokens of an incipient smile great care should be taken to avoid drawing the eyebrows inwards an error frequently committed by the french in their portraits laughter fig in laughter all the effects produced by the former affection are greatly increased and others are superadded the whole countenance inclines forwards but without the attention being fixed upon any determinate object the outward edges of the orbicular muscles of the eye are contracted producing wrinkles and folds around the eyes the lips are opened by the action of the orbicular muscle on the external sides hence the teeth particularly the upper are made to appear small wrinkles arise at the corners of the mouth and the cheeks become fuller lf you would add an arch or wanton look place the eye sideways and contract the upper eyelid expressive of wink in sorrowful countenance fig the fifth pair of nerves are principally affected the mouth is drawn down- wards by the descent of the upper lip to add despair to this emotion the face must be made to look upwards and somewhat obliquely the brow must be furrowed with wrinkles and the middle of the eyebrows be drawn up- wards in weeping fig all the muscles which receive the fifth pair of nerves act in very forcible manner hence the corners of the mouth are drawn downwards the lower part of the nose upwards the eyebrows descend the eyes are nearly closed and tears are pressed out of the lacrymal glands if anger fig accompanies the emotion the action of the muscles draws the eyes wide open the eyebrows de- scend still lower and the teeth are violently compressed to- gether dying fig in dying it is to be observed first that all the muscles of the neck open the mouth and elongate the chin secondly that the pathetic nerves draw the eyes towards each other and thirdly that all the ther muscles cease to act what le brun terms veneration is not well expressed ’ as the eyes are represented drawn upwards by the action of the two oblique muscles alone whereas the upper and under musculi obliqui must act accept gentlemen these short specimens by way of elucidating my principles to represent every passion and possible emotion of the mind would require more time than could be allowed by one who professes to be an anatomist and not painter my sole object has been to awaken at- tention and excite spirit of enquiry that you may be in- duced to consult nature herself without indulging implicit confidence in the rules and examples given by the most ce- lebrated masters which are frequently imperfect if in these specimens have not answered your expectations if my ex- pressions have not been sufficiently explicit and my hand has failed in giving the requisite strokes of the pencil can still perceive by the satisfaction painted upon your counte- nances that my endeavours to please you have proved suc- cessful lecture ii concerning the points of similarity between quadrupeds birds and fish the object of the prefent and following lectures fhall be to shew the great similarity there is between quadrupeds and the resemblance of these to birds and fishi and also to indicate very easy method of delineating all these animals in the most exact manner should my audience deem the undertaking of little mo- ment or confider the precife form of animals as beneath the attention even of painters themselves could justify the design by quoting the laudable example of the antients the greeks the romans and before these the egyptians were obliged to pay the most minute attention to every species of animals not merely as emblems of their different idols but as insepa- rable from their sacrifices races triumphs but these could neither be painted nor represented in stone or metal without the knowledge of what constitutes the beauty and perfection of the animal creation the high value in which this art was held by the antients will moreover appear from the dog cast in metal which plinye informs us was preserved in the capitolium as an exquisite piece of workmanship with so much care that the superintendents were threatened with death in case of ne- gligence we read also that myron had formed so beautiful cow in metal that it was not only celebrated by the poets but copied by the most skilful engravers with equal zeal as venus or any other sine workmanship of the greatest masters count caylusf has this cow engraved on cornelian which is no inconsiderable addition to the cabinet of that celebrated connoisseur canachis acquired no less honour by hart which he had formed in copper that appeared so light and swift that thread might apparently be made to pafs under the feet tisicrates is immortalized by his lion simon by dog nicias by his paintings of several species of animals and androcydes by his skilful representation of fishi whoever consults the monumenti antichi inediti of win- kelman and particularly the introduction will be made acquainted with the high value which in the present day is placed upon the lion in the capitol the sphinx in the palace of borghese and also the other animals by the fountain deli aqua felice the horse has excited still greater ambition stiall not mention the story of apelles nor of his follower lysippus their successor calamis obtained such renown for his horses that he is not only celebrated by pliny ’ and cicero but ovid has immortalized him in his verses pliny says that he was unrivalled in his representation of cars drawn by two or four horses notwithstanding that lysippus and his disciple euthycrates had distinguissied themselves in this department the valuable cabinet of stoschj manifests how great master aspafius was in the engraving of horses hylus has also excelled in steers and lucius in horses many triumphant cars with four horses abreast are repre- fented in bass-relief and engraved on precious stones in manner that exceed all imagination they are mostly repre- sented with two and with four horses have never seen them with ten though nero introduced hunting with this number in the cabinet of count caylus there is an engrav¬ ing on cornelian of conqueror with twenty horses by the side of each other which can be minutely distinguished and of exquisite beauty it would be endless to enumerate all those who have ac- quired celebrity by depicting of animals let me recommend to you the catalogne of ancient artists arranged with so much judgment by franc junius this will inform you of the number of artists who have acquired immortal fame by their reprefentations of various animals we will now direct our attention to those great masters that were your immediate predecessors whose admirable per- formances must have made an indelible impreffion upon your minds who of the present asfembly does not pant after the immortal fame so justly acquired by van berchem potter wouwerman wenix an adrian van de velde houdekoeter and other great men which this country has produced so superior and so manifold are the excellencies of these masters that it would require too much of our time to particularize them yet do not recollect that any one except the indefatigable crispin van de pas has professedly written on the proportions of animals or has given to the ambitious student any rules to forward his success what da vinci has advanced upon the subject of horses is not adapted to give general ideas all that is commu- nicated by lomazzo is merely poetic description of the beauty of some animals charles vander mander amuses himself with trifles and lairesse passes over the subject in total silence my undertaking must consequently appear to you the more bold and hazardous but although the imperfections of the attempt can not escape the observation of this intelligent au- dience yet am persuaded they will sind an apology in its difficulties you will readily perceive that the idea could alone suggest itself by my attention to the close connexion there is between the tedious and indelicate employment of dissecting animals and the most elegant of the artsl to the accidental union of these two useful pursuits in the same person may be ascribed all that may be deemed useful in the following remarks will add that very large collection of the skeletons of different animals in my cabinet has given me frequent opportunities of comparing together their specific forms shall deem myself abundantly recompensed if my labours should awaken and direct genius to bring this part of the science to the perfection of which it is capable propose to give two lectures upon the subject in the first shall point out the similarities that exist between qua- drupeds of every kind between these and fowls and also fissi and finally indicate those peculiarities to which the painter or statuary should direct his principal attention between quadrupeds fowls and fishi and propose an infal- lible method of sketching all these animals and shall con- clude with demonstrating that like another proteus we may with few strokes of the pencil change cow into horse à stork or into any kind of fish we please will not waste your time by attempting to delineate ani- mals in the most perfect manner with the pencil of zeuxis but rather like agatharchus hastily draw the outlines and leave it to your taste and judgment to supply the minutia which add elegance to figure ishall be amply satisfied if you should be able to discover amidst these imperfect essays principles that may serve as the foundation of more perfect attempts no one who holds the art of painting in due estimation can doubt that it is the grand object of the artist to delineate his figures after the life and with the utmost accuracy or to represent by the closest imitation the different objects which all-bounteous nature has bestowed upon us in so rich an abun- dance yet it is highly advantageous and to excel abso- lutely necessary for the painter to acquire an intimate know- ledge of all those created beings he wishies to represent and to penetrate as it were into the plans and designs of the great creator in the formation of the astonishing variety which strikes us in the animal creation and which excites within us the pleasing emotions of wonder and admirationl shall begin with man whom we will confider as the most perfect quadruped and gradually descend to apes dogs the yerboa thence proceed to fowls and then pass over to the finny tribe perhaps you will consider the undertaking as extravagant and the expression unguarded but hope soon to convince you that fish and fowls as well as horses and cows may justly be deemed quadrupeds although they are differently formed that each may be able to exert the requisite movements in the most easy manner according to its particular station fach animal differs also in the form of its head body feet tail according to the design for which it was created yet extra- vagant as the position may appear shall prove that the oyster bound to particular spot contains the first principle other quadruped up to man himself would willingly give you ocular demonstration of the fact by placing before you sketch of each but this would be impracticable within the limits of the hour shall con- sine myself in the present lecture to the close resemblance that subsists between the different parts of these animals shall therefore delineate before you the skeleton of man of dog an eagle and penguin that you may be con- vinced of the likeness that subsists between them the fishi we shall reserve for the next lecture you perceive by this general comparison that man is the most perfect of all animals not because he walks with an erect countenance as plato and after him cicero and ovid have remarked as if it was peculiar privilege in man to look towards the heavens for as galen has justly observed several species of fish enjoy this privilege in more perfect manner the grand corporeal advantage enjoyed by man is that he can walk and even sit in an erect attitude the publication is necessarily imperfect concerning this very interesting article as the professor ’ principles can not be illustrated by the diversity of examples he delineated before the audience in which he demonstrated the grand points of resemblance and traced progressively the kinds and degrees of deviations from them may also add that man alone is able to repose upon his back and that by the centre of motion being placed in the middle of his body he is enabled to turn himself to bend peculiar facility all these advantages necessarily flow from other advantages which it would be foreign from our pur- every one that contemplates fine horse is struck with the beauty of his neck when we view camel the length of his neck and the smallness of his head strike us the most in the elephant its long trunk or proboscis is the principal object of admiration in the cow the thickness of its body is most remarkable in the greyhound on the contrary it is the thinness of body and slenderness of the feet that attract our chief attention in the mean time it is extremely obvious that these forms of particular parts are à necessary consequence of the ends to which these different animals are destined cicero has given us beautiful description of these singular differences which manifests his deep penetration into the designs of nature « some animals says he ce are low of stature that they may the more easily reach from the earth the food it affords for their nutrition but those animals which for wise reasons are taller as cranes and also the camel are assisted by the length of their necks elephants are furnishied with species of hand by which those ani- mals gather their food from the ground as the immense bulk of their bodies renders it impracticable for them to bend or stoop this idea is exemplified in the shark which although it has long teeth is destitute of snout which would be useless as that animal seeks and dévours its food while swimming in the water many are the instances of the necessity of fnout in some animals and its uselessnefs in others and nature has wisely made their forms correspondent galen has moreover justly remarked that in those animals which gather their food from the earth the neck is the length of the feet however worthy these observations of cicero and galen may be of their authors and applicable to our present purpose confess that had not an adequate conception of their im- portance until my remarks concerning animals were brought to some degree of perfection and those further discoveries were made which shall be hereafter explained that distinguissied naturalist ray has in his preface to willoughby treatise on fish expressed the thought of cicero in other terms he has further observed that fish are destitute of necks not merely because they have not feet but because they can procure their food in every part of the watery ele- ment without them aristotle has likewise remarked that sish are destitute of necks snakes are also without them and in this respect is their form very similar to that of fifh respecting the feet it is to be observed that the wise creator has uniformly made the fore feet of those animals whose stature renders long neck necessary lower than the hind feet as in the sheep the deer and camel and in such animals the dorsal vertebra gradually descend from the hips the giraffe is an exception being destined to other purposes if we attend to the belly we shall perceive that it is much larger in those animals that feed upon grafs than in the carnivorous class and in those which chew the cud than in those which do not the reason is evident the organs of digestion or in other words the intestines destined to con- vert animal substance into animal substance need not be so ample and voluminous as those whose office it is to trans- mute grafs into animal substance in this kind of vegetable nutritious particles are diffused over large surface while it is comprised in much smaller space in animal food the cow eats à large quantity at once and afterwards ru- minates the horse eats continually the cow must conse- quently have much larger belly than the horse and this larger one than the dog the comparative length of animals is also proportionate to the number of the vertebra of the loins some as the elephant have only three the horse has five the cow six the lion cat aud camel have seven u in animals that live upon gramina as elephants horses oxen deer camels and in all that chew the cud also in swine the feet are horned whether they be whole as in the horse or cloven as in the cow and sheep because the others are divided into two three four or five fingers as in man more than five fingers are never found in any quadruped in fowls the wings terminate in fingers all have thumb to each wing in the majority two fingers are super- added many are furnissied with nails as the ostrich and the spurred water-hen the above remarks are sufficient to evince this truth the more perfectly an artist is acquainted with the nature of animals and the designs of their particular formation the better he will succeed in his attempts to delineate them but as verbal descriptions may not be sufficiently obvious we will call in the aid of sketches the explanation of which will clearly indicate the truth and importance of my obser- vations example the horse see plate iii fic let bcdef limit the body and feet of the horse for the animal to move itself properly the feet must be as ge and hd in length trace the course of the spine with its cavity let be the foremost rib and the moveable point of the first vertebræ of the neck all quadrupeds have seven of these vertebræ inferences the neck and head of the animal must be so long that he shall be able to reach his food that is as -- when the head is small in proportion to the height of the animal the neck must necessarily be longer as takes place in camels sheep when the head is erect the neck must necessarily be curved either externally as ner or inwardly as in aged horses and the neck is more or less in the direction of sar in proportion as it sinks in order to support so long neck the processes of the vertebræ nearest ’ to the prominence of the neck or withers must be very long as in the horse see they are of consequence shorter in the animals whose necks are differently formed and the shortest in the human species as man carries his head erect it is to be remarked that the horse is furnishied with large muscle which runs over sc to and unites with the soleus at which empowers him to kick backwards with so much force and which is peculiar to this animal the cow being destitute of it this part of the body is consequently hollow by the way the head of bourgelat ’ horse in the hippi- atrique is too small the length from to or from the extremity of the shoulder to the extremity of the buttocks being two heads and two-thirds whereas it must be two and one-half as in the painting of stubbs and other good masters in the english model of horse stript of its integuments the head is only one-third of the length from to that is considerably shorter unlefs these animals were furnished with extraordinary long necks they would not be able to graze the height be from the withers to the hoofs is gene- rally equal to and mostly five feet have found the majority of heads to be two feet in length even in foals but the necks of these are proportionably longer example ii the cow plate iii fis draw the outlines of horse as before secondly shorten the feet from to and from to inference in consequence of this considerable difference in the length of the feet the neck of the cow need not be longer than from to and when stretched in stooping to graze as from toy hence the neck can not be arched as in the horse nor is it necessary but it gently inclines upwards the weight of the head always sinks it and also the horns lower than the prominence this is always the case in that species of cattle that is mostly known in holland it is for this reason that the withers or prominence is not so elevated as in the horse other peculiarities will manifest themselves example iii the dog plate iv fig draw as before the outlines of the horse and the line of the vertebræ contract the belly from gh to gz this difference being occasioned by the nature of the food as has been explained the neck of this animal is of various lengths as it fre- quently eats and gnaws its food lying as well as in standing posture the feet must be made slender in proportion to the swiftness of the animal as the thigh bone from to is longer than in horse the leg becomes proportionably shorter the tail must be made to spring upwards example iv the camel plate iv fic sketch as before but the feet must be made longer and the belly thicker in consequence of this difference the neck must necessarily be longer than that of the horse and the head though it be of equal size with that of the horse will appear smaller from the same cause when the head is erect the neck must be made to curve from beneath upwards contrary to that of the horse and in such direction that the position of the head may correspond with the centre of gravity in this animal as well as in the sheep and deer the ine must have only small degree of inclination upwards example the elephant plate fio draw the horse as before were the neck of this animal to be as in the horse from toi that is long enough for the mouth to reach the ground high and prominent withers would become re- quisite proportionate to the weight to be supported but this form could not take place according to the general con¬ struction of the animal therefore must the neck be short- ened as from to but the animal not being able to reach the ground trunk or proboscis becomes necessary the vertebra of the breast and back must now be made to form an arch the elephant has only three vertebrae of the loins and becomes proportionably shorter other peculiarities shall be left to your own observation lecture iii the subject continued it has been observed in the preceding lecture that no one excepting crispin van de pas has given us particular rules for delineating every species of animal with any degree of precision will now add that the skeletons which lay the foundation of the whole superstructure and direct the form both of men and animals have generally been repre- sented in so imperfect manner that they are of no use to the painter all the skeletons represented by coiters are extremely bad those of meyer are still worse nor is there à single one in the costly and in other respects excellent work of buffon that can be of the least service to the artist in all of thefe as in the productions of coiters the dorsal vertebra or back- bones are in right line the shoulder-bones with the bones of the fore arm the bones of the thigh with the shanks are also in right line thus are the feet in proportion to the length of the neck so long that not one of these animals would be able to reach its food from the ground cheselden in his valuable treatise on the bones has given us very large collection of the skeletons of different animals which are beautifully executed these have been engraved by vander gucht and schynvoet in masterly manner but after imperfect models those of the lizard the turtle the crocodile and the eagle are beautiful those of the bear rabbit and swan are inimitable the skeleton of the ostrich may serve but that of the hog is entirely useless upon the whole the skeletons of animals left us by cheselden are the most beautiful and accurate of any you will naturally suppose that the skeleton of the horse which is the most beautiful and most useful of animals must have been delineated with peculiar care and exactness but alasl exclusive of those painted by the great master in this department stubbs and engraved after his paintings know not of any that deserve commendation the representations of carlo ruini who led the way are ufeful to convey general idea of the anatomy of the parts but they can not serve the painter what then is to be ex- pected from the works of sannier and snape and of others which are merely bad copies from the imperfect engravings of carlo ruinil it is subject of still greater astonishment that in the celebrated royal veterinary school at charenton near paris there is not à single skeleton of horse that would admit into my cabinet although they were all mounted by bourgelat himself in every one of them the shoulder- blades and bones of the arms are badly placed the skeleton of the horse given us by buffon and that by la gueriniere are still worse than the preceding that of stubbs is masterly and accurate all the parts are properly placed are in just proportions and well delineated in his finissied pieces the muscles are represented with an ac- curacy that can not be exceeded in word his skeleton of master-piece that the author deserves the highest honours that were ever bestowed upon an artist if artists in general succeed so ill with the horse whose extensive utility places him perpetually before our eyes what is to be expected in the figures of other animals that have not been imitated by stubbs it is acknowledged that minute acquaintance with the anatomy of every animal would require so much time that no artist could possibly attain it observation also manifests before they were thirty years of age but an accurate know- ledge of the principal parts particularly of those which have demonstrated to possess general similitude is absolutely ne- cessary both to sketch the different animals with more expe- dition and with greater degree of precifion this seems to have been the method followed by potter berchem wouverman snyders castiglioni and the inimitable testa whose works can recommend for their peculiar accuracy shall not mention reidinger because all his animals few of his dogs and deer excepted are absolutely caricatures and have nothing but the execution to recommend them van berchem is not perfectly accurate in the disposition of the parts in his cows asfes the shoulder-blades are mostly imperfect particularly of those represented in front position the heads of his apes are bad many of his sheep are ill delineated though etched by himself the skeleton is uniformly imperfect yet his books for drawing are the least erroneous those engraved by vischer have the imperfections of their originals and the hairy covering is much inferior in the hunting of the deer by dankerts is beautiful horse but the body of the deer is too slender adrian van de velde has well delineated most of the cows in his book of horned cattle the bull in stand- ing posture is remarkably well drawn and also grazing neifer although its feet are somewhat too long in some the hip-bones are too long particularly in the walking cows his eating horse is bad the head is one-third too small for the height the prominence on the neck or withers is not high enough and on account of the smallness of the head the neck is of an unusual length some may think hat the painter should avoid as much as possible represent- ing horse in the act of grazing as the extreme length of the distended neck is no pleasing figure great address is re- quisite to make it graceful grazing cow which van de velde has etched himself is remarkably beautiful paul potter has etched bull which is much inferior to that of van de velde many of his cows are very imperfect in their form he is always embarrassed with the shoulder- blade this appears principally to be the case in those that have been etched by de bije but you will enquire why then do we consider the pieces of all these celebrated masters as so beautiful the expla- nation is not difficult our own imperfect knowledge of the exact form of animals renders us contented with what- ever is agreeably executed upon the whole we are en- chanted by graceful attitude by masterly stroke of the pencil or by the high finishing of the whole and this con- ceals our own ignorance as well as the imperfections of the artist the works of stoop are in some estimation by con- noisseurs but all his horses are ill drawn the feet are too clumsy the heads and necks are too small all his grey- hounds are inaccurate in short he scarcely deserves the name of master what shall we say of de vlieger his landscapes indeed are picturesque but his fowls are bad his hounds are imperfect in their shoulders and foré legs neither are his hogs or sheep accurate peter de laer has sketched his goats dogs affes and hogs tolerably well but his horses have the same imperfec- tions as those of stoop and his cows are bad joan vanden hecke deserves no commendation although he is not unknown to connoisseurs his horses cows asfes dogs in word all his animals are badly delineated flamen has succeeded very well in his fishes but his quadrupeds are very inferior to most others picart le roman has left behind him large collection of lions most of which are ill drawn some by rembrandt are extremely fine and that by alb durer is beautiful upon the whole but the heads of all are defective excepting those by rembrandt many painters give à disagreeable physiognomy to their animals through inattention to the pupil of the eye al- though the pupil is round in multitudes yet in all animals that graze it is oblong in an horizontal direction in lions tygers cats it is perpendicularly oblong in dogs the pupil is not in the centre of the eye but approaching to the nose respecting the teeth most artists are guilty of great errors ph wouwerman has not only painted his horses in very spirited manner but with more accuracy than have observed in most others those engraved by dankerts and joh de vischer place in the superior class of engravings to enumerate every particular would be an endless task let it suffice that have pointed out to you all such defects in the greatest and most celebrated masters as might have been avoided by the manner am about to explain but we will first examine what vander pas has done this artist in the fifth part of his work page the sixth has proposed what he deems an easy method of sketching the figure of horse without the rule or compass he draws square by the eye see plate vi fig bcd this he divides into nine equal parts see he then makes three circles one for the breech one for the belly and one for the breast and shoulders van mander has also recommended three circles and it is possible that van de pas who publissied his work in the year has copied the method of van mander which was published in de pas gives third part of the fourth and fifth squares to complete the shoulder and the lower part of the belly tenth square he destines to the neck the diagonal of which limits the length of the neck and head to the above method it must be objected first that very few persons would be able to form these squares with sufficient accuracy by the hand secondly the author has not explained the reason why the centre of these circles should be placed on the oblique lines fg nor how they are circumscribed according to this rule the crofs or crup- per rises higher than the withers at whereas the latter according to bourgelat should be one-tenth higher and according to stubbs it is at least of an equal height this proportion differs also from his own drawings see of his treatise thirdly by this method the head of the horse can not be one-third of its height for the height of the withers to the bottom of the foot is two heads and an half or rather the head is equal to one-fifth of the height and length of the horse fourthly he makes the heel and the fore hand of an equal height whereas the latter is the length of one head from the groun and the former it is manifest that the method proposed is imperfect and uncertain particularly when the animal is to be deli- neated in any other posture the proportions given by bourgelat are not bad but the head of his horse is too small the directions of one heinrich lauten saks ’ for delineat- ing the proportions of men and horses are highly praised by chr theoph murr but have never seen that pub- lication vander pas in the twenty-fourth page of his treatise gives the following directions for drawing the cow divide the length see plate vi fig into three parts twice one-third of which or four parts out of six describe the height of the animal and one-third its thick- nefs the head is made one-fourth of this line the other parts are not determinate nor does cow ever stand with its head so high thus the method proposed is of little use to the artist for it neither describes the height or shape of the withers back or loins nor does it limit the neck the same author in his twenty-third table proposes the following rules for the elephant he divides square into twelve equal portions and makes an oval for the rump with- out giving any determinate size but the whole figure is unterweisung der perspectief und proportion der menchen und rosse void of proportion nor has he delineated the feet in proper manner he has made the hind thicker than the fore feet whereas in elephants camels and horses the reverse is observable the skeleton given by perrault is very imperfect and out of all proportion the same may be asserted of that by buffon his representation of the elephant in plate made after model that is by no means satisfactory am positive that the model which had taken of an elephant is accurate in all its proportions but it was only calf and its head was in reality lower than its back the head of the elephant delineated by buffon has the promi- nence or withers higher than the rump was surprised at this difference but when was at paris last summer saw much larger elephant than that had modelled and perceived that the head and withers were higher this animal was in size between that of bufson and mine thus the proportions have given are only applicable to younger elephants in his twenty-fifth table vander pas has delineated camel and he has given an oval for the form of its belly every other part is also badly drawn the dogs represented in his thirty-first table are universally defective and also the rules he proposes for drawing the cat he also proposes in his forty-third table three circles for the deer the first smaller than the second and the second than the third but without explaining the reason or limit- ing the size of either circle since this artist is the only one who has attempted to give us rules for delineating different species of animals and have demonstrated the imperfection of thefe rules though it is acknowledged that the attempt was highly laudable shall now proceed to indicate method that is more simple and much more certain general rules applicable to all animals see plate fig the first draw the line bc according to the proposed length or rather according to the nature of the animal to be de- lineated of consequence inclined less inclined or more in- clined as in sheep camels draw the line fe to mark the shoulder-blade and ch for the hip-bone which for horse must be made equal to two-thirds of the head in length and for cow equal to the whole length of its head sketch also the bone of the arm by eg and that of the thigh by ik so that the elbow and knee in horse cow be exactly of height and even with the belly complete the fore and hind legs that is draw kl mn no op and gr rs st when rand are of equal length the heel ml natu- rally rises higher sketch the neck according to the nature of the animal and afterwards the head paying attention to the rules al- ready laid down see the preceding examples lecture ii by recollecting the observations made respecting the dif- ferent forms of animals according to their destination and also the difference in the length of the loins the above sketch may be made applicable to every case rule the second by sketching the muscles of the shoulder and fore arm the form of the fore leg will be obtained and by sketching the form of the hind leg rule the third the foremost rib is always rectilinear and covered by the shoulder-blade the hind ribs always incline obliquely back- wards in horse they run near to the hip-bone in cow the loins are longer hence proceeds the triangular cavity plate iii fig efg see page no rule the fourth in all animals with hoofs or horny feet the arms and legs from the middle to the lower joints are the longest fig rs and mn in all animals that spring forwards as lions hares dogs the thighs are much longer than the legs see the grey- hound plate iv fig of the above rules in delineating fowls plate vi fig draw the oval as before and place the arm in which is now folded up as the bird is in state of rest draw in like manner cd which may be termed the hand and df which corresponds with the thumb and de the remaining fingers draw next gh the hip-bone and the rump ik the ham kl the thigh lm the leg and the claws draw the neck qn proportionate to the height of the body and complete the head gr in some fowls the upper jaw or beak is very moveable to the extent of rs as in ducks if it be flying fowl the breast-bone must be fur- nishied with large rib destined to the insertion of muscles the oftrich and cassowary are destitute of this and also with an arched bone the merry-thought no for the same purpose by filling up with muscles the form of the thigh is obtained by placing the feathers upon these the whole form of the fowl cover first the wings then the thighs observations in order to place the centre of gravity forwards nature has formed in all fowls the back very short and made them destitute of loins many fowls have only six vertebræ and consequently not more than six ribs on each side which is scarcely more than one-third of the seventeen vertebræ with which the human species is furnisnied in the frog in which the centre of gravity is necessarily thrown back- wards the reverse takes place it was necessary that this animal should retain the loins in order to throw the strength of the muscles into its thighs and hind legs thus has the supreme creator rendered it almost destitute of back and placed the head contiguous to the loins for the same reason it is des- belon de mans has given two fkeletons tlie one of the human form and the gther of birds in which he has represented the resemblance of all the bones from the head to the feet in very satisfactory and elegant manner had not taken notice of this before the year see histoire de la nature des oiseaux pub- ished in pages of ribs and hence does its body appear so extremely shiort ii since it has been shewn that the fore feet of all ani- nals are correspondent with the wings of birds and also with our arms it is to the highest degree absurd to give wings to the human form as is the practice in the repre- sentation of angels cupids in like manner the ex- istence of centaur is impossible for this quadruped would in reality have six feet double breasts and two distinct bellies that neither tritons nor mermaids can exist will appear from the above remarks concerning the form of birds « it is observable that in all the birds which sly the pectoral muscles constitute the principal part of their bulk peculiarly strong muscles being necessary to com- municate such force to the wings that they should be able to suspend the body in the air and to propel it forwards were the painter to furnishi his angels with these muscles they would become monsters without them he supposes an impos- sibility this idea might be extended much further in the human form mass of pectoral muscles infinitely larger in proportion to that in fowls would be requisite in order to overcome the weight of man ’ posteriors which being intended to enable him to walk firmly upon the earth prevents him from springing more than few feet above it would not painters therefore do wisely to leave those unmeaning fans and in their representation of celestial beings trust to the lightness and elegance of their forms and divinity of their countenances lf custom has so far consecrated wings that they can not be dispensed with surely much more care should be taken than is generally observable that they be not made to carry greater weight than is absolutely necessary of the above rule in delineating fishes plate vi fic ii the similarity of fish to quadrupeds may be demonstrated in the following manner draw as before the oblong oval bacg as in plate fig since the fish neither have nor require neck excepting those that respire which are furnishied with fhort one place the head be immediately upon the back-bone as the rump has no distinct and separate motion though it is in equipoise with the water power is required similar to the oar of boat see ane of fig to which the fish may now be compared as great mobility is requisite in fish it is obvious that the tail ch becomes necessary and also the large transverse bones for the insertion of the muscles in proportion as ne or the tail is long will the fish be able to move itself with the greater velocity in all fish the head is joined to the first vertebra through the medium of cartilage in like manner as the vertebrae are united with each other inferences inference the boat would be the most steady were the centres of motion and gravity to unite in the same point this is impossible in boat but it always takes place in fishi hence it is that fish are able to swim in right line whereas the fore part of the boat must move from side to side but the fishi must keep itself in straight line and it is furnishied with fins for this purpose both upon the breast bf and under the belly at take away bf and the fish will fall upon its side inference ii since fisli are naturally in equipoise with the water and they all swim or row themselves forwards by means of the tail it follows that their position in the water must be horizontal of the head and upon this circumstance will depend the length of the tail since greater diversity of form can take place in fishi than in quadrupeds there is space for much greater diver- sity of species in the first than in the last the existence of such sea-monsters as mermaids and tritons is impossible and the idea of them absurd as these animals must be supposed to swim in an erect pofition the tail forming an acute angse'with the back whereas the centre of gravity would unavoidably force them into right line- but to return since fissi move by means of the tail they have no occa- sion for thighs legs or feet also from the nature of their food they do not in general require an offified jaw as in quadrupeds and fowls the natural history of the frog affords us curious and striking example of the changes respecting these circumstances appointed by the wise creator in conformity to the exigencies of the animal the frog is provided with tail as long as it is destitute of feet but when these protrude and have acquired sufficient force the tail gradually contracts until it totally disappears this singular phaenomenon might be con- templated every spring were not the animal too common and deemed too insignificant to attract our notice the transformation of quadrupeds into birdb plate vii fic change cow into crane draw the skeleton of the cow as in the second ex- ample raise this upon the rump ae in gc and the fore feet must necessarily rise from the ground as the centre of gravity can no longer be supported by the affistance of the fore feet the hind feet ef must be brought forwards to fi the carcase or body being raised so much higher above the ground the neck must be extended to gh and the head must be placed backwards to be supported in hi the line of gravity the fore feet not being any longer necessary are changed into wings which are to be formed according to the fourth rule as fowls are protected by their feathers from being teased by flies à long tail is not necessary for this short and very moveable tail is substituted to assist their flight the transformation of quadruped into the human figure plate vii fig order to avoid multiplicity of lines which would create confufion it is best to represent any quadruped upon its four feet the horse for example and afterwards to place him erect upon his hind feet the following changes will natu- rally follow the hips will be compressed into right line with the the fore feet will hang downwards close to the sides of the animal hence clavicle will become necessary the thighs and legs will now be rectilinear the head need not be placed upon long neck as the animal can not graze in this position and therefore the prominence above the shoulders or withers becomes unne- cessary the back in consequence of these alterations is flatter the brains being of larger volume and placed before each other require the head to be of rounder form and the centres of motion and of gravity must unite in the same point the maxilla being necessarily drawn inwards the nose projects beyond them the feet become shorter and terminate in five toes it follows from the third rule that the thighs and calves as well as the posteriors must be made propor- tionably thick to support the body in an erect position this has been judiciously remarked by aristotle ec homo unus cauda vacat nates habet quod nulli quadrupedum datum est crura etiam homini femore suraque carnulenta funt.— quorum causa una est omnium quod homo solus animalium erectus est itaque nates carnosas fecit et femora et furas thus gentlemen have accomplished the tafk which had imposed upon myself by pointing out to you the analogy that runs through animal nature if have not succeeded to your expectations in presenting the rules so clear and decisive as might have been wishied hope have awakened your curi- osity by having made you more acquainted with the general plan of the creator in the formation of animals and de- monstrated that minute acquaintance with this will best enable the statuary and painter to excel in the different branches of their art the end
