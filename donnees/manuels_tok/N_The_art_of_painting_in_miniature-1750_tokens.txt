preface communion with peculiar and very filial regard to the religious the whole of it would not perhaps appear very gracefully in the language of protef tant country to guard againft any offence which skilful painters might be led to take at the publication of this little affemblage of instructions it is declard that it was ot intended for them but for the tyros only and novices in the art and fuch a can not eafily be provided with maf- ter to qualify them for this charming employment and it is certain there are thoufands of perfons in great bri- sian as well as in other nations who have greater paffion for this art than they have opportunity to cultivate the country affords but few pain- ters whofe instructions are of any va. lae and good pieces of this kind are very fare among us while great num- bers of both sexes of fortune and lei- fure who with genius for painting are devoted to country-life languith away many heavy hour for want of some intelligence in this art which they might pass very agreeably with little ho pref ace little skill im ii and perhaps rural life of recess in the country can- not be sweetend by more elegant amufement the author of the following treatife has conceald his name but infinuated enough in his preface to let us know he was man of fortune who painted only for the entertainment of his friends and his private diverfion this men- tion to thew the reader that he need not be apprehenfive of that fallhood and referve we too often meet with in books fof this subject written by profess ’ pain ters hedrew up his papers of which the following are tranllation for the instruction of some perfons of quality at ga diftance from him who fucceeded fo happily in their purfust of this art by the help of them only that on their inftan- ices he refolv ’ to make them publick that every one with the leaft genius for the art of painting would find his method as plain and intelligible and reap as much benefit from his in- structions as his pupils of quality fince has begun at the very elements or of mimature and omitted not the the prefa the leaft matter or circumftance that is requifite to full and perfect elacidation of the art shall only add that the french were charm ’ with the work as foon as it was publifh ’ and made such demand for it that it quickly ran through fc veral editions and preading among their neighbours on the continent has been tranflated with great success into their respective tongues ol ainting in min.aiure not here to celebrate the prailes of painting many learned nch who have to happily treated of the dignity excellence of this charming art have faved me the labour fince what they have faid of painting in general is alfo true of miniature in particular will only add in few words the peculiaricies which diftinguish it from every other spe- cies of painting it is more delicate it requires nearer view it is not eafily done but in littls it is wrought only upon velum or paper and the colours are diluted only with gum-water to fucceed in this art man should be perfectly skilled in the art of designing or drawing but as moft people who affect the one know little or nothing of the other and would have the pleafure of painting without giving themfelves the trouble of learning to defign which is indeed an art that is not acquired without grear deal of time and continual appli- cation inventions have been found our to supply the place of it by means of which man defigns or draws without knowing how to design ii te firft is calking that is if you have mind to do print or design in miiature the back-fide of it or another paper mult be blacken ’ with small-coal and then rubb ’ very hard with the finger wrapt in linnen cloth afferwards the cloth muft be lightly drawn over the side fo blacken ’ that no black grains may remain upon it to foil the velom you would paint upon and the print or draught muft be faftened upon the velom with four pins to keep ir from shifcing and if it be ano- ther paper that is blacken ’ it muft be put between the velom and the print or draught with the blacken ’ side upon the velom then with blunced pin or nec- dle you muft pats over the principal lines of strokes of the print or draught the coniours the plans of the drapery and ovef every thing elfe that mutt be diftin- suithed prefting to hard that the strokes may be fairly marked upon the velom un derneath iii copyine by squares is another con- venient method for fuch as are but litrle skilld in the art of defigning and would copy pictures or other things that can not be calked the mechod is this the piece mult be divided into many equal parts by lirtle squares marked out with charcoal if the piece be clearand whicith and the black can be fairly feen upon it or with white chalk if it be too brown and dusky after which as many squares of equal dr- mentions mult be made on whire paper upon which the piece muft be defigned becaufe if this be done immediately upon velom as one is apt to mifcarry in the firff accempt the velom may be foiled with falfe touches but when it is nearly done upon paper it mult be calked upon the velom in the manner before defcribed when the original and the paperare thus order ’ obferve what is in each square of the piece to be difigned as head an arm hand and to forch and place it in the corresponding part of the paper and thus finding where to place all the parts of the piccs you have nothing to do but to form them well and to jon them together by this nicthod you may reduce or cularge b piece to what compats joupleafe making the squares of your paper greater or letter than thofe of the orrginal but they mutt always be of an equal number iv to copy picture or other thing in the jame size and proportion another method is to make ule of varnith ’ paper or of the skin of hog bladder very trantparent fuch as is to be had at the gold- beaters talc or kinglats will likewife do a well lay any one of thofe things upon our piece and thro it you will fee all the strokes and touches which are tobe drawn upon it with crayon or pencil then take it off and fattening it under paper or velom fet up both againtt the light in the manner of windew and with crayon or filver needle markout upon the paper or velom yon have put up- permoft all the lines and touches you shall fee drawn upon the varnished paper blad der talc or ifinglats you have made ule of and which will plainly appear thro this window after this manner making ufe of the window or of glats expoted to the light you may copy all sorts of prints defigns and other pieces on paper or velom lay ing and faftening them under the paper of velom upon which you would draw them and is very good and very eaty con trivance for doing pieces of the jame size and proportion i you have mind to make pieceslook another way there is nothing to be done but to turn them laying the printed or drawn side upon the class and faftening the paper or velom upon the back of it remembring to let your lights fall on the lek side good method likewife to take true copy of picture in oil is to give touch of the pencil upon all the principal strokes with lake tempered with oil and to clap upon the whole paper of the fame size then pafting the hand over it the touches of the lake will stick and leave the defign of your piece expreffed upon the paper which may be calked like other things but you muft remember to take off with the crum of bread what remains of the lake upon the picture before it be dry you may likewife make ule of pounce made of powder ’ charcoal put in linnen rag with which the piece you would copy muft be rubb ’ after you have prick ’ all the principal strokes or touches and faftened whice paper or velom underneath bur furer and cafier hlelp than all thefe for one who knows nothing of de figning is mathematical compals it made of cen pieces of wood in form of rulers half quarter of an inch thick half an inch broad and foot long of or more according as you have blind ro draw pieces of greater of leffer size to faciluare the conftruction of this infirument here exhibt figure of it with an ex- planation of the manner in which it is to be uied liitle beard is to be of fir and cover ’ with linnen or any other cloth becaute the piece you copy and the velom of paper you copy upon muft be fixed upon it upon this board muft the com- pals allo be fixed with large pin by the end of the firtt foor deep enough to keep it clofe but not to deep as to hunder it from turning eafily when you have mind to reduce things place your origi- hal on the side of the foorc and the ve- lom or paper you would draw upon on the side of the foor removing the velom or drawing it nearer according as you in- tend to reduce or enlarge in order to enlarge piece you have othing to do but to change the places of your original and your copy placing the latt rowards and the other on the sitle of and in both one and the other method crayon or leaden needle mult be put in the foor under which the velom lies and pin little blunted in that over the ori- ginal with which all the traces are to be followed conducting the pin with one hand and with the other preffing genely upon the crajon or needle that marks the hen the cravon or needle velons bears fufficiently upon the velom you have occafion to rouch it by this inftrument you may alfo draw in equal dimenfions but in order to this the compats mult be fixed in another manner upon the board for if it is to be faftened upon it by the middle at and your ori- ginal and your copy muft be fix ’ on each side of this middle foot at equal dillan- ces or from corner to corner that to when the pieces are large one may likewife draw feveral copies at once of equal and different dimentions vi these are all the heips can give to fuch as are not mafters of design for thofe that are they have nothing to do with them b therefore your piece is marked our upon the velom you mult pats with pencil of very clear carmine ever all the praces to the end they may not be effaced a you work then clean your velom with the crum of bread thar no black may re inain ipon it vii voux velom muft be pafted upon little plare of brats or wood of the size you weald make your piece to keep it frin and ight but this pafting muft be on the edges of your velomonly and behind the plate for which purpole your velom muft exceed yeur plate above an inch on every side for the part you paint upon mult never be pafted becaufe it would not only give it an ill look but you could not take it off if you would cur off the litle shags and locks of the velom and wer ting the fair side with linnen cloth dipt in water clap the other upon the plate with clean paper between them so much as hangs over muft be pafted upon the back of the plare drawing it equally on all sides and hard enough to ftretch it well viil the chief colours made ufe of for painting in ministure are carmine and florence lake rofe pink vermillion red lead brownred red orpiment ultramarine verditer- indigg cfall-fione vellow oker— duich pink gamboge naples vellow pale mafticot deep vellow mafticot ivory-black lamp- black true indian

which are put the colours for miniature nv.. all the colours above specified with every implement and urenfit neceffary in the prac- tice of painring in miniarure are prepared and fold at most print-shops in london and wektminfter the seven traufparent colours which are used where writingis seen thre the colour lake bine vellow liquid grass-green dark-green purple colour brown ix as i as all colours taken from earth and other heavy matter are always too coarle be they never to well ground especially for delicare work becaule of certain sand remaining in them the finell parts may be drawn out by diluting them with the finger in cup of warer when they are well steeped let them fettle while then pour out the cleareft which will be at top into another veffel this will be the finelt and mult be let dry and when tis ufed muft be dilured with gum-water as shall fhew hereaffer this is very good contrivance especially for flake-white in which there is chalky matter which like the coarfe and heavy paris in other colours finks to the bottom of the cup it is itsep ’ in ir you mix little of the gall of an ox carp or an eel particularly of the laft in green black gray yellow and brown colours it will not only take away their greaty narure but alfo give them luftre and brighinets they have not of themfelves the gall of eels mufthe taken out when they are skinn ’ and hung upon nail to dry and when you wouldufe it it muft be diluted with brandr and liitle of it mix ’ with the colour you have dilu ted already thislikewife makes the colour rick better to the velom which it hardly when it is greaty moreover this gall hunders it from fcaling kl some colours are made clearer by fire as tellow ooaker brown red ulira- marine and umber allothers are darken ’ by it but if you heat the faid colours with sharp fire they change for the brown red becomssyellow vellow ocker becomes red umber reddens alfo ceruse by fire takes the colour of citron and is often called mofficot oblerve that fellow oker heared becomes more tender than it as and foffer than brown red likewile brown red heared becomes foffer than fine vellow oaker both are very proper the finelt and cruelf uhramarine heated upon ared hot iron becomes more glittering but it waltes and is coarfer and harder to work with in miniature when tis purged after this bianner xii all thefe colours are diluced in little cups of ivory made on purpofe or in sea-fhells with water in which gum- arabic and sugar candy are put for in- hance in glats of water put piece of gum as big as walnut and half char quantity of sugar candy this laft hinders the colours from fcaling when thy are laid on which they generally do when they want it of the velom is greaty this gum-water muft be kept in neat bortle corked and never mult you take any gour of it with pencil that has colour it but with cuill or fome fuch thing some of this water is put in the shell with the colour you would temper and dilured with the finger till it be very fine if it be too hard you muft let it fokten in the shell with the faid water before you dilute it afferwards let it dry and do thus with every colour except lilly-green sap-green and gamboge which mutt be temper ’ with fair water only bur clira marine lake and biftre are to be more gumined than other colours if you make ufe of sea-shells you muft let them kleep two or three days beforehand in water then cleanfe them in boiling hor water mix ’ with vinegar in order to carry off certain salt which otherwife ricks to them and spoils the colours that are put to them kiil to know whether colours are fufficiently gumimed you have nothing to do but to give stroke of the pencil upon your iland when they are dilured which dries immediately if they chap and fcale there is too much gum if they rub out by pafting the finger over them there is too little it may be feen likewife when the colours are laid on the velom by paffing the finger over them if they flick to it like powder it is sign there is not gum enough and more muft be put in the water with which you temper them take care though you do not put too much for that makes the colour extreamly hard and dry it may be known likewife by their glewiness and brightness the more they are gum- ined the darker they paint and when you have mind to give greater strength to colour than it has of ittelf you have nothing to do but to give it great deal of gum kiv provide yourfelf with an lvory pallet very finooth as bigas your hand on one side of which the colours for the carnation of naked parts of picture are to be ranged in the following manner in the middle put great deal of white pretty largely pread becaute it is the colour moff made ufe of and upon the edge from the left to the right place the following co- lours at little diftance from the white mafticot durch pink orpiment fellow oker green composed of verditer durch pink and whire in equal quan- tities blew made of ultramarime indigo and whice to great degree of paleness ver and black on the other side of the pallet pread lorme white in the fame manner as for the carnation and when you have mind to paint draperies or other things place near the white the colour you would make em of in order to work as fhall thew hereafier xv the uufe of good pincils is great matter in order to make good choice wer them little and if the hlairs keep clofe together as you turn them upon the finger and make but one point they are good but if they clole not together but make feveral points and some are longer than others they are good for nothing not for dotting in particular and leaft of all for carnation whenthey are too tharp point- red with only fouror five ilairs longer than the reft yet clofing all together they are notwithllanding good but they muft be blunted with pair of scizzars taking care fat the same time you do not clip away too much tis proper to have two or three fors of them the largeft for laying the grounds and dead-colouring and the fnall- et for smissing to bring the hairs of your pencil tojoin clofe together and make good point you mult ofen put the pencil juft between your lips when you are ar work moiftening and prefting it clofe with the tongue even when there is colour upon it for if there be roo much some of it is taken off by this means and enough lek for giving fine and equal touches yow need not apprehend this will do you any harm none of the colours for miniature except orpiment which is poifon when they are prepared have either ill tafte or ill quality this expedient muft especially be ufed for detting and for simmshing particularly the naked parts of picture that the toucks may be neat and fair and not too much charged with colour as for draperies and other things as well in dead-colouring as in finishing is fufficient in order to make the flairs of your pencil join well and to unload it when it has too much colour to draw ir upon the edge of the shell or upon the paper you mult put upon your workcoreff your hland ofl giving fome strokes upon it before you work upon your piece xvi to work well in mmimature you mult do it in room that has but one win- dow and fix yourfelf very near it with table and desk almoft ashigh as the win dow placing your felf in fuch manner that the light may always come in on the left side and never forward of on the right xvil when you would lay colour on all parts equally firong as for ground you mult make your mixtures in shells and =put in enough for the thing you defign for if there be not enough tis great chance but the colouryon mix after- wards is too dark or too light xviil arter having spoken of velom pencils and colours let us now thew how they are to be employed in the firft place then when you would paint piece be it carnation drapery or any thing elfe you muft begin by dead-colouring that is to lay by laying your colours on with liberal strokes of the pencil in the fmoothelt man her you can as the painters do in oil not giving it all the force it is to have for fi mishing mean make the lights littie brighter and the shades lets dark than they ought to be becaufe in dotting upon them as you muft do after dead colouring the colour is always fortified and would at latt be too dark kik there are feveral ways of dof- ting and every painter has his own some make their dots perfectly round others make them little longith others baich by little strokes that cross each other every way till the work appears as if it had been wrought with ders this laft mcthod is the belt the boldell and the foonelt done wherefore advife fuch as would paint in minialure to ule it and to mure them- felves from the firft to dot in the plump and the soft way that is to fay where the dots are loft in manner in the ground upon which you work and only to much appears as is fufficient to make the work feem dot- ted the bard and the dry way is quite the reverfe and always to be avoided this is dene by dotting with colour much dar ker than your ground and when the pen- cil is nct moiften denough with the colour which makes the work feem rough and un- cvell xl srupy likewife carefully to less and drown your colcurs one in another to that if may not appear where they disjoin and to this end fokten or allay your touches with colours that partake of borh in fuch fort that it may hot appear to be your touches which cut and disjorn them by the word cut conceive what manifeftly separates and divides and does not run in and blend it felf with the neighbouring co- lours which is rarely practis ’ but upon the borders of drapery xxl when your pieces are finilk ’ to beigbten them lirde gives them fine air that is to fay to give upon the extremity of the lights fmall touches with colour yet lighter which muft be loft and drowned the reft xxii waen the colours are dry upon your pallet or in your shells in order to ute them they muft be dilured with warer and when you perceive they want gum which is seen when they cafily rub off the iland or the velom if you give touch with them upon ether as have faid alrea- dy they muft be temper ’ with gum-water inttead of pure water till they are in good condition kxiil there are feveral forts of grounds for pictures and portraitures some are dark compoted of biftre umber and cologn-earth with litde black and '' wbite others more yellow in which is mixed great deal of oker others grayer which partake of indigo in order to paint ground make wath of the colour or mixture you would have it or according to that of the picture or portranure you would copy that is to fay very light lay in which there is hardly any thing but water in order to foak the velom then pals another lay over that fomewhat thicker and ftrike it on very finoothly with large strokes as quick as you can not touching twice in the fame place before it be dry be caule the fecond stroke carries off what has been laid on at the firtt especially when you lean litle too hard upon the pencil xxiv other dark grounds are like wife made of colour little greenith and thofe are moll in ofe and the properelt to lay under all forts of figures and portraitures becaufe they make the carnation or naked parts of picture appear very fine are laid on very eafily and there is no occafion to dot them as one is often obliged to do the others which are rarely made fmooth and even at the firtt whereas in thefe one fel- dom fails of succets at the firft bour to make them you muft mix black duich pink and white all together more or lets of each colour according as you would have them darker or lighter you are to make one lay very light and then thicker as faid of the firft grounds vou may allo make them of other colours if you pleale but thefe are the moft common kxv wren you paint hloly perfon upon one of thefe grounds and would paint small cloryround the hlead of your figure you muft not lay the colour too thick in that part or you may even lay none at all especially where this clory is to be very bright burlay for the firtt time with while and lirtle oker mix ’ together of firt ficient thicknels and in proportion as you frem the place of the hlead put litrle more oker and to make it lole ir felf and dye away with the colour of the ground baich with free stroke of the pencil for lowing the round of the glory fomefunes with the colour of which it is made and fometimes with that of the ground mixing litile white or oker with the laft when it paints too dark to work with and do this till one be infentibly loft in another and othing can be seen to disjoin them xxvi to fill an entire groand with glory the brightell part is laid on with licle oker and white adding more of the firft in proportion as you come nearer the edges of the picture and when the oker is not flrong enough for you muft always paint darker and darker add gall-sone af terwards lixtle carmine and lattly biftre this firft laying or dead-colouring is to be made as foft as poffible that is to fay let thefe fhadowings lose themfelves in one and- ther without cap or interfection then the way is to dot upon them with the same colours in order to drown the whole to- gether which is pretty redious and listle ditficult especially when there are clouds of glory on the ground their lights mult be fortified in proportion as you remove from the figure and finithed as the reft by detting and rounding the clouds the bright and obicure parts of which muft run inienfibly into one another xxvii for day-ky take ullramarine and good deal of white and mix them together with this make lay as finooth as you can with large pencil and liberal strokes as for grounds applying it paler and paler as you defcend towards the hori which muft be done wich vermiltion or red lead and with white of the fame strength with that where the sky ends or tomething lels making this blew lofe it felf in the red which you bring down to the skirts of the earth or tops of floules imixing towards the end gall-stone and deal of white in fuch manner that the mixture be still paler than the former without any vifible interfection or parting between all thefe colours of the sky xxviil wen there are clouds in the sky you may spare the places where they are to be that is to lay you need not lay on any blew there but form them if they are reddith with vermillion gall-fione and white with liule indigo and if they are more upon black put in good deal of the latt painting the lights of one and the ther with mastrcot vermiltion and white more or less of any of thefe colours accord- ing to the strength you would give thenm or according to that of the orizinal you c rounding the whole as you det for tis difficuit matter to lay them very fmooth at the firlt painting and if the sky is not even enough you muft dot it alio it is at your plealure to exempt the places of the cieuds for you may lay them upon the ground of the sky heightening he bright parts by putting good deal of white and forcifying the shadows by uting iufs this is the thercelf way kkik night or fformy sky is done with indigo black and white mixed roge- ther which is laid as for day-sky to this mixture muft be added oker vermilli- on or brown-red for the clouds the lights of which are to be of mafticot or red lead and little white now redder now yel lower at difcretion and when it is tem peltuous sky and lighreningappears in some places be it

black dif appear and black brings white more into view as in the reffection of clobes of other figures to be made round where there are always parts that jy as it were from the eye and deceive is by

clearer than the ground and thofe on the other side darker the prickles which are upon the stiles and buds of rofes are done with lirtle touches of carmine which are made to go every way and for thofe that are upon the stalks they are formed with verditer and carmine and shadow ’ with carmine and biffre making the bottom of the stalks more reddish than the top that is to fay you mult mix with the green carmine and pure biftre of tulips xcvi there are an infinity of tulips different from one another one can not pretend to mention the colours with which they are all done will only touch upon the handlomelt called preaked and thefe streaks are dead -coloured with very clear carmine in fome places and with dar- ker in others finithing with the fame co- d by little strokes which mult be carried the fame way with the streaks and in others is put firtt lay of vermillion then they form them by mixing carmine and finith them with pure carmine in some they put florence-lake over the vermillion intread of carmine some are done with lake and carmine mixed together and with lake alone or with white and lake for the firtt forming whether it be rofe-pink or flerence-lake there are fome of purple colour which are formed wich ulramarine car- mine or lake fometimes blewer and fome times redder the manner of doing both one and the other is the same there is no difference but in the colours you mult in certain places as between the streaks of vermillion carmine or lake lometmes put blue made of ultramarine and white and fometmes very bright purple which is finithed by strokes as the reft and loff with the streaks there are jome likewife which have fallow teints that are made with lake biffre and oaker according as they are but this is only in fine and fare tulips and not in the common cles for thadowing the ectrom of them they erdinarily take indigo and white for fuch whole streaks are of carmine for fuch as are of lake they take black and white with which in some biffre is ixd and in others green some are likewife to be shadow ’ with gamboge and umber and always by strokes and traces that turn as the leaves turn other talips are likewile done call ’ dbor- dor ’ that is to fay the tulip isnot ftreaked but on the edges of the leaves where there is border it is white in the purple red in the vellow yellow in the red nd red in the wbite the purple is laid with ultramdrine carmine and white fhadowing and finithing it with this mixture the border is par ’ that is to fay let only light lay of white be put there and let it be shadowed with very bright indigo the fellow is

thadowed wich black blue and white indian ink is very proper for this the shadowings of it are very tender produces alone the effect of blne and whites mixed with other black the border of this whice tulip is done with carmine in all thefe sorts of tulips they leave nerve or sinew in the middle of the leaves that are brighter than the reft and the borders are drowned with the bottom by fmall traces turning crosswife for they muft not appear cut and feparated as the reaked or party-coloured they make them likewife of feveral other colours when they happen to be such whole bottoms on the

poffets alone all the parts which have given reputation to great painters every one of them had his perfection and his weakness and every one of usought to be content with his por- tion the main point is to cultivate it with care and though this little book will certainly contribure thereto yet prefent it you only as supplement to better meas with- out doubt one may learn more advanta- geoully under an excellent mafter from whom one might receive all the proper rules and fine maxims of the art and by whom one might fee them put in practice and though the contrivances for drawing which have fet down at the beginning are infallible yet tis much better to get faculry in the true and genume art of it for if you have not to lupply this defed very peculiar genuis and an extraordi- nary juftness of eye and iland draw your pieces as corretly as you may twill be ilazard bur they are spoild in the end and have neither proportion nor beanty be caufe in the application of the colour you very cafily lofe the srokes and traces and not without great difficulty can you reco- ver them if you underfland not fomething of drawing earneftly exhort therefore all lovers of painting to learn to draw cor- rectly to copy indefaugably and with the greatelt exactnels good originals in word to rife by eafy and ordinary steps to the perfection of this charming art the rules of which like all otiiers are foon learnt but that is not enough they muft be put in execution the tbeory is nfelets with the praftice and the prattice without the theory is blind gguide which leads us out of the way inflead of con ducting us whether we would go but to understand well what one would do and to do well what one underttands is the true way to do and underftand great deal in time and of good scholar to become an excellent mafter for what remains fet not up for fuch one and yer can affure fuch perfons as will take the trouble to enter into this litte school with fome inclination and apinets to

this looks affected and gives them gaudy theatrical arr ome general instructive dsci for the art of drawing he ingenious author of the preceeding little but valuable treatife has laid down feveral rules for delincating or copying pictures or prints by fuch as could not draw knowing very well that the performance of the former would be very deficient withour the practice of the latter and he recommends it as the furelt way to excel in that charming art of painting in miniature of which he has to freely and in genuoully given tuch fulland plain inftructions it is to be admired that moft perfons from their infancy have fondness for pictures and children love to buty themfelves with draw colouring and handling pencil but this fondnels for the generaliry wears off by degrees and is by moft quire neglected the chief reafon of which as prefume is the trouble and pains they apprehend will attend the acquifition thereof it is certain that every one is not endued with difpofition or natural inclination to that ingenious art hor can it be artain ’ by labour and pains without genius but such as find them felves dispoted should by all means come to refolution to attempt the practice thereof parents therefore would do well to watch and obferve diligently the inclination of their children and finding that by inflind they thew natural genims and capacity for ingenuity when of their own accord they will take delight in drawing fhadow- ing and finithing any thing they attempt to copy and feem to take pride in their performances they should by all means be encouraged and be instructed by good mafter in the beft manner in the funda- mental rules and precepts requitite to be known in the progress and practice of either drawing defigning or paumting it frequently happens that bright genius an artiff born has no opportu- nity to receive the infiructions of malter or is by diftance in the country de- prived of the converfation with artifls and ingenious practicioners his only way is then to furnith hunself with fuch books that may guide him in his purfut after thar knowledge he fo fondly arns at and for th benefit of fuch thefe leffons are inten ded not doubring they will meet with the tame encouragement and reception by the ingenious as the preceeding work viz the art of painting in mimature has done to which fourth ediion have added thefe infiructive leffons for the art of drawing as brietly plain and ealy as poffible ii uch as intend to make themfelves compleat in the art of drawing should firft learn the principles of geomerry and perspettive and thereby inform their minds of true symetry and proportion this being subject to be mer with in books wrote by skiifal arcifts for that purpofe shall for brevity sake ouut enlarging upon it the common rules for beginners are commonl to draw the particular members of the bodies of men and firtt of all the pace or head is attempted by drawing an oval or the shape of an egg with the feveral dimentions of the cross by which learner may underfland the better to ex- press the turnings and motions of the pace in the different attaudes hereafter exem- plifyed this oval for the hlead or face belong the eyes eyc-brows nofe mouth and ears and to place them in their proper situations the cross is drawn for that purpofe after you have formed an oval drawa perpendicular down the middle this cross again in the middle with diametrical line which you divide in five equal farts each being the breadch of one eye this is called the ocularline on which you place the lyes and is with the perpendicuar which gees from the top of the forehead through the middle of the nofe mourh and chin called the crofs upon which the lyes nofe mouth and ears are to be placed in their proper situations as jes may obferve in fig but for the better apprehention of fuch as are unacquainted with the ule of the crots in the oral or with the many varrations of the fame as in turnings and motions of the head an experment has been found to make the ute of the crots more plain and incelligib which is this have piece of weed turned in the shape of an egg as in fig then draw line from point to point lengthways through the bidft of the esg as in fig divide this in two equal parts by cutting right angle as you fee fis having drawn the eyes nofe mouth in their proper place you may by the pofition of the ess see the decli- of inclination of faces and according to the pofition of fig you will see it fronting turning the egg or oval alittle from the left to the right the ftraight perpendicular of the crots will change and prelent itfelf in an arch as in fig.. ac- cording to which you project the nofe beyond the round of the oval and place the reft of the members of the face in their proper lies as in fig the same be obferved in turning the figure of the oral the contrary way as in fig again the oral inclining downward the crots will appear as in fig and the face looking down as in fiz the oval being turned backwards the crots will change again as in fiz and face drawn according to thole lines will appear like fig after this manner you may form variety of faces except thofe which are fideways which are commonly drawn by means of perpendicular as you fee in fis r upon which you place the forehead nofe mouch and chin ler them be in what difpofition they will see fig are the neceffary rules for delign- ing or drawing face which if well ob- ferved and practifed will in lictle time furnith learner with lively ideas to jraw faces with good judgment and give them mafterly strokes and tonches of which otherwife by meerly drawing or copying after prints he would have been unacquaint- iii ed with ving advanced and mounted the firlt scep and the young praditioner is well grounded in drawing the oval and face he may then exercile humfeif to copp with great care and diligence after good draughts and prints the former being the molt proper for fuch as incend to exer cife the art of painting and the larter for such as propofe to practice erching of graving beginning with fuch as are caff andgeing forwards to fuch as are more dit ficult and having arrived to some perfection this he may adventure to copy affer panrings and to contract large pictures inro acall obferving due proportion and by diligent practice he will accuftom him- felf to quets well and acquire free and fure fland in defigning next to this young practitioner may venture upon copyingafter figures of plast ter of paris which is more difficult than either drawing after prints or paintings and shall be more fully treated of in its pro- per place the beft patternsto draw or copy after is life afelf or all natural things here an arrift has large field to range in and he need never be idle but may always find innumerable subjects to improve his talent which can not be better done than by dili- gence and application iv come to the practice of the artof drawing itfelf and firft of drawing after draughts prints or pictures you muft frlt of all oblerve to fix your principal in proper light to as to fee in diffind and plain placing it at proper diltance accor ding to the largeness of the picture or draught you defign to copy putting it rraight before you and not flat for then you would fee in forethorten the paper vou draw upon fix five or fix double on board holding that on your knees with which you elevate it as high as you would have it thus you will the beccer compare your draught with the principal beforeyou which otherwife in cafe your draught lay far you could not do to well thus being fixed for to begin your piece guets firft the middle of the picture or whatever you intend to copy after and make mark with your coal in the middle on your paper from this mark on will guets at the pro- per diftances of the figures difperted in the pieces if there be more than one and by taking heed of the cantal strokes with free and flight touches you will foon fee whether the poficion of your figures be jult leaving the small breakings or partings to the next drawing and thus by patience and pratice you will not only readily but alfo judicioully attain with delight to your purpofe having made rough skerch examine whether the dilpofition and actions of the figures anfwer thofe in the prici pal before you correct and amend fuch parts as you fee amiss by adding of taking off till you find it antiwer yon purpofe and having made thus rough skeich you may proceed and draw it neater and berter ob- ferving the various turnings that reprefen themielves either in the actions or drapery taking fleed not to make the firtt skerch worfe or fpoil it by being about to make it better which may loon happen if due care is not taken in preferving that difpofition you approved of before and having thus the second time drawn your sketch over with charcoal examine and correct it affer the principal and fuffer not fault to pats withour correction for it will be more for your honour to make one good draught than an hundred withour obfervation or judgment in this cafe it is proper for an arrift to divere himself between whiles by reading mulick or looking over of prints then taking freth view of his performance and examining it he may difcover fault he did not fee before ✓ drawing after figures of plaifter of paris you muft choofe proper light the room you draw in should be large and have light northwards to high that the shade which your figure makes upon the ground be equal or little lets than the height of your figure you are to draw aftet you may alfo draw conveniently by the lamp which fome artifts prefer before day-light becaufe the shades appear more rongand charp for this purpofe they hang lamp at convenient hleight well pro- vided with oil and divers wicks and to prevent the light preading itfelf too much but remain more conflant they put some oil paper through which the light can- not fhine behind it and thereby it preads the fronger upon the model they copy set yourfelf from the figure you are to draw three times as far as it is high in such manner that your eye may in rraight line behold the model hangings plumb-line before it and having drawn erpendicular line on your paper jou ob- ferve what comes either on the one side or other to your view and then make rough skerch of the pofition of the figure what in the beft manner you are able have here faid of drawing after plaifier of paris by the lamp is not to be obferved in general for as it cafts flrong and hard shades they are judged not to nacural and sweet as those caufed by the light of day and are therefore not approved of by the generality of experiencd arcifts and in cafe they do draw by the lamp they put frame with oil paper between the wio- del and the light and ther by break the harfhness of the shade yon muft fer allo whice or gray paper behind the model that you may perceive the reffexions the detter vi chas would make further progress and improvement in drawing mult ne cellarily ffudy anaromy elpecially as far relates to the mufcles an artift having the fundemental knowledge in this study will foon apprehend the regular motion of the members in the

of the breaft beginning at the nipples and ending at the small of the belly all the motions and changes of which may be obferved from the life to which refer the praltitioner but before he artempts this he will do well to draw firft after anaromical figures many of which are extant in cop- per-place prints and then after such as are call in plaifter of paris by which mcans and the reading of anatomical lectures upon the mutcles he foon will form right judgment and idea in drawing his figuies to perfection and in their regular poltures and motions vii ature or the life is compleat in all

follow the manner of their principal that in to doing they may be accuftomed to it all their life-time if you haick with pen take hleed to avoid feratching endeavour to make the strokes free and bold beginning from the fine or tharp end to the broad tome flat and equal shades muft be drawn with equal hlarches let them be fine of coarle in drawing with crayons hold your paf- tils straighe forwards and they will not fo foon become blunt for turning them be- tween your fingers they will wear and yet keep their point continually fo that you may draw whole draught without icrape- ing your paltils roulling is allo pratifed by some and differs not much from harching only to make it look clofe and blended one in and- ther it muft be dofied with some corton fixed in goofe quill when in this man- her you begin to fhadow your draught do it firft fainr finooth and even to asit may appear as if wathed with pencil then you shade your draught in the darkeft places with hatchings in graceful and mafterly manner thus by harching and dofting the one upon the other you willaccultomyour felf to mafterly iland in drawing this fort of dofling or harching is done with eitherred or black chalk inflead of cot ton some make ufe of hlair pencil that is finged blunt ar candle as much as this manner of drawing is admired by fome can not recommend it for it makes the workmanthip hard fliff and occafions breaking in the flat parts except it be in finall and curious picces the cuftom of great mafters has been to afe but one thing in their hands at once by which they have compleated ther draughts without afing cotton or the like however if one defigns to make fomerhing curious and nice the aforefaid manner of dolling will not be amiss only would not have the practtioner accuftom humfelf to it alrogether if one draws counterfeits especially upon coloured paper let him mooth the edges of the heightenings with the like coloured paper rolld up to sharp pointat one end with this joumay fweeten or foften the edges to as to appear nether t hard nor sharp there is fingular manner come artifts ufe of wallung performed with pencil dipt in ink or any other sap-colour and to pencild on all sorts of either white or coloured paper they wath therewith in any draught the principal shades and afterwards work over them flightly with pen or black chalk this is geol mafterly man g and looks exceedingly well in wathing you muft obferve to lay on firft the fofe and faint shades finoothing the edges with clean pencil moiftened little with your tongue when this is dry go over the darker shades with deeper colour thus you proceed with third and fourth shade till you fee your draught perfect always taking fieed not to make your work too hard ar firft the faint shades especially on colcured paper mult be imperceptibly lolt fince the heightening with whice will help are two proferties neceltary to be underffood in the art of drawing the one is general the other particular all composed confift of certain parts which together carry on correfpondence they make general mass or lump and are by our sight diftinguished either in general or particular if then you draw either after print picture or life ob- ferve the general form reprefented to you which confifts of feveral parts examine whether it be round quare trangular long or thort and this is bett obfervable with an half thur eye without oblerving the parts as are contained in the general for example suppofe head complearly finithed the circumferent strokes confii- ttes the general mals the eyes nofe mouth coc are the particulars contained in the general the queftion is whether this face may be known by the paris in particular or all the parts in the circumfe- tent strokes shall anfwer this with the following examples suppofe two paces be drawn with fomething that may be eafily wip ’ off very like each other wipe the circuimferent stroke of one face clean away fo that no- thing remain but the finall parts as the eyes nofe mouth c and you will pre- fently find that the likenels of the face is gone or if about thofe particular partsyon draw another circumferent line differing from the former you will behold another likenets in the face much differing from it had before by this it appears plainly that the parts themfelves do not reprefent themfelves in their being before they are jomed to their general our-ftrokes asthefe particular parts are obferved in the general of the hlead the same is to be taken nonce of in the arms hands legs and feet for although in respect to the whole body they are but parts yet in themfelves they are general to the parts they contain as the arm has its mutcles the bending of the elbow the hands have their fingers and fingers again their members and fo on in the jame manner is the knowledge of things bidden in the generalicy of all man whom we know very well be at tome reafonable diftance fo that we can not know him by some fmall parts as by his eyes whether brown or gray nether his great or fnall nofe his red of pale face nor any other fnall part of his body not withflanding we shall knowthis man at this diftance by what means by mmeans of the general for the general lump feen by you even when his eack is turned upon yeu will make you prefently know hum ei now come to fay fomeching concerning the nature and virtue of lights and shades there are no things in nature which can be diftinguished by us in leffer or further diftance from us nor can it be without exprefted by the art of drawing this knowledge for without dark and light nothing refembles what it ought to do for it is that which gives being and re prefentation to all things to prove this draw counterfeit upon white paper with black chalk when finithed it is like the perfon and judged to be well drawn here it may be asked whar correfpondence has black chalk wherewith you made your shades and the white paper by which the light is reprefented with the original that is lifer to which lantver it is not the black chalk nor the whice paper nor any fingle strokes drawn but it is the effect of the lights and shades in their proper places that reprefent life itfelf to us for it is im poffible that either round circle or spot of flat colour should reprefent globe except the roundness is given it by light and shadow xii oung pratitioners or learners should by all means ufe themfelves to the beft manner of drawing that to finith their work plain finooch near and eaty to blend the shades and lights to as to be loft the one in the other this they mult endeavour by indefaigable pains and although in the beginning it will feem dif- ficul and their performance difpleating yet let not this difcourage them from purfuing their aun for none are born mafters and he that never did do ill can not expect ever to do well one day brings on another and with it fome amendment till you arrive to perfection which will be reward for all the labour and pains you have taken in the acquifition of this charming art xiii picture or drawing that wants per- spective is looked upon as irrational and dead wherefore shall inform le practitioner what it is and how to attain the knowledge of that science fo neceflary in deligning and painting perspective is that which caulesall things contained in draught or picture to come forward or fink backward and caufes them from the firft to the laft to fland in their due and proper places as allo the vacuum or emplinels between body and body to go from you or come forward naturally to the eye as though it were acceffible and as real perspective shews the diltance which every arch or pillar has the one after the other as allo the flanding of peo- ple in their proper and fingular places fo likewife in draught or picture by the diminution of light and dark the diftance mult be obferved agreeable to the appro- priated declination and every draught or picture whether after narure or plaifter of paris you mull well obferve what appeareth forwards or backwards and how one thing follows another this is one of the moft difficult siudies belonging to the art of drawing and painting wherefore practitioner ought to inform humfelf in time either by the inttruction of maf- ter or by reading of books of perspec- tive xiv gone through the principal properties belonging to the art of drawing it will now be requifite to fum up what has been faid for making your work compleat and perfect in your rough skeich obferve to bring in good spirit free and pleating to the firtl view corred the firft rough draught in the drawing it over again and accultom yourfelf in reprefenting the shadows and touches with the coal in order to be cer- tain in the pofition of your fisures hlaving compleated your delign as far relatresto the ufe of charcoal then draw with either your pen or pencil with dili- gent care the out-lines endeavouring to keep of bring in all the beauties comeli- nets and gentiliry of the figures taking particular care and diligence to oblerve and keep the bendings and motions of the body and the eaty displaying of the folds ings of garment in their comelinels and genteel difpofition for it ofcen happens that by small bending whole part of figure is entirely spoild this is fault youth are much addicted to by obferving thofe finall bendings too much which they commonly make toobig and thereby der prive piece of that beauty which with precaution they might have preferved and this puts me in mind to caution young practnioners not to rely to much on the particulars but the general as have obferved already in the ath article for in being too attentive in finifhing and obfer- ving the little and infignificant parts you lofe that which ought to make the moft shew of amafterly performance therefore let your chicfell care be to obferve and finith the general parts to perfection for the small or particular ones may be put in afterwards with more eafe this is an article highly necelfary for young practiti- oners to be instructed in but to the shame of their teachers moft of them are kept ignorant in this particular thus some painters will take abundance of pains to draw face near at iland with all its de- formities if it has any as pits of the small pox scars spots and the like when otherwife at convenient diftance they might have the general with the particular in more agreeable appearance than it then reprefents wfelf and that with less pains and trouble but this is the cafe with many pretenders in the arr of painting that they can not draw portraiture to be any thing like except they bring in all the mlarks wrinkles c you draw withred or black chalk take hleed your strokes be not hard or too charp especially in the light parts in the frong witch ma b fhady parts you may carry bold droke always obferve that in the fhadow ing of your piece the strokes lofe and va- with away to that one might judge as if you had finithed your piece without draw- ing the circumference of our lines for thus it will be agreeable to nature where no stroke can be feen this you may ob- ferve in picture as well as in good prints of drawings it will happen that in drawing between whice and whire and againtt the light stroke or out-line muft be drawn for to exprets the draught and diftinguith ir from the ground especially when drawn on white paper but this you should endeavour to thun as much as poftible and not do it except necefficy compel you to it and you have no other means left to avord it but as cannor here fpeak of all the caufes incident to this cafe will only exemplify one for the better apprehention of young practicioners by the two faces in the op- pofite print the face as you plainly perceive is drawn compleat with an out-line stroke and the face bonly reprefents the shadows that are underneath the nofe mouth esc the queltion is whether an error is com- mitted in the face which might by the our-line of the face be amended for my part fay no but on the contrary ob ferve in the face ba fingular curioficy and beauty where whice againtt whice makes termination without circumferent stroke apprehending well this example you will improve if in your drawings and gam thereby fingular and accomplifhed man- rer what have faid on this hlead is to be obferved with due caution for as rough sketch only confifts in circumferent lines or strokes neverthelels dexterity gives it fingular beauty you may by this rule ap prehend how to work on coloured paper where by the heightnings you may do much and fave many strokes you are obliged to express on white paper xv now come to the finifhing part here you muft not childifhly or apithly imi late stroke for stroke but obferve the in rent of the mafter in his expreftions dif pofitions shades and lights in his figures if you draw face after picture of after life obferve the paftions and phi ognomy thereof take norice by what strokes touches turnings shades or otherwife fuch face is made to look forrowful or merry crying of laughing old or young wild or modeft foul or clean homely or beautiful and by obler- ving this you will not only follow the same strokes touches and shades as near to exprets the fame actions and paltions but alfo you will retain the fame in your mind and underfland it with well grounded knowledge when you begin to finith your draught take hfeed you make not the shades at firft to hard or deep as they mutt be when fi- nifhed you may eafily bring them to be darker but not to to make them lighter acquire good judgment in difpoling your shades to that they may fling things either backwards or forwards for wharever you draw with let it be redlead indian ink black chalk cec von mult exprets one extream dark or light and therefore accut- tom yourfelf from your beginning to draw to fhadow very light and fweet fame and even and bring in the perspective of dark— nets as much as poffible and by obferving this you will find yourfelf feldom deceived but gain honour and applaute by your per formance be careful to keep your draught in one even and equal condition to that it may not appear as if compoted of dark and light spots but let the lights and shades cor- respond and agree together the leffer dark with the faime and the faint with fronger lights otherwife your work will prefenrly incline to hardness and ftiffnets which if you examine life you will never meet with there whey you draw on coloured paper after print or draught obferve the even likeness of dark and light keeping the oreat parts of lights and shadows and the intermixt parts in the jame manner that the greater may always have the pre- dominancy over the lefs shall conclude with advifing young practtioners to obferve in all their perfor mances true symetry and proportion of pecially in all the parts of human figure ler them firff well be mafter of every par- ticular for it is the bc or alphabet which when well learned is cafily joined together into words and he who can de- lineare well the eyes nofe mouth ears e will readily form well proportioned face and after he has ufed himfelf to draw hands arins legs coc he will calily ccinpile whole body there are indeed feveral eminent pain ters who have in their writings endea- voured to teach young practitioners the art of true proportion and symerry by geomerrical and perspective rules how to form an ovalout of circle perpendicular into square according as the one or other object is reprefenting itfelf to ones eyes but as this way of proceeding is ve ry redious and likely to deter joung be- ginners fertil genius will like many other great mafters advance in his perfor mances by more cafier steps and form rue ided in his conception of nature welf in relation to the true symetry of the human body it is to be admired that from the dunenfion of toe or finger the whole corporeal subltance may be de- monftrated to that three sculpiors in three different places having agreed on the true meature of the heighr may work on one statue and when the limbs are brought and fixed together will make perfed lmage according to art man that is well proportioned is eight jumes as high as his head that is from the hair of his forehead to his chin his face is three nofes long and his foot is one fifth of his length ii would feem incredible to some people did their own experience not convince and latisty their curiofity without any coll or charge that thread which reaches three tames about the end of the middle finger should be juft to long as totake in the com- pats of ones wrift and that fix tinies of that length is the meafure about ones walte over the navel this may be eafily tried by winding thread fix times about the writt and then meafuring the walte thread which goes round ones fere- head will allo reach from the chin behind

have liberty to do in this what feems to him to be ufeful and agreeable tho one may at any time and in any age benefit ones felf by the sight of prints yet youth is more proper for it than any other part of man life becaufe memory is the gift of childhood and while perions are young they ought to make ufe of it as magazine to lay up things that may contribute towards forming their judg- melit if the ancients had had the fame advan- tage in this as we have and if they had by means of the prints tranfimicted what they had done that was fine and curious to pofterny we should have diftindly known
