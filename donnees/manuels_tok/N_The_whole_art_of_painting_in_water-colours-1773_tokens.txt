oyfter-shells brought to an im- palpable powder this is called pearl white an if you ufe whit vill mix well with any colour lead clarify it with white wine vinegar an after the white is fettled pour off the vinegar an it with water the method of wathing it is thus put the powder into glats of water hir it abeut and prefently pour the water off while it is white into another clean glafs and when it is fettled pour off the water and you will have an ex- cellent white to which add as much gum as is neceffary to give it gloss it has been often neticed that white lead will turn black if mixed with water that comes from iron or clay to that in the space of month of two you may perceive it and it will alfo change any colour with which it is mixed it is recommended by some to take the powder of egg-shells of the brighteft and whiteff sort let it be well ground with gum-water to the state of an impalpable powder to which you may add one twentieth part of white sugar-candy and then ufe it though others efteem it moft when clarified in spirits of wine and then ufe it with gum- water it has been found by repeated experience that this egg-fhell powder is extremely ferviceable as white in water-colours and that this and the oyfter-shell powder rectified and well bruifed will make an excellent mixture with other colours and will keep them from changing fine white for water-colours may be made by diffolving filings of silver or silver leaf in aqua fortis then evaporating the aqua fortis till it appears like chryffal in the bottom of the glals decant the other part of the aqua fortis and wath the silver four or five times in pure water till it is entirely cleaned from the aqua fortis which may be known by tafting it then dry it for ufe it muft be ufed with the waters of gum and sugar- candy make good whtte for water-colours proper for miniature take pound of the shreddings of glovers lea- ther and let them steep in water and boil them in kettle with twelve cuarts of water till it shrinks to two then ffrain it through linen cloth into well-glazed earthen pan this is called glue or size and to know if this be firong enough when it has got its confiffence feel if it is ffiff and firm under your hland the glue being made reduce fome white chalk to powder then melt the glue and while it is hot add fuch quantity of chalk as will bring it to the confiftency of pafte then letting it fteep warter of an hour ftir it with brufh for made of hog briftles then in order to make this white brighter add more glue for the firft or second lay this muft be applied by beating it with the end of bruth be careful to obferve that every layer be dry be- fore you puton another if you work upon wood you muft put on dozen but fix or feven is fuffi- cient if your paper is thick when this is done dip foft bruth in fome water then draining it with your fingers rub the work with it in order to make it the fmoother when your bruth is full of whice you muft wath it again and alfo change the water when it is too white or you may ufe wet linen rag inflead of brush of xellows in come objects there may be feen fhining like that of gold through colours of red blue or ggreen fuch as fome sort of flies or beerles and the cantharides this gold tranfparency may be very well imitated by laying fome leaf-gold on the shaded side of the drawing giving little to the light side to lay on the gold leaf press it fmooth and clofe with cotton after you have wathed it with ffrong gum-water but in this part of the performance care muft be taken that in laying on the gum you do not exceed the li- mits through which you would have the gold ap- pear in this cafe the gold is only to thine through the tranfparent colour which is to be laid over it as leaf gold will not receive water-colours re- gularly it is neceffary that the student should be prepared with water of ox-gall and with this li- quor to htroke over the ggold leaf by which means it will receive any colour you are defirous of laying over it and will alfo retain it the reds may be lake or carmine the purples lake and fine in- digo the greens verdigreafe or sap-green and for the blues indigo on the dark side and little ultramarine on the light all which colours shall be defcribed in their proper places in june and july there may be found upon rofe- trees kind of beatle of gold and crreen co- lour which may prove extremely serviceable in this kind of painting but in ufing your gold it will be beft to polish it which may be done after the follow- ing directions in some manuscripts there may be feen gold let ters which feem to rife above the surface of the paper the compofition which raifes them thus is made of vermilion and the white of an egg beat to the confiffence of an oil and then fixed to the paper with gum arabic on this figurative letter wath fome ffrong gum-water with camel ’ hair pencil then lay on the gold leaf clofe with fome cotton and when it is dry rub it with cotton and burnish it with dog' toothy and it will by this means appear as if it was really caft in gold there is alfo another way of working in gold which is performed by shell-gold but then it muft be pure and not that brought from germany which turns green in few days you muft cover the fhady parts with vermilion before you ufe this gold and when you have rectified it with spirits of wine lay it on and when dry burnith it as be- fore directed in laying on this gold it is beft to leave the lights without it as it will appear to much greater advantage than if all the object was covered but providing the whole performance should chance to be covered the beft way of fetting it off is to trace over the fhady parts with gall-ftone or the fellow made of french berries of which we shall treat hereafter and heightened with minium having treated thus much upon gold we shall ow peak of fellows in general gamboge is be- youd doubt one of the melloweff colours nature has produced it is of fo mild temperature that when it is touched with any fluid it inflantancoufty diffolves to that confequently it wants neither summing nor grinding it is productive of va riety of the moft agreeable and pleafant vellow pints that fancy or art could ever imagine it wrill generally shade itfelf though you will fome- times find in the description of flowers it requires help gall-rone is very rich deep yellow tending to wards brown it is exceeding ufeful in many lafes and the painters hold it in great effeem it reeds but little gumming or grinding it works free but will not shade itfelf we have recipe for making the following yel- low from mr. boyle who fays that if you cut the roots roots of barberries and put them into frong lixivium made of pearl—affies and water from them will proceed very agreeable vellow this experiment has often been made and as often at- tended with success he alfo gives an account of another fine trant- parent fellow made by boiling the root of mulberry-tree well cleanfed in the foregoing lixivium this will produce yellowith juice from which liquor much deeper than the former may be extracted fellow oker makes very good pale yellow and being ground with gum-water will prove ex- tremely ufeful another very ufeful vellow may be made by in- fuling the plant celandine in clear water and gently preffing it and adding to the liquor some allum- water and then let it boil the virtues of the yellow made of french ber- ries is fo well known that we need not difcourfe upon it but only give the student the following directions for preparing it quart of the preceding lixivium boil two in of french berries till the liquor is of fine fellow then ffrain it from the yellow berries and when it is cold it is fit for ufc then to the berries put pint of the fame lixivium and boil it till the liquor is as ffrong as gall-ftones with which you may shade any yellows this you may boil till it comes to brown and will with the addition of little ox-gall ferve to shade the gold leaf you may likewife make yellow by infufing saffron in pure water which produces bright rich fellow when this is ffeeped in rectified spirits of wine there is nothing higher but it is very apt to hy unless it is high gummed good yellow for the illumination of prints may be extracted from the roots of ginger which makes good green when mixed with tranfparent verdi- greafe thofe yellows called english and dutch pinks are made with french berries ground to fine pow- der and then boiled of orance colour this colour is made of mixture of vermilion and gamboge the latter moft predominant in which you are prefented with pleafant and service- able colour in painting lillies and all other orange- colour flowers what induced us to introduce this colour was to encourage thofe young beginners who may have grown weary of working in red lead that they may divert themfelves with this foft eaty and agreeable colour as they will find no difficulty in the uting it and it will reprefent the flowers in the moft lively manner imaginable of reds as minium or red lead is ftrong heavy co- jour mr. boyle has given us the following direc- sions for preparing it put four ounces of this co= your in glals to quart of rain-water and when it has been thoroughly firred pour off the water and by frequent repetition of this there vill remain at the bottom of the glass beautiful ed when it is dry which is to be ufed with crum- water when the colour has been thus prepared you muft not expect above twenty grains to remain out of four ounces carmine affords the brighteff and moft perfect crimfon and is the moft beautiful of all reds for with this colour and lake you may make the shades as frong as you pleafe but we think it neceffary to inform the student that this colour should never be purchafed but by day-light for if it is not good it will but fpoil your work lake is fine tranfparent colour not much in- ferior to carmine but in painting with carmine on that part of the print on which the light is fup- poted to ftrike you muft lay on to light tint as is fcarce vifible working it fironger as it grows darker and touch it in the darker parts with lake lake may be bought at moft colour hops ready prepared in shells for water-colours but if you are lefirous of making it yourfelf it is neceftary to ad- here to the following directions having prepared lixivium made with the afhes of vine-tvigs to three pints of it add pound of he beft ground brazil wood and boil it till half he lixivium is evaporated and then ftrain it off which being done boil it again with the addition of our ounces of freth brazil wood two ounces of cochineal half an ounce of terra marita and of fair water and let it evaporate as before then add half an ounce of calcined allum re- luced to an impalpable powder and quarter of drachim of arfenic diffolve them in it by ffirring with stick and when it is fettled ftrain it off to give this body reduce two cuttle-fith bones powder and putting it in let it dry leifurely then grind it in quanrity of fair water in which you may let it ffeep then ftraining it through cloth and making it into few cakes fet it by or vfe after drying it on piece of marble if you would have this lake redder add fome of he juice of lemon and to make it deeper add dil of tartar another lake may be made in the following man- her boil the shreds of fuperfine scarlet cloth in made of the afhes of burnt tartar and when it has fufficiently boiled add fome cochineal pow- dered maftich and roch—allum and then boil this composition again and while it is quite het ftrain imes the firft time the it thro bag feveral bag muft be ffrained from top to bottom and the remaining grofs matter being taken out let the bap be well wathed after this ftrain the liquor thro the bag again and you will find pafte remaining on the sides which you may divide into fmall cakes and fet it by for ufe to make another lake steep four ounces of the beft brazil wood in pint and half of the fineft diftilled vinegar for three weeks at leall tho the longer it remains the better it is after which feethe the whole in balneum marie till it boils up three or four times then let it fettle for day or two after which put to it an ounce of powdered allum and put it into clean pan with the liquor and let it remain fo for twenty-four hours then heat the com- pofition and fir it till it is cold and when it has food about twelve hours frain it and add two cuttle-fith bones prepared as before but liquid colour of very good crimfon may be made as follows in twelve ounces of pale ffale beer boil one ounce of ground brazil wood which may be had at moft druggifts till the colour is as frong as you defire then ftrain it thro linen cloth and bottle it up for ufe if you want to bring this colour to body take fome dried ox blood reduced to powder and mix it with the colour we have the following directions from mr. boyle for extracting fine crimfon from the berry-bearing spinach which being preffed affords very agree- able i juice to which add fourth part of allum doil it and when it is cold it is fit for ufe or you may extract very beautiful red from the red beat-root baked with little ffrong vine- gar and allum and when it is cold it is fit for ife another way to make crimfon put twenty or more grains of bruifed cochineal into gallipot with as many drops of the ley of tartar as will make it give forth its colour and then immediately add to this mixture about half spoonful of water or more and you will have very agreeable purple then reducing fome allum to very fine powder put it to the purple liquor and you will have as beautiful crimfon ftrain it thro fine cloth and ufe it as foon as poffible for tho this is colour which if foon ufed looks extremely well yer by long flanding is subject to decay of purples in general to extratt purple from legweed take of logwood eight ounces to which add pint of rain-water and an ounce of allum and let it be well infufed over flow fire in well-glazed pan or pipkin for about twenty-four hours then add to it quarter of an ounce of cum arabic let it fand for week and ffrain it thro piece of fine cloth keep it clofe or it will mould or vou may make redder purple by adding to one ounce of the above four ounces of brazil wood and pint of htale beer and boiling it till the liquer is as ftrong as you defire it may be made darker by adding more logwood tho the richeft purple is made by blending car- mine and pruffian blue or indico to what shade you pleafe of bives the ultramarine is the beft and brighteff blue we shall begin with its temperature the method of preparing it is by divefting the lapis lazuli of its gold and reducing it to the state of an impalpable powder which muft be done as follows heat fix ounces of the lapis lazuli till it is red cool it in rrong vinegar and grind it with stone and mul- ler prepared for that purpofe then make com- poficion of bees-wax rofin linfeed oil and purpentine of each three ounces incorporate the whole together over flow fire till it is near boil- ing and then pour them into pan well glazed this is called the pafte of uultramarine the lapis tuantity lazuli being prepared add to it an equal of the paftil or pafte mix them together thorough- ly and let them remain twelve hours and to ex tract the ultramarine from the pafte pour clear water upon it and prefting the pafte with your hands the uultramarine will come out for the re- ception of which place glass tumbler or what you chufe under your hland and let it fettle in this water till the ultramarine finks to the bottom if your colour feems foul you may cleanfe it thus diffolve fome tartar in water and add as much of it to the ultramarine as will cover it in which let it fland for twelve hours then wath it in warm water and you will have your colour well clarified and perfectly clean let your ultramarine be of high colour and care muft be taken that it be well ground next to ultramarine in beauty is pruffian blue when ufed in oil tho it will not sand fo long on account of its not having the body of the ultramarine the pruffian blue does hot grind kindly with water on account of its oily subftance blue bice is colour of very good body and fows very agreeably in the pencil but it muft be wathed according to the rules laid down for ui- framarine blue verditer is very bright pleafant blue of good body and works very well when ground with gum-water it is little inclinable to green and makes very good one when ground with gamboge or french berries this blue is moftly ufed for sky or garment saunders blue is extremely serviceable in the shad- ing of ultramarine where no very dark shades ap- pear which when they do you may add little indigo to it the lirmas is very agreeable blue and may be had at moft druggifts the following direction for preparing it we have of mrs. mariana as it can not be bought ready prepared for water- colours take quart of small beer wort in which boil two ounces of litmus till the colour is as flrong as you require then pour the liquor into glazed pipkin and it will foon congeal indigo is the darkeft blue is foft free colour and runs very warm in the pencil it requires to be well wathed and ground and may be made darker or lighter by the addirion of more or less gum-water care is required in the ufing this colour for as we before hinted its running to free may be means of deceiving the student and it may prove too dark for the completion of his defires mr. boyle has given us the following directions for making very fine colour of the blue leaves of rue by preffing and bruifing the leaves and in fufing both leaves and juice in pure water for about fortnight wathing them every day and then incorporate them and the warer till they be- come pulp and let them dry gradually thele will produce an excellent blue for shadine has good body and runs free in the pencil with this you should mix the powder of crum arabic which will be means of making it keep and add of the gum as much as you would have it more of lefs ffiff in working fine tranfparent blue from the preceding author equal to tint of uultramarine.—the flower from which this blue is chieffy extracted is the cyanus or blue cornbottle which is poffeffed of two blues in the outer and inner leaves the firft of which is light the other dark and is held in preference which should be picked from the but- tons and cafes in which they grow as alfo from the outer leaves the fame day they were gathered thefe middle having prepared quantity of leaves prefs out as much juice as poffible and with the addition of little allum you will be poffeffed of fine durable tranfparent blue little inferior to ultramarine the procuring of the flowers and the preffure of the juice should be done with all poffible expedi- tion left the flowers should lofe of their perfection it has been thought by fome that if the leaves of thefe flowers were cured as thofe of saffron there would proceed from them much greater quantity of colour from which might be preffed more tincture than when freth from the field in the curing of which it would appear that each time the cake was turned the flowers would be darker till they became dark blue great care is required during this operation that the fire be kept very conftant and gentle that the flowers may not be fcorched which will be an inconteftable way of bringing the flowers to perfection therefore to put this operation in execution muft be procured as for curing saffron the top of which is to be covered with hair cloth upon this lay feveral sheets of paper afterwards parcel of the inner leaves of the flower two or three inches thick prefting them clofe and sprinkle- ing them with gum water after which small charcoal fire muft be made in the kiln to as to communicate heat to the top then cover the cake with few sheets of paper and board with fmall weight upon it then after few minutes the cake is to be turned and when it is placed take off the upper papers and fprinkle the cake again with grum-water and then lay on the board weight as before for few minutes and to re- peat the turning and sprinkling feveral times till the cake is united and of the thickness of cake of saffron for further particulars which we think neceltary we refer our readers to treatife on curing saffron made public by mr. bradly in his monthly account of hufbandry and gardening of blaces the proper blacks for water-colours are as fol- low ivory black which is to be prepared in the following manner let the lvory black be tho- roughly ground and there will proceed from it liquor of an oily substance mix as much of which in the lvory black as will make it work freely in the pencil it has fine crlofs and is extremely serviceable in painting of fhining objects there is another very agreeable and ufeful black called keating black and may be had at most co- four-fhops ready prepared for water-colours indian ink is very good black and of great service as it may be laid on to any shade and will hade itfelf on which account it is often ufed for drawings of greens sap-green is colour extremely serviceable and is the beft green for water-colours our age affords it being of fo gummy subftance is great re- commendation and its dilating fo eafily in water besides this produces an infinite variety of tints and has the advantage of fhading itfelf in the purcha fing this colour remember to obferve that it looks very black and bright sea or artificial green may be made by mixss ing indigo and sap-green which may be made darker or lighter by adding more or less indigo it is very serviceable colour very eafily worked and is productive of many tints let your judgment direct you to fuch as are neceffary in your perform- ance this colour as well as sap-green shades itfelf be careful that your indigo is well ground before you mix it another may be made with indigo and gamboge well ground together and is extremely ufeful in painting of trees grafs vegetables and with the addition of sap-green is very ferviceable in flowers and shading of garments tranfparent green is made by mixing verdi- greafe and yellow to various tints by leaving either predominant of browns biffre is very good and ferviceable colour but the good sort is difficult to be found the beft being very bright and clofe and as it is colour difficult to work of itfelf it will be better to mix little spa- rish nith liquorice with it as that will mellow and take off its harthness it requires good deal of grind- ing and the higher it is gummed the better it is for ofe spanish lignorice is allowed by the beft mafters to be productive of great variety of brown tints of very agreeable colour but will not do for fhading itfelf it works as free as any gum colours and by dilaring in fair water is fit for ufc brown mixture may be made by incorporating sap-green and carmine which is remarkable for being of an extraordinary foft nature it is co- four that is extremely ferviceable as you will find hereafter in description of painting flowers in water-colours another may be made by blending vermilion and biftre thoroughly the biftre muft be extremely well ground before you incorporate it with the vermition and it will produce you brown worthy of your efieem directions for preparing the following mixed colours colour cerufe

paper to lay your iland upon as well as try your colours alfo large brush called pitch to wipe off the duff from the colours being prepared according to the foregoing me- thod proceed in your painting which if it should be landfcape you muft at firtt lay dead colours all leaving no part uncovered and in ver your piece this part of the performance there needs no great pains but mafterly freedom is rather required and the work tho feemingly rough upon clofe inspection will have good effect when placed at diftance let not the roughness of the work difcourage you nor be any means of flopping your progrefs for it is cafily to be foftened by degrees with the other sha- dows obferving only to fweeten and mellow them and heighten them as the light falls in some placeslay on ftrong and mafterly

eic in painting of trees having firft laid verdi- greafe green for dead colour proceed with work- ing it to as to give leaty appearance and feem to hang free and natural especially towards the edges where you thay-touch few leaves clofe to the tree which will give your performance mafterly eeffect and you may alfo bring fome of your leaves forward with mafficot and white and for the trunk or body work up the brown with sap- green and if you fhould introduce any oak trees in your defign you should lay on some touches to express leaves of ivy twined about it all diffant objects are to be made imperfect as they appear to the eyc thefe rules are adapted to general appearances but the student may deviate from them as nature and his own ripened judgment shall dictate the method of colouring daked figures we shall begin firft with the naked figures of women and children and though the life is to be principally followed yet we think it necefiary to give some few directions to prepare thofe colours seen in nature take flake white and little lake blend them together and with that lay- the ground colour then proceed to shade with red oker cherry-ftone black and little lake mixed toger ther touching the lips checks cc with fint of carmine and heighten it with white and little carmine remember that you are never to heighten it with pure white which will rather give it the appearance of fith than flells for old women take vermilion white and brown oker for the ground colour and shade it with red oker and cherry-ftone black and to put little bloom in their faces ufe lake and vers milion heightened as before loung women and children deceafed should be coloured with brown white and little vermis lion shaded with cherry-fione black but to old women you muft add more brown oker fhaded as before in the colouring of young men you muft add more brown oker and shade them with kearing black and brown oker touching their lips and cheeks with carmine and lake for dead men take brown with little white and vermilion and shade it with black colour halk after the most approved methods loung women and children lay on brown oker alone and heighten it with mafficot or brown oker

very ffrong co- lour but you should make three different shades at leaft by the addition of more or lets white ninth red cut rofe-pink into the shape of crayons and they will be fit for ufe without any farther preparations carmine will come very ex= penfive as shilling'-worth will make but very little crayon blues firft blue take blue bice and grind it with pure water with stone and muller and when it is dry reduce it to powder again and add to it white chalk finely powdered divide them into afcels and put to them more or lefs chalk fo as to produce various shades bring thefe to the con- fiftency of pafte with ale wort mixed with little size made according to the former directions and to proceed with making them into crayons second blue blue bice alone finely ground and prepared as the preceding third blue grind some verditer with water upon stone and then let it dry after which beat it into powder fo fine as that no lumps can be feen then divide if into four or five parcels to all of which except one add fuch different propor- tions of white chalk as will make them shades for each other make thefe into pafte with ale wort wherein gum dragon has been diffolved and that blue with which no white has been mixed make into paffe with pale ale wort and little size and to into paffils or crayons as before fourth blue take fome pruffian blue and be very careful that it is thoroughl ground and then make f it into pafte with pale ale wort-boiled and thickened with size and fo into crayons in purfuance of the firft directions then to make tome lighter shades take some more of the pruffian blue and after you have ground it well by itfelf and dried it divide it into two or three parcels to each of which add white chalk in proportion as you would have your shades lighter or darker make thefe into pafte with ale wort boiled and to into crayons as the former fifth bluc take some of the beft rock indigo and grind it with your stone and muller in pure water dry it then reduce it to very fine powder and divide it into feveral parcels to which add whice chalk in different proportions mix thefe with pale ale wort boiled and have at leaft four shades of them and for the darkeft ufe indigo made into pafte as the reft and to into paltils according to the firft directions purples firft purple take rofe pink and grind it as fine as poffible and when dry powder it and mix it well with little saunders blue till it appears of the colour you defire then bring it to pafte and fo froceed as the former second purple take lake finely ground and wathed add to it as much blue bice as will make it of an agreeable reddith purple and make this of two or three different degrees each lighter than the other and into the lighter parts put white chalk or grounds of the beft white starch and make them into pafte with ale wort boiled and mixed with size and make them into paftils or crayons as the laft third purple grind fome lake with pure and add as much pruffian blue to it as will make it of the purple you defire mix thefe well together in feveral parcels making fome more in- clining to blue others to red and to the fainteff add as much white chalk as you fee neceffary and make the feparate parcels into pafte with ale wort boiled till it becomes glucinous and make them into paftils in the fame manner as the former blaces firff black the black which is generally ufed for crayons is charcoal cut into pieces about two inches long and quarter of an inch wide the foffeft and beft are thofe made of willows you should have of thefe at leaff one dozen becaufe the contrafts black and white are moft wanted second black grind lvory black as fine pof- fible with pure water adding to it in the grinding small quantity of indigo which will very much en- liven the black and relieve it from that deadnefs which attends it when ufed by irfelf make it into pafte with boiled ale wort and fo into paftils or crayons as before browns firft brown take fome fullers earth of the bett and pureft sort and after you have ground it well with water add to it fome ground chalk in different quantities that may have three or four dif- ferent shades mix each of thefe up with pale ale wort boiled till it become glatinous and when it is half dry cut it into pieces about two inches long and quarter of an inch thick and then roll it into crayons second brown take some spanith brown grind it well with water to which add in the grind- ing fome fullers earth which will very much en- lighten it the spanish brown being of itfelf very dark colour this being done when dry beat it into powder again and divide it into four different parcels to three of which put rounds of starch in different degrees fo that you may preserve feveral shades of colour mix each of thefe feparately into pafte with little size of kinglass or pale ale wort boiled or thick water-cruel wherein gum dragon has been diffolved and to make it into paf- tils or crayons according to the former directions third brown take some indian red and spa- nith brown and grind them together with your stone and muller and mix them with ale wort till they are as fliff as pafte of this colour you may make different shades by adding more of lefs white which may be either of the aforementioned colours greens firff green provide yourfelf with some diffilled verdigreafe and grind it with ffrong vinegar with and muller after which wath it well with water the manner of which is as follows pat the verdigreafe into water and let it remain there about minute then pour the water off into cup and let it fettle then pour that from it and wath it again in the same manner and when it is dry make it into paffils of different shades with ground white chalk second green take some of the beft verdi- greafe and boil it with fharp vinegar and while it is boiling add to it little powdered tartar which being of fo sharp nature will foon diffolve the ver= digreafe and you will have the liquor of very fine colour forewhat inclinable to blue then fet the liquor in small gallipots and let it be expofed to the airy and it will foon be congealed and become hard then mix it with as much ale wort as will bring it to paffe and fo into paftils or crayons as before directed third green prepare verdigreafe after the same manner as the laft then reduce it and divide it into feveral parcels to which add pruffian blue in different proportions as you would have them lighter or darker and to the lighteff parts add little white chalk or little straw colour to variegate the shades as much as poffible mix all thefe with pale ale wort boiled as before directed fourth green grind fome blue bice very fine and in the grinding add to it fome of the beft durch pink divide them into feveral parts and make them into different shades with white chalk bring them to pafte with ale wort boiled and fo into paftils fifth green grindfome rock indigo very finewith pure water with stone and muller and after you have dried it reduce it to powder and divide it into four parcels at leaft and add to some durch pink to others dutch pink and brimffone and for the lighteff flour of brimffone only after you have made as many shades as you defire bring them into paffe with pale ale wort mixed with size made according to that receipt prefcribed at the end of the directions for painting in water-colours and then cut them into lengths and roll them into paf- tils or cravons as at firft directed sixth green grind rock indioo with water pon yourstone then divide it into parcels more or less as you think proper and add dutch pink in fuch different quantities as will produce feveral shades after thefe are well incorporated make them into pafte with boiled ale wort and roll them into paftils according to the former directions the artiff will find thefe crayons far preferable to thofe generally bought at shops and for this reafon they being frequently tempered to high with gum- water rendersthem fo fliff and obdurate that they will too often rather fcratch than give any appearance of colour upon your paper on the contrary thofe which we have here recommended may be ufed with all the eafe and freedom imaginable and will ex- press the diverfity of colours as pleafantly and agree- able as can be defired when the student is defirous of making draw- ing in crayons either from nature or from cor- reet imitation of nature he should be caseful before he begins that he has every colour that is in his original as he can not here as in painting either in water er oil colours prepare colour at warning which confideration it was that induced us to direct to many shades to be made from each colour the arciff in order to keep his colour feparate for if they mix it will on account of their soft- ness be very prejudicial to them should be prepared with box which contains as many partitions as will keep each shade by itfelf
