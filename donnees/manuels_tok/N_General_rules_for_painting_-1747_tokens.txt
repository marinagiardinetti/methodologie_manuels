in ii cerious art of painting in oil and water-colours has ever been admired and approved as mafterpiece of other arts and sciences wherein art fo exactly imi- tates nature that motion only feems to be wanting and many fuch rare pieces have been painted in both ways oil and water-colours that they have at the firft blush deceived the eyes of the curious who have taken them for real living beings and tho the eye and hafnd are mainly required herein the one to direct and the other to operate yet the mind or imaginatiopn muft furnifh cut great of the curiofity having ideas or the true shape of things always in readinets this can not be dene haftily but muft be done by fteady prac tice and curious obfervations and in this under taking for painting in oil is to prepare yourfelf with fuirable materials in the firft place you muft take care to get good pencils of all sizes preportionable to your work pallet or board to lay your colcurs on whilft you are ufing them an eafle to place yeur cloth fain ’ upon frame on or againft mcll- rick or stay made of weod not subject to hend pain tin about fard long at one end tye ball of cottofs with leather over it fo that with your left hand holding it againf the work you may fupport your right arm with it whilft you are working the next thing to be confidered to the cloth and the outlihe drawn thereon is the preparing your colours which in oil-painting muft be with linfeed- oil unless for linen and then walnut-oil is great deal better for it will not turn yellow as the other in time will when mixed with curious whites you muft grind your colours on stone with muller ill they are as fine as butter or you may have them in bladders at the colour-shops atid fome you mix an your pallet with your pallet-knife never put on your pallet more than you think you shall ufe for they will ikin over and poil which might be pre- vented by putting them under water to clean your pencils dip them in oil of turpentine and fqueeze them between your fingers in tin pan made for that purpofe where you generally lay them and your colours that are in bladders the colours are in number seven viz whire black red green fellow blue and brown the whites white lead and flake white the blacks sea- cole black ivory elack lamp-black and eorth of collen the reds red lead vermilion lake indian red and ornatto the greens terveret verditer and verdegrife the yellows apruce oaker pink or fiment and mallicot the blucs shmait and ultramarine the erowns umber spa- ish brown burnt oker thefe are the chief to be laid in oil but lvory spruce oker and umber muft be burnt before they are ground and as fir malticor vermilion ultrantarine stialt erpiment you may temper them on your pallet without grind ing bur for the mixing and tempering your co- lours to make violet take iudico whice lead and lake mix them well and thhe more or lets of each quantity will make the colour deeper or lighter to make lead colour aac of white and indico pain tin to make scarlet take lake red lead and fmall quantity of vermilion to make flame colour take red lead and mafticot heightened with white to make light green take pink and smalt as you fee occafion lighten it with white to make pur- ple take spanmh brown indico and white to make bay colour mix spanish brown and white to make murry colour mix lake and white and fo by often tempering colours and practice you may find out thouland tints but in the ufing them be cautious of taking too much oil for which reafon thofe who would have their pieces keep freth make ufe of as little oil can and keep their colours the firmer by mix ing with them little oil of spike which foon eva porates but ferve to make them run the berter and renders them the more pliable in working ano ther caufe of colours lofing their beauty is when the painter works them too much in mixing them for being jumbled together they change and corrupt one another and take away the vivacity therefore you muft be careful to ufe them properly and lay the colours each in its place without mingling them too much with the pencil or bruth alfo not to temper adverfe colours together as blacks with others par- ticularly smoke-blacks but to ufe them apart as much as poffible and when you would give the more force to your work you should stay till it is dry to touch it over again with colours that will not kill the firft laid on in the mean time they ought to learn and qualify themfelves with the proportions and connection of the part of drawing as well as the colouring and how to fix the sketches or out-lines and often to view and examine exquifite originals and all the infenfibilities and sweetneffes of the art which you will artain by viewing the works of the kilful mafters rather than by practice alone after you have done some part of your piece fet it by for fome time without looking on it then view it again by which means you may chance to difcover fome faults of pain ti.. errors or excellencies of your work which you may either mend avoid or advance according to your skill and difcretion it will be in vain for you concinually to pore over your work and dull your genius in fpite of nature and your prefent inclination general rules for painting in wa col our choofe thofe subjects that are noble and beau- tiful even in the atmoff degree of perfection that have fomething of magnanimity and greatness in them is the true characteriffick of painter and whofe sketches or out-lines are noble which will be diftinguith ’ pure and without alteration clean and united together compos ’ of great parts yet thofe but few in number and diftinguithd by bold co- fours and fuch as are related and are harmonious to each other to fucceed well in your attempts this way you should know how to draw very well the colours us ’ in water are carmine ultramarine lakes of all sorts vermilion brewn red mafticot fellow and pale indico ivory black lamp-black spanise brown umber gall-stene brown french pink orpiment gamboge neples vellow bladder- ggreen verditer sea-green flake-white thefe colours are tempered in sea-shells or in mall lvory cups made on purpofe with water in which hath been before diffolv ’ cum hrabick and sugar- candy for example in gill of water put the quantity of the top of yeur humb of gum-ara- bick and half that quanticy of sugar-candy this faft prevents the colours from fealing when dry which they commonly do without it and when the vellum paper are greaty mix little of the gall of an ox carp or eel especially of this laft it will give them lutre and vivaciry not natural to them if yeu ufe sea-shells you muft firff foak them for twis c pa in in or three days in water then clean them well in hor water to clear them of certain salt which poils the colours when you have done this pour cum- water into the shell together with the colour you ufe and temper them with your finger till the whole be very fine if you find your colour too hard leave it to foften in the shell before you mix it then when mix ’ fet it to dry and to do by all except the iris-green and sap-green and gamboge which muft be tempered with water only but ultramarine lake and spanish brown muft be more gummed than other colours to underfland when your co- lours are fufficiently gummed you need only make stroke with your tempered colours upon your hand which will immediately dry if they break and fcale they are too much gumm ’ and if they rub off by paffing your finger acrots them they are not gumm ’ enough take care alfo that you put not in too much for it will have an hard and effect your colours will be glutinous and stick ing good pencils are of great importance to the work to choofe which wet them little and twirl them on your finger if they keep their point they are good but if they break into many points of dif- ferent lengths they are good for nothing when tey are too tharp-pointed with only four or five hairs sticking out beyend the reft you may blunt them carefully with pair of sciffers or lighted candle it will be proper to have variety of sizes having poken of colours and pencils shall next shew how they are to be ufed firft of all if you would paint flethor drapery or aught elfe you muft begin by skerching or drawing with large bold yet clear strokes endeavour alfo to drown your colours into each other that no line of separation may be feen between them and foften your strokes with the colour on each hand of them fo as to be equally blended with and confounded into each other some plices are touch ’ all over alike yet foas when it is finished you may perceive the vellum paper coc in pa in in in feveral places quite through the work which is indeed too flight way and should rather be called wathing than painting the beft way is as follows lay full flat ground all over where your fleth or drapery gc are to be of the colour you defign it which being done you will find much eafier to be wrought upon and may be either heightened or deepened at pleafure take special care that when you temper or mix your colours with pure water and when you perceive they have loft their gum by often putting water therein you temper with gum water till you find they are in good order again for either complexion or garment that you mix them well with your finger and not let them be too aterith likewife preferve all your colours from duft in landlkips it is impoftible to exprets the various examples they are innumerable being as many as there are painters and fancies therefore not to be comprifed within rules but for the gene- ral obferve thefe which follow always begin with the sky sunbeams or lighteff parts firft next thofe beams that are yellowith next the blueness of the sky work your sky downwards towards the horizon fainter and fainter as it draws nearer and nearer the earth except in the tempeftuous skies work the tops of moun- tains far remote to faint that they may appear loft in the air makelow places and fuch as are near the round of the colour of the earth of dark- yellowith brown or green the next to them of light green and fo fucceffively as they lofe in di- ftance make them abate in colour do not make any thing that appears at diftance perfect by ex- preffing any particular signs or tokens that it has but express it as weakly and faintly as it appears to the eye always place light againft dark and dark againt light by which means you may extend the prospect as if very far off let all the shadowslofe their force as they remove from the eye always making the grongeff shadows neareft to hand you need of paint inc. need not be over-curious in the firft working but rather ain at good free and bold lmitation of nature than an extreme neat fet or silf way be not difecuraged it the roughness of your colour for you may work that down and touch it by de- grees with the other shadows tho you do not do it at the firft after this weeten and heighten your shadows by degrees according as the light falls then touch it in fome places with arong touches and bring your werk up together in thefe places io equal roundness and strength not finifhing any part before the others but viewing and working all the parts curioutly ke as if all the picture was painted at once take notice that skies water trees plants flowers and ground are all to be finithd before the fizures thefe inftructions laid down may be of particular efe when you work after frints where you have nothing before you but black and white but there is this difference between painting in water and in oil that in the laft the colours are taken off from the pallet juft as they appear to you to that in this cafe you have nothing to confult but tuch light and fuch chade now it is fer from being the fame in water-colours where often it hap- pens thit the laft colcuring you lay on does not pre- ferve iis colour but partakes of the colour beneath or rather the one and the other compofe new one to form the efleit you aim at for alino it be white green carmine blue orpinent befter and the like which form yeaur colouring they nevers thelefs would not produce it if you mix them toge ther for it is by proceeding from one to ine other that you can fuccced and wheti you copy picture of this kind you muft take your own tate to pro- duce the effect without having feen how it is done you muft be conjurer at leaft to quets at the order and method it was done in and take this obfervy- tion by the way that water-colours always dry lighter than when laid on and oil darker in fome ways of painting in water you have no lfe of white to otmee prints white colour but make the ground of the vellum or paper oc ferve to raife their figures in which cafe the lights appear bright in proportion to the depth and strength of the colours of the figures or you may before you go to werk give the vellum paper coc light wath with white lead weil pre- pared and purified which has pretty effect by reafon of the white running up in working which foftens the shadows and makes them look pleafing to lay on meztitinto prints on glass undertaking this curioutly lay the prints hat- in warm water of the fineft and thineff paper for that which is rough and thick will not do near to well if at all let them foak well and your glats the beft white flint go over it with venice turpentine pread thin with pliable knife and dab it over with your

unlefs bought colour ’ but in order to prepare the prints if they will not bear the colour do them over with fome thin starch which will take off the greafinets of the printing and make the colours run fmooth in colouring you muft be sure to leave the lights which has two advantages viz if the lights be left on this occafion the whiteness of the paper ferves inflead of the fe of white paint which is very heavy colour and if not finely prepar ’ will turn black and would rather confound thote that have been prescribed to be laid on than do them any ser- vice but the colours as will be directed where there is no white laid on will thine agreeably into the whice of the paper am more particular in this becaufe fome perfons will lay ablue flower all over with one colour tho' it be thick enough to hide both the light and the shades of the print and then it will look like peny picture where there is nothing but jumble of reds blues and greens but this avoid and be fure you leave your lights broad and frumble the lights into the shades of every colour but leave the middle of the lights open on the papers for as the paper is white of itfelf it makes beautiful hleightening and roundness in painting the leaves of trees plants and iferbs regard muft be had to the colour of the greens that fomerimes being the chief distinguishing character to know them by if the centre of flowers is rifing you muft teuch the edges of the lights with thin tincline ann in of of gamboge and lay on some durch pink or gall-stone over the shades fo as to run into the lights very little this is to be done becaute the thrums in the middle of flowers are generally yellow but if of any other colour as fometimes blue coc fometimes ligater and fomerimes darker then touch the verges of the lights with little ultramarine blue and over the shades either fome london blue to run little into the ultramarine or elfe shade with indico and fome of the white of the print being left void of colours will then give life and spirit to the colours fo difpos ’ all flowers should be tenderly touch ’ in the lights juft to give little glare into the light parts of the colour of the print and on the shadow-fide you multlay on ftronger colour that will force the reft to appear forward but do not daub over the shades with too heavy colour let it be fuch as may be tranfparent it poffible and foften into it the light colour that was laid on before on this occa- fion the pencil muft be us ’ but lightly with very little gum-water in it and it muft be us ’ before the colours are quite dry in greens verdegrife is the lighteft therefore that colour should be touch ’ into the lighteft parts of all greens from the place where the lighteft part of the shade ends and then on the fhadyparts lay on fome sap-green fo as to unite with the verdegrife-green and if the natural leaf should be of darkifh colour touch the lighter sides of the leaves with liftle verdegrife-green and durch yellow pink mix ’ together or with tineture of french berries but to as to let the verdegrife fhirne more than the pink becaufe it is an eafy matter to darken light colour but difficult to lighten deep one and
