written in the romiss commu- communion with peculiar and ve filial regard to the religzous the whe of it would not perhaps appear ve gracefully in the language of protel tant country to guard against any offence whic skilful painters might be led to take the publication of this little assemblag of instructions it is declar that it wi not intended for them but for the tyro only and novices in the art and suc as can not easily be provided with ma- ter to qualify them for this charmin employment and it is certain ther are thousands of persons in great bri tian as well as in other nations wha have greater passion for this ar than they have opportunity to cultivat it the country affords but few pain ters whose instructions are of any va lue and good pieces of this kind art very rare among us while great num bers of both sexes of fortune and lei sure who with genius for painting are devoted to country-life languist away many heavy hour for want some intelligence in this art whicl they

ugh in his preface to let us know he man of fortune who painted ly for the entertainment ofhis friends 'his private diversion this men- to shew the reader that hé need be apprehensive of that falshood and serve we too often meet with in books this subject written by professd pain- hedrew up his papers of which following are translation for the struction of some persons of quality at listance from him who succeeded so pily in their pursuit of this art by the elp of them only that on their instan- he resolv to make them publick ping that every one with the least enius for the art of painting would ud his method as plain and intelligible reap as mnch benefit from his in- uctions as his pupils of quality since has begun at the very elements or of mintature and omitted not the ne least matter or circumstance thai requisite to full and perfect elucidati of the art isnall only add that the french charm ’ with the work as soon as was publisn ’ and made such dema for it that it quickly ran through veral editions and spreading amo their neighbours on the continent been translated with great success ii their respective tongues the art of painting in miniature undertake not here to celebrate the praises of painting many learned men who have so happily treated of the dignity and excellence of this charming art have saved me the labour since what they have said of painting in general is also true of miniature in particular will only add in few words the peculiarities which distinguish it from every other spe- cies of painting it is more delicate it requires à nearer viety it is not easily done but in little it is wrought only upon velum or paper and the coiours are diluted only with gum-water to succeed in this art man should be perfectly skilled in the art of designing or drawing but as most people who affect the one know little or nothing of the other and would have the pleasure of painting without giving themselves the trouble of learning to design which is indeed an art that is not acquired without great deal of time and continual appli- cation inventions have been found out to supply the place of it by means of which man designs or draws without knowing how to design ii the first is calking that is if you have mind to do print or design in miniature the back-side of it or another paper must be blacken ’ with small-coal and then rubb ’ very hard with the finger wradt in linnen cloth afterwards the cloth must be lightly drawn over the side so blacken ’ that no black grains may remain upon it to soil the velom you would paint upon and the print or draught must be fastened uron the velom with four pins to keep it from shifting and if it be ano¬ ther paper that is blacken ’ it must be put between the velom and the print or draught with the blacken ’ side upon the velom then with blunted pin or nee- dle you must pass over the principal lines or strokes of the print or draught the contours the plaits of the drapery and ver every thing elle that must be distin- guissied pressing so hard that the strokes nay be fatrly marked upon the velom un- derneath iii copying by squares is another con- venient method for such as are but little kill ’ in the art of designing and would copy pictures or other things that can not be calkeq the method is this the piece must be divided into many equal parts by little squares marked out with charcoal if the piece be clear and whitish and the black an be suirly seen upon it or with white chalk if it be too brown and dusky after which as many squares of equal di- nensions must be made on white paper apon which the piece must be designed ecause if this be done immediately upors velom as one is apt to mniscarry in the irst attempt the velom may be soiled with false touches but when it is neatly done upon paper it must be calked upon the velom in the manner before described when the origmal and the paperare thus rder ’ observe what is in each square of he piece to be designed asa head an arm an hand and so forth and place it in the corresponding part of the paper and thus finding where to place all the parts of the picce you have nothing to do but to form them well and to join them together by this method you may reduce or enlarge piece to what compass youplease makin the squares of your paper greater or lesse than those of the original but they mui always be of an equal number iv to copy picture or other thing in the same size and proportion another method is to make use of varnisn ’ paper or of the skin of hog ’ bladder vert transparent such as is to be had at the gold- beaters tale or isinglass will likewise de as well lay any one of those things upon your piece and thro ’ it you will see all the strokes and touches which are tobe drawn upon it with crayon or à pencil then take it off and fastening it under paper or velom set up both açainst the light in the manner of window and with crayon or silver needle mark out upon the paper or velom vou have put up- permost all the lines and touches you shall see drawn upon the varnished paper blad- der talc or isinglafs you have made use of and which will plainly appear thro this window after this manner making use of the window or of glass exposed to the light you may copy all sorts of prints designs and other pieces on paper or velom lay- ing and fastening them under the paper or velom upon which vou would draw them and tis very good and very easy con- trivance for deing pieces of the same size and proportion lf you have mind to make pieces look another way there is nothing to be done out to turn them laying the printed or drawn side upon the glass and fastening the paper or velom upon the back of it remembring to let your lights fall on the best side good method likewise to take true copy of picture in oil is to give touch of the pencil upon all the principal trokes with lake tempered with oil and to clap upon the whole paper of the same size then passing the hand over it the touches of the lake will stick and leave the design of your piece expressed upon the aper which may be calked like other things but you must remember to take off with the crum of bread what remains of the lake upon the picture before it be dry you may likewise make use of pounces made of powder ’ charcoal put in linnen rag with which the piece you would copy must be rubb ’ after you have prick' all the principal strokes or touches and fastened white paper or velom underneath but furer and easier help than all these for one who knows nothing of de- igning is mathematical compass it is generally made of ten pieces of wood in form of rulers half quarter of an inen thick half an inch broad and foot long or more according as you have mind to draw pieces of greater or lesser size to facilitate the construction of this instrument here exhibit figure of it with an ex- planation of the manner in which it is to be used this little beard is to be of fir and cover ’ with linnen or any other cloth because the piece you copy and the velom or paper you copy upon must be fixed upon it upon this board must the com- pafs also be fixed with large pin by the end of the first foot deep enough to keep it close but not so deep as to hinder it from turning easily when vou have mind to reduce things place your origi- nal on the side of the foot and the ve- lom or paper you would draw upon on the side of the foot removing the velom or drawing it nearer according as you in- tend to redace or enlarge in order to enlarge piece vou have nothing to do but to change the places of your original and your copy placing the last towards and the other on the side of and in both one and the other method crayon or leaden needle must be put in the foot under which the velom lies and pin à little blunted in that over the ori- ginal with which all the traces are to be followed conducting the pin with one hand and with the other pressing gently upon the crayon or needle that marks the velom when the crayon or needle bears sufficiently upon the veloimn you have no occasion to touch it by this instrument you may also draw in equal dimensions but in order to this the compass must be fixed in another manner upon the board for if it is to be fastened upon it by the middle at and your ori- ginal and your copy must be fix ’ on each side of this middle foot at equal distan- ces or from corner to corner that is from to when the pieces are large one may likewise draw several copies at once of equal and different dimensions vi these are all the helps can give to such as are not masters of design for those that are they have nothing to do with them when therfsore your piece is marked out upon the velom you must pafs with pencil of very clear carmine over all the traces to the end they may not be effaced as you work then clean your velom with the crum of bread that no black may re- main upon it vii your velom must be pasted upon little plate of brass or wood of the size you would make your piece to keep it firm and tight- but this pasting must be on the edges of your velom only and behind the plate for which purpose your velom must exceed your plate above an inch on every side for the part you paint upon must never be pasted because it would not enly give it an ill look but you could not take it off if you would cut off the little shags and locks of the velom and wet- ting the fair side with linnen cloth dipt in water clap the other upon the plate with clean paper between them so much as hangs over must be pasted upon the back of the plate drawing it equally on all sides and hard enough to stretch it well viii the chief colours made use of for painting in miniature are carmine venice and florence lake rose pink ermillion red lead brown red red orpiment uitramarine verditer indigo gall-stone yellow oker dutch pink gamboge naples yellow pale masticot deep yellow masticot avory-black lamp-black true indian ink bistre or wood-soot raw umber burnt umber sap-green verdegrease flake-white crayons of all colours gold and silver-shells leaf-gold or silver pallets of lvory and pencil-sticks lvory boxes containing lvory- shells in which are put the colours for miniature all the colours above-specified with every implement and utensil necessary in the prac- tice of painting in miniature are prepared and sold at most print-shops in london and westminster the seven transparent colours which are used where writingis seen thro the celour lake blue yellow liquid à grass-green dark-green purple colour brovn ix as all colours taken from earth and ther heavy matter are always too coarse they never so well ground especially for delicate work becaule of certain sand remaining in them the finest parts may be drawn out by diluting them with the finger in cup of water when they are well steeped let them settle while then pour out the clearest which will be at top into another vessel this will be the finest and must be let dry and when tis used must be diluted with guin-water as .shall shew hereafter this is very good contrivance especially for flake-wbite in which there is chalky matter which like the coarse and heavy parts in other colours sinks to the bottom of the cup it is steep in ir you mix littie of the gall of an ox carp or an eel particularly of the last in green black gray yellow and brown colours it will not only take away their greasy nature but also give them lustre and brightnefs they have not of themselves the gall of eels must be faken out when they are skinn ’ and hung upon nail to dry and when vou would use it it must be diluted with brandy and little of it mixd with the colour you have dilu- ted already this likewise makes the colour- stick better to the velom which it hardly does when it is greasy moreover this gal hinders it from scaling xi soue colours are made clearer by fire as tellow oaker brown red ultra- marine and umber all others are darken ’ by it but if you heat the said colours with sharp fire they change for the browon red becomes yellow jellow oaker becomes red umber reddens also ceruse by fire takes the colour of citron and is often called masticot observe that yellow oker heated becomes more tender than it was and softer than brown red likewise brovon red heated becomes softer than fine yellou oaker both are very proper the finest and truest ultramarine heated upon red-hot iron becomes more glittering but it wastes and is coarser and harder to work with in miniature when ’ tis purged after this manner xii all these colours are diluted in little cups of lvory made on purpose or in sea-shells with water in which gum- arabic and sugar candy are put for in- stance in glass of water put piece of gum as big as walnut and half that quantity of sugar candy this last hinders the colours from scaling when thy are laid on which they generally do when they want it or the velom is greasy this gum-water must be kept in neat bottle corked and never must you take any out of it with pencil that has colour upon it but with quill or some such thing some of this water is put in the shell with the colour you would temper and diluted with the finger till it be very fine- ff it be too hard you must let it soften in the shell with the said water before you dilute it afterwards let it dry and do thus with every colour except lilly-green sap-green and gamboge which must be temper ’ with fair water only but ultra- narine lake and bistre are to be more gummned than other colours lf you make use of sea-shells you must let them steep two or three days beforehand in water then cleanse them in boiling hot water mix ’ with vinegar in order to carry off certain salt which otherwise sticks to them and spoils the colours that are put to them xiii to know whether colours are sufficiently gummed you have nothing to do but to give stroke of the pencil upon your hand when they are diluted which- dries immediately lf they chap and scale there is too much gum if they rub out by passing the finger over them there is too little it may be seen likewise when the colours are laid on the velom by passing the finger over them if they stick to it like powder it is à sign there is not gumn enough and more must be put in the water with which you temper them take care though you do not put too much for that makes the colour extreamly hard and dry it may be known likewise by their glewiness and brightness so the more they are gum- med the darker they paint and when you have mind to give greater strength to colour than it has of itself you have nothing to do but to give it great deal of gum xiv provide yourself with an lvory pallet very smooth as big as your hand on one side of which the colours for the carnation or naked parts of picture are to be ranged in the following manner in the middle put à great deal of white prettv largely spread because it is the colour most made use of and upon the edge from the left to the right place the following co- lours at à little distance from the wbite masticot dutch pink orpiment yellow oker green composed of verditer dutch- pink and nhite in equal quan¬ tities biew made of uitramarine indigo and white to great degree of paleness vermillion carmine bistre and black on the other side of the pallet spread ome wbite in the same manner as for the carnation and when you have mind to paint draperies or other things place near he wbite the colour you would make ’ em of in order to work as ishall shew hereafter xv theuse of good pencils is great matter in order to make good choice wet them little and if the hairs keep close together as you turn them upon the finger and make but one point they are good but if they close not together but make several points and some are longer than others they are good for nothing not for dotting in particular and least of all for carnation when they are too sharp point- ed with only four or five hairs longer than the rest yet elosing all together they are notwithstanding good but they must be blunted with pair of scizzars taking care at the same time you do not dlip away too much tis proper to have two or three sorts of them the largest for laying the grounds and dead-colouring and the small- est for finishing to bring the hairs of your pencil to join close together and make good point you must often put the pencil just between your lips when you are at work moistening and pressing it close with the tongue even when there is colour upon it for if there be too much some of it is taken off by this means and enough left for giving fine ands equal touches you need not apprehend this will do you any harm none of thet colours for miniature except orpiment which is poison when they are prepared have either ill taste or ill quality this expedient must especially be used for dotting and for finisbing particularly the naked parts of picture that the touches may be neat and fair and not too much charged with colour as for draperies and other things as well in dead-colouring as in finishing ’ tis sufficient in order to make the hairs of your pencil join well and to unload it when it has too much colour to draw it upon the edge of the shell or upon the paper you must put upon your work to rest your hand on giving some strokes upon it before you work upon your piece xvi to work well in miniature you must do it in room that has but one win- dow and fix your self very near it with table and desk almost as high as the win- dow placing your self in such manner that the light may always come in on the left side and never forward or on the right when you would lay colour equally strong as for ground ke your mixtures in shells and for the thing you design to there be not enough tis but the colour you mix after- dark or too light after having spoken of velom colours let us now shew how employed in the first place you would paint piece be it drapery or any thing else you by dead-colouring that is to fays your colours on with liberal pencil in the smoothest man- as the painters do in oil not the force it is to have for fi- an make the light little the shades less dark than they because in dotting upon them do after dead-colouring the ways fortified and would at last here are several ways of dot- dry painter has his own some dots perfectly round others littie longish others batch ces that crofs each other every work appears as if'it had been dots this last method is the best the boldest and the soonest dc wherefore advise such as would painting miniature to use it and to inure the- selves froin the first to dot in the plump the soft way that is to say where the are lost in manner in the ground upon which you work and only so much appear as is sufficient to make the work seem ted the bard and the dry way is qu the reverse and always to be avoided is done by dotting with colour much da ker than your ground and when the pe- cil is not moisten ’ enough with the colour which makes the work seem rough and even- xx study likewise caresully to lose an drown your colours one in another so thin it may not appear where they disjoin an zo this end soften or allay your touch with colours that partake of both in suc sort that it may not appear to be you touches which cut and disjoin them the word cut conceive what manifesti separates and divides and does not run and blend it self with the neighbouring co lours which is rarely practis but upon the borders of drapery xxi when your pieces are finish ’ ti beighten them little gives them fine air that is to say to give upon the extremity of the lights small touches with colour lighter which must be lost and drewned th the rest xxii wlen the colours are dry upon your pallet or in your shells in order to them they must be diluted with water rid when you perceive they want gum ahiich is seen when they easily rub off the land or the velom if you give touch tith them upon either as have said alrea- they must be temper ’ with gum-watera stead of pure water till they are in good ondition xxiii there are several forts of grounds pictures and portraitures some are holly dark composed of bistre umbers id cologn-earth with little black and bite others more yellow in which is tixed great deal of oker others grayer hich partake of indigo in order to paint ground make wash of the colour or dixture you would have it or according to nat of the picture or portraiture you would opy that is to say verv light lay in hich there is hardly any thing but water order to soak the velom then pass nother lay over that somewhat thicker nd strike it on very smoothly with large trokes as quick as you can not touching wice in the same place before it be dry be ause the second stroke carries off what has been laid on at the first especially when you lean little too hard upon the pencil xxiv other dark grounds are li wise made of colour little greenish those are most in use and the properest lay under all sorts offigures and ’ ort raitu because thev make the carnation or na parts ofa picture appear very fine arel on very easily and there is no occasion dot them as one is often obliged to do others which are rarely made smooth even at the first whereas in these one dom fails of success at the first bout make them you must mix black du pink and white all together more or lesa each colour according as you would them darker or lighter you are to one zay very light and then thicker isaid of the first grounds you may make them of other colours if you plea but these are the most common xxv when you paint holy per upon one of these grounds and would pa small glory round the head of your figt you must not lay the colour tco thick that part or you may even lay none at especially where this glory is to be bright but lay for the first time with and little oker mix ’ together of af ficient thickness and in proportion as place of the head put à little and to make it lose it self and ith the colour of the ground free stroke of the pencil fol- ound of the glory sometimes our of which it is made and ith that of the ground mixing or oker with the last when dark to work with and do insensibly lost in another and seen to disjoin them fill an entire ground with rightest part is laid on with white adding more of the ortion as you come nearer the picture and when the oker enough for you must always and darker add gall-stone af- tle carmine- and lastly bistre ying or dead-colouring is to be as possible that is to say let ings lose themselves in one ano¬ gap or intersection then dot upon them with the same rder to drown the whole to- is pretty tedious and little cially when there are clouds he ground their lights must in proportion as you remove gure and finished as the rest and rounding the clouds- the bright and obscure parts of which must insensibly into one another xxvii for day-sky take ultramar- and good deal of white and mix thn together with this make lay as sinoch as you can with large pencil and libei strokes as for grounds applying it paa and paler as you descend towards the hclf zon which must be done with vermillion red lead and with white of the sae strength with that where the sky ends less making this blew lose it the red which you bring down to of the earth or tops of house mixing towards the end gall-stone anca good deal of white in such manner tlt the mixture be still paler than the formy without any visible intersection or partiij between all these colours of the sky xxviii when there are clouds in sky ycu may spare the places where the are to be that is to say you need not le en any biezo there but form them if the are reddisn with vermillion gall-stone al white with little indigo and if they more upon black put in good deal the last painting the lights of one and th ther wich masticot vermillion and whit more or less of any of these colours accort ing to the strength you would give then or according to that of the original you in ding the whole as you dot for ult matter to lay them very fmooth painting and if the sky is not igh you must dot it allo your pleafure to exempt the places uds for you may lay them upon ad of the sky heightening the ts by putting good deal of white ying the shadows by using less shortest way night or stormy sky is done black and white inixed toge- ich is laid as for day-sky to ire must be added oker vermilli- von-red for the clouds the lights re to ve of masticot or red lead white now redder now yel- discretion and when it is à tem- ky andlightening appears in some it blue or red it is to be done ay-sky drowning and losing the gether at the first-forming or dead- and at the finishing of draperies to paint blew drapery ultramarine near the upon your pallet and mik part of with the other till it makes fine and has body with this mixture must form the brightest parts and adding more uitramarine form such as darker and go on after this manner you come to the deepest plaits and thickest shades where you must lay uitramarine and all this must be don for first-forming or dead-colouring is to say laying the colour on with strokes of the pencil yet as smooth as can losing the lights of the shadcws wi colour neither so pale as the lights no dack as the shades then dot with same colour as in the first-forming small matter deeper that the dots-may fairly seen all the parts must be drou one in another and the plaits appearw out intersection when the uliramarin not dark enough to make the deeper dows houv well soever it be gummied à little indigo with it to finish them when the extremities of the lights are bright enough heighten them with and very little ultramarine xxxi drapery of carmine is done the same manner as the blue except at in the darkest places there is to be ay of pure vermillion before you dead-co- ur with carmine which must be applied top and in the strongest shades it must gumm ’ very much to deepen it the lore mix à little bistre with it xxxii there is likewise made another ed drapery which is first drawn with ermillion mixing white with it to dead-co¬ ur the bright places laying it pure and ninixed for such as are darker and adding armine for the grand shades tis finish ’ fterwards like other draperies with the same colours and when the carmine with ne vermillion don ’ darken enough work with the first alone but only in the deepest if the shades xxxiii drapery of lake is made in he same manner with that of carmine nixing good deal of white with it for the right places and very little for those that re dark tisfinished likewise with dotting ut you have nothing to do with vermillion nit xxxiv violet-draperies are likewise done after this manner after making mix- ure of carmine and ultramarine putting always white for the bright parts if yt would have your violet be columbine there must be more carmi than uitramarine but if you would han it blewer and deeper put more ultramari chan carmine xxxv drapery is made of flest colour beginning with lay made of whit vermillion and very pale lake and makin the shades with the saine colours using le white in them this drapery must be ver pale and tender because the stuff of th colour is thin and light and even the shadt of it ought not to be deep xxxvi to make yellow drapery put à lay of masticot over all then one gamboge uron that excepting the brightei places where the masticot must be left en tire then dead-colour with oker mix' with little gamboge and masticot puttin more or less of the last according to th strength of the shades and when these colcurs dont darken enough add gall-stone and gall-stene pure and unmix ’ is used fo the thickest shides mixing little bistr with it if there be occasion to make then still darker you finish by dotting with the same colours you dead-colour ’ with anc losing the lights and the shades in one an other xxxvii ir you put naples-tellow or dutch pink in lieu of masticot and gamboge ju will make another sort of yelloep xxxviii the green drapery is made ra general lay of verditer with which you find it too blue mix masticot for the ights and gamboge for the sbades after- ards add to this- mixture lilly-green or sap- green to shadow with and as the shades thicker put more of these last greens id even work with them pure and uninix here they are to be extreamly dark you ish with the same colours à little darker by putting more telloo or more blue thele colours you may make different rts of greens as you please xxxix to make black drapery vou ad-colour with black and white and fi- sh with the same colour putting more lack as the shades are thicker and for darkest mix indigo with it especially hen you would have he drapery appear like elvet you may always give some touches ith brighter colour to heighten the ghts of any drapery whatsoever xl white woolen drapery is made lay of white in which there must be very small matter of oker orpiment or all-stone that it may look little yellowish then dead-colour and finisn the sha with blue little black white and bist putting great deal of the last in the dark xli the light-gray is begun black and white and finish ’ with the sa colour deeper xlii for à brown drapery make bistre white and little brown- and shadow with this mixture made lis darker xliii tiere are other draperies led variable because the lights are of colour from the shades these mostly used for the vestments of angels young and gay people for scarfs and ot airy attire admitting of great many fol and flowing at the pleasure of the wij the most common are the violet of wh they make two sorts one where the lig are blue and the other where they are low xliv for the first put lay of ult marine and very pale white upon the ligh and shadow with carmine ultramarine white as for à drapery wholly violet- that enly the grand lights appear blue they must be dotted with violet in wh there is great deal of ’ hite and lost sensibly in the shades xlv the other is done by putting upon lights only instead of blue lay of asticot working the rest as in the drapery violet excepting that it must be dotted dthe light partsblended with the sbadoty at is the tellow with the violet with de gamboge xlvi the carmine-red is done like last that is let the lights be done with asticot and the sbades wich carmine and lose the one in the other make use of gamboge xlvii the lake-red is done like that carmine xlviii the green is done as the lake ways mixing verditer with lilly or sap- reen to make the sbades which are not dry dark xlix several other sorts of draperies ay be made at discretion always taking re to preserve the union of the colours only in one fort of cloth or so but also group of several figures avoiding as uch as the subject will allow the putting blue near the colour of fire of green ainst black and so of other colours which it and disjoin and whose union is not nd enough several other draperies are mas of foul colours as brown-red bistre in digo and all in the same mannt likewise of other colours simple and cor- pound the agreement between which always to be minded that the mixture ma produce nothing harsh and disagreeable the eye no certain rule can be laid dov for this the force and effect of your lours are only to be known from use ar experience and you must work accordir to that knowledge li linen cloaths are done thus after drawing the plaits or folds as is done in drapery put à lay of white over all the deag-colour and finish the shades with mixture of ultramarine black and wbite using more or less of the last according their strength or tenderness and in th greatest deepnings put bistre mix ’ with little white giving only some touches this mixture and even of pure bistre upo the extremities of the greatest shadows where the folds must be drawn and los with the rest lii they may be done in another man ner by making general lay of this mix- ture of uitramarine black and very palt white and dead-colour as said before with the same colour but little deeper ie shades are dotted and finish ’ lights with pure white and th the deepnings of the linnen ever fort you make them when shd you must give yellowish piment and white to certain pla- it lightly on and as it were in that what is underneath may ling plainly appear as well the he dotting oz linnen cloaths are done by of white mix ’ with little form and finish the shades with with white and oker and in sbades use pure bistre and be- sh give some teints here and vand white and others of white- rine as well upon the shades as but let them be very bright the whole together in dotting ok finely as you sinish heigh- remities of the lights with mas- ite you may add to this sort as well as to the white certain ace to space as in turkey-man- small stripes blue and red with and carmine one of red be- of blue very bright and clear ghts and deeper upon the shades pretty often dress ’ with vails by popisp painters and scarfs are put about necks that are bare because they become the teint might well liv ir you would have both these sort of linnen transparent and the stuff other thing that is beneath appear throug them make the first lay for them ver light and clear and mix in the colour tu shadow with little of that which is under neath especially towards the end of th shades and only do the extremities of the lights for the yellow with masticot ant wnite and for the white with pure white they may be done in another manner especially when you wou ’ have them allto- gether as clear as mustin lavn or gawze to this end form and finish what is to be beneath as if nothing was to be put over it then mark out the light and clear folds with white or masticot and shadowy with bistre and white or with black blue and wbite according to the colour you would make them of making the rest some- what fainter yet this is not necessary but for the parts that are not to be so clear lv crape is done the same way ex- cepting that the folds ofthe shades and the zights and the borders too are to be markd out with little filaments of black upon what is underneath which is likewise to be finished before hand lvi when you would make stuff like zeatered tabby make the waves upon it with colour little lighter or little dar- ker in the lights and the shades lvii there is manner of touching draperies which distinguishies the silken from the woolen the last are more ter- restrial and sensible the others more light and fading but it must be observed that this is an effect which depends partly upor the stuff and partly upon the colour and for employing these in manner suitable to the subyects and the deepnings of painting will here touch upon their different qua- lities lviii we have no colour which par- takes more of light nor which comes nearer the air than white which shews it to be fickle and fleeting it may never- theless be held and brought to by some neighbouring colour more heavy and sen- sible or by mxing them together lix blue is most fleeting colour and so we see that the sky and the remotest views of picture are of this colour- but it will become lighter and fickler in propor- tion as it is mix with white lx pure black is the heaviest and most terrestrial of all colours and the more of it you mix with others the nearer youbring them to the eye nevertheless the different dispositions of black and white make also their effects different for white often makes black dis- appear and black brings white more into view as in the reflection of globes or other figures to be made round where there are always parts that sly as it were from the eye and deceive it by the craft of art and under the white are here comprehended all the light colours as un- der the black all the heavy colours uitramarine is then solt and light oker is not so much so masticot is very light and so is verditer vermillion and carmine come near this quality orptment and gamboge not so near lake holds certain mean rather soft than rough dutch-pink is an indifferent colour easily taking the quality of others so it is made terrestrial by mixing it with colours that are so and on the contrary the most light and fleeting by joining it with white or blue brown-red umber dark-greens and bistre are the heaviest and most terrestrial next to elack lxi skilful painters who under- stand perspective and the harmony of colours always observe to place the dark and sensible colours on the fore-parts of their pictures and the most light and fleet- ing they use for the distances and remote views and as for the union of colours the different mixtures that may be made of them will learn you the friendship or antipathy they have to one another and upon this you must take your measures for placing them with such agreement as shall please the eye lxii for the doing of lace french- points or other things of that nature put over all lay of blue black and white as for linen then heighten the flower-work with pure white afterwards make the sbades above with the first colour and fi- nish them with the same when they are upon the carnation or naked parts of picture or uron any thing else that you would shew through another finisn what is beneath as if nothing was to be put over it and at top make the points or lace with pure white shadowing and finishing them with the other mixture lxiii if you would paint fur you must begin with kind of drapery done if it be dark with bistre and white making the shadowings of the same colour with less white if the fur be white do it with blue white and little bistre and when this beginning or first-forming is done instead of dotting draw small strokes turn- ing now in one manner now in another according to the course and flatting of the hair heighten the ligbis of dark furs with oker and white and of the other with white and little blue lxiv for doing building if it be of stone take indigo bistre and white with which make the beginning or first form of it and for shadowing it put less of this last and more bistre than indigo according to the colour of the stone vou would paint to these you may likewise add little oker both for the forming and the finishing but to make it finer you must give here and there especially for old fabricks blue and yellow teints some with oker others with uitramarine nuxing always white with them whether before the first-forming provided they appear through the draught or whether upon it loosing and drowning them wich the rest when you finisn lxv wien the building is of wood as there are iany sorts it is done at dis- cretion but the most ordinary way is to begin or first-form with oker bistre and white and finish without white or with ry little and if the shades are deep with are bistre in the other they add some- nes vermillion sometimes green or black word just according to the colour they would give it and they finish with dotting as in draperies and every thing use of carnations or the na- ked parts of painting xvi trhere are in carnation so many different colourings that it would be difficult thing to give general rules upon so varia- le subject nor are they minded when one has got by custom and practice some habit of working easily and such as are arrived to this degree employ themselves in copying their originals or else they work upon their ideas without knowing how insomuch that the most skilful who do it with less reflection and pains than others would likewise be more put to it to give an account of their maxims and knowledge in the matter of painting if they were to be asked what colours they made use of for making such and such co- louring teint here and another there nevertheless as beginners for whom design this little work want some instruc tion at the first will shew in general after what manner several carnations are be done lxvii in the first place after havin drawn your figure with carmine and or- dered your piece apply for women anc children and generally for all tender colourings lay of white mixed witf never so little of the blue made for faces of which lhave told the composition but let it hardly be seen lxviii and for men instead of blue they put in this first lay little vermillion and when they are old little oker is mix' with it lxix afterwards sollow all the tra- ces with vermillion carmine and white mixed together and begin all the sbades with this mixture adding white in propor¬ tion as they are weaker and putting but little in the darkest and none in manner in certain places where strong touches are to be given for instance in the corner of the eye under the nose at the ears under the chin in the separations ef the fingers in all the joints at the corners of the nails and generally in every part where you would mark out separations in shades ades that are obscure neither need you yar to give to those places all the force and strength they ought to have as soon as you begin or first-formthem because in working top with green the red you have put there is always weakned lxx after having begun or first- formed or dead-coloured with red make blue teints with ultramarine and great eal of white upon the parts which sly om the eye that is to say upon the tem- les under and in the corners ofthe eyes both sides the mouth above and below little upon the middle of the forehead etween the nose and the eyes on the side the cheeks on the neck and other pla- es where the flesh has know not what blue cast with it yellowish teints are likewise made with jker or orpiment and little vermillion mixt with white under the eye-brows on he sides of the nose towards the bottom little underneath the cheeks andupon the other parts which rise and come nearer the eye 't is especially for these teints that the natural complexion is to be observed in- order to catch it for painting being an imitation of nature the perfection of the art consists in the justness and simplicity of the representation especially in face- painting lxxi when therefore you have done your first lay your dead-colouring arha your teints you must work upon the shadot dotting with green for the carnations naked parts mixing according to the ruy have given for the teints little blue fe the parts which sly from the eye and the other hand making it à little yellowes for those that are more sensible that is say which rise and come nearer the eyt and at the end of the shades on the sics of the light you must blend and lose you colour insensibly in the ground of the can nation with blue and then with red accore ing to the places where you paint if this mixture of green does not work dark enougld at first pafs over the shades several times now with red and now with green alway dotting and this do till they are as thet should be lxxii anp if you can not with these colours give the shades all the force they ought to have finish in the darkest witf bistre mixt with orpiment oker or ver- million and sometimes with pure bistre according to the colouring you would make but lightly laying on your colour very clear lxxiii you must dot upon the clear and bright places with little vermillion or with much white and very of oker in order to lose them dowy and to make the teints nsibly into one another taking dot or batch to make vour the turnings and windings parts for tho the rule be ys this dotting or hatching car à little more here because arts mixture might make co- ed if it was always to be used tewise in every part to blend id the shades with blue and ind much white so mixed as to excepting nevertheless that must not be put upon the upon the extremities of the no more than the other mix- nese last which must be left light as certain places of the nose and of the fore- upon the cheeks which and ught nevertheless to be red- rest as well as the feet the he hands and the fingers of that these two last mixtures so pale that the work shall ble for they serve only to sof- ite the teints with one another ides with the lights and to races care must likewise be taken taken that you work not too much wit the red mixture upon the blue teints no with the blue upon the others but chang the colour from time to time when yo- perceive it works too blue or too red til the work be finished lxxiv the white of the eyes must be shadowed with this same blue and littlu flesh-colour and the corners on the sidt of the nose with vermillion and white giving them little touch of carmine the whole is softened with this mixture of vermiilion carmine white and very smal matter of oker the apples or balls of the eyes are done with the mixture of ultramarine and white- the last prevailing little adding little bistre if they are yellowish or little black if they are gray make the little black circle in the middle called the cbrys- tal of the eye and shadow the balls with indigo bistre or black according to the colour they are of giving to each sinall touch of pure vermillion round the chrys- tal which must be lost with the rest at the finishing this gives vivacity to the eye the kound or circumference of the eye is done with bistre and carmine that is to say the slits or partings and the eye-lids when they are large and bold especially the upper ones which must after wards be soften ’ with the red or blue mixtures lave mentioned before to the end they nay be lost in one another and nothing seem intersected when this is done give à little touch of ure white upon the cbrystal on the side of the ligbts this makes the eye shine and gives life to it lxxv the mouth is dead-coloured with vermillion mik with white and fi- nish ’ with carmine which is softened as the rest and when the carmine does not work dark enough mik little bistre with it this is to be understood of tlie corners in the separation of the lips and particu- larly of certain mouths half open lxxvi tie hands and all the other parts of carnation are done in the same mannér as the faces observing that the ends of the fingers be little redder than the rest when your whole work is form ’ and dotted mark the separations of all the parts with little touches of carmine and orpiment mix ’ together as well in the shadowy as the light places but little deeper and stronger in the first and lase them in the rest of the carnation lxxvii the eye-brows and the beard are dead-colour as are the shades of carnations and finished with bistre oker or black according to the colour they are of drawing thein by little strokes the way they oughe to go that is to say give themf all the nature of hair the lights of them mustbe heightened with oker and bistre a vermillion and much white lxxviii for the hair of the head make à lay of bistre oker and white and à little vermillion when it is very dark colour ’ use black instead of oker after- wards form the shadocoy parts with the same colours putting less white in them and finish with pure bistre or mix ’ with oaker or black by small strokes very fine and close to each other waving and buckling them according to the curling of the hair the light parts must also be heighten ’ by little strokes with oker or orpiment white and littie vermillion after which lose the lights and the sbades in each other by working sometimes with dark and some- tiines with pale colour and for the hair about the forehead thro which the skin is seen it must be first formed with the colour thereof and that of the carnation working and shadowing with one and the other as if vou designed to paint none then form it and finish with bistre the lights are to be heigh- ten ’ as the other gray hair is dead-colour ’ with white black and bistre and finished with the same colour but deeper heightening the bright and clear parts of the hair as well as those ofthe eye-brows and the beard with wbite ind very pale blue after having form ’ them as the others with the colour of the fleshi or skin and finisn with bistre lxxix but the most important thing is to soften one work to blend the teints in one another as well as the beard and the hair about the forehead with the other hair and the carnation taking especial care not to work rongh and dry and that the traces turnings and windings of the carnation or naked parts be not inter- sected you must likewise accustom yourself to put wbite in your colours only in propor¬ tion as you work lighter or darker for the colour you use the second time must be always little stronger and deeper than the first unless it be for softening lxxx different colourings are ea- sily made by putting more or less of red or blue or yellow or bistre whether for the dead-colouring or for the finishing that for women ought to be blueish that for children little red and both fresh and florid that for men ought to be yellower especially when they are old lxxxi to make cclouring of death there must be first lay of white and or piment or very pale oker dead-colour wit vermi-lion and lake instead of carmine and good deal of white and afterward work over it with green mixture in whicl there is more blue than any other colour to the end the flesn may be livid and of purple colour the teints are done the same way as in another colouring bur there must be great many more blue than yelloze ones especially upon the parts whick fly from the sight and about the eyes anc the last are only to be upon the parts whick rise and com- nearer the eye they are made to die away one in another according to the ordinary manner sometimes with very pale blue and scmetimes with oker- and white and alittle vermillion softning the whole together the parts and con- tours must be rounded with the same co- lours the mouth is to be in manner of violet tis dead-coloured however with little vermillion oker and white but finished with lake and blue and to give it the deep strokes they take bistre and lake with which they likewise do the same to the eyes the nose and the ears if it is à crucifix or some martyr upon whom blood is to be seen after the finish- ng the carnation form it with vermillion and finish it with carmine making in the drops of blood littie bright reflecting park to round them for the crown of thorns make lay of vea-green and masticot shadow it witli sistre and green and heighten the clear ind light parts with masticot lxxxii iron is formed or first laid vith indigo little black and white and inished with pure indigo heightening it vith white lxxxiii for painting fire and flames he lights are done with masticot and or- oiment and for the shades they mix ver- nillion and carmine lxxxiv smoke is done with black indigo and white and sometimes with bistre one may likewise add vermillion or oker according to the colour it is to be of lxxxv pearlsare painted by putting à lay of white and little blue they are shadowed and rounded with the same colour deeper small white dot is made almost in the middle on the side of the light and en the other side between the shadow and the edge of the pearl they give touch with masticot to make ti reftection and under the pearls is made little shadow of the colour of the groui they are upon lxxxvi diamonds are done wins pure black then they heighten them wits iittle touches of white on the side of th light it is the same thing for any othel jewels you have mind to paint thet is nothing to be done but to change th colour lxxxvii for making figure gold put à lay of shell-gold and shadov it with gall-stone silver is done the same way exceptin that it must be shadow ’ with indigo lxxxviii thus have particulari- set down several little matters to help be ginners for the method of doing these and the colours that are used in them wil likewise help for such things as have no mentioned waiting for the skill and facii lity which time and experience are used te give to such as apply themselves to this art one great means to acquire perfectior in it is to copy excellent originals we enjoy with pleasure and tranquility labour and pains of others but man nust copy great number before hie is able to produce as fine effects and it is better to be good copier than bad au- thor the instructions have given for the mixtures and different tinctures for the colouring of carnations and other things may particularly serve for working after prints where nothing is seen but black ind white though they are not unprofita- ple when one begins to copy after pictures without skill in the management of co- lours and without knowing their force and effect for there is this differenc- between miniature and painting in oil that in the last the colours are taken upon the pallet just as they appear in the pic- ture where they are laid on at once insomuch that nothing is to be done but to consider à little what will make such light and what such shade but it is not thus in miniature where pretty often the last lay that is applied does not keep ts colour but takes another from the first that has been wrought underneath- or rather one and the other compose à third which has the desired effect and hough for example it be white green armine blue orpiment bistre of which this colouring is composed these olours nevertheless do not produce it if you mix them together for it is not only by working first with one then witl another that the thing is done an when man sees this effect without hav ing seen how it is produced he must least be conjurer to discover the orde and manner of it supposing that he hat neither book nor master for this reasof applied myself to particularize so mant little instructions in this matter and af sure myself that experience will shew te such as are in capacity to make use them that tho ’ they are small they are no less useful of landskips lxxxix 't is particularly for land- skips that the arti- le is esteemed and the following on the nature and different qualities of colcurs because the order and distribution that are made of them will do much towards shewing the remote and the near views which deceive the eye and the greatest painters of landskip have always observed to place the most terrestrial and sensible colours upon the first lines of their land- skip reserving the lightest for the dis- tances but that may not wander from my de- sign instead of general precepts will stop to give beginners some particular in- structions for practice xc in the first place after having or- dered the cconomy of your landsiip as of your other pieces you must form the near- est grounds or lands when they are to ap- pear dark with sap or lilly-green bistre and little verditer to give body to your colour then dot with this mixture but little darker adding sometimes little black to it for such pieces of ground as the light falls upon and which are therefore clear and bright make lay of oker and white then shadow and finish with bistre in some they mix littit green particularlys for shadowing and finishing there are sometimes upon the fore- part certain reddish lands which are dead- coloured with brown red white and little green and finished with the same puttinga little more green in them for the making of grafs and leaves upon the fore-ground you must when that is finissed form with sea-green or verditer and little wbite and for thole that are vel- lowisn mix masticot asterwards shadow them with lilly-green or bistre and gall- stone ifyou would have thei appear wither ’ the grounds or lands at à little dis- tance are formed with verditer and sha- dowed and finished with sap-green adding bistre for some touches here and there such as are at greater distance are done with sea-green and little blue and shadowd with verditer in word the farther they go the more blueisp they are to be made and the farthest distances ought to be of ultramarine and white mixing in some places small touches of vermillion xci water is painted with indigo and white and shadow ’ with the same colour but deeper and to finish it instead of dot- ting they do nothing but make strokes and traces without crosling giving them the same turn with the waves when there are any sometimes little green must be mixed in certain places and the light and elear parts heightened with pure white par- ticularly where the water foams rocks are dead-coloured like buildings of stone excepting that little green is mix ’ for forming and shadowing them blue and yellow teints are made upon them and lost with the rest in finishing and when there are small branches with leaves moss or grass when all is finisn ’ thev are to be raised at top with green and masticot they may be made yellow green and reddissi for appearing dry in the same manner as on the ground rocks are dotted as the rest and the farther they are off the more grayisn they are made castles old houses and other buildings of stone and wood are done in the man- ner have mentioned before speaking of those things when they are upon the first lines but when you would have them appear at à distance you must mix brocon- red and vermillion with much white and shadow very tenderly with this mixture and the farther they are off the weaker are the strokes to be for the separations iis they are covered with slate it is to be mades bluer than the rest xcii trees are not done till the sky be finished one may nevertheless spare the places of them when they contain good number and however it be such as come near the eye are to be dead-colour ’ with verditer mixing sometimes oker and shadowd with the same colours adding lilly-green afterwards you must work leaves upon them by dotting without rossing for this must be done with small ongisn dots of darker colour and pret- full of it which miust be conducted on he side the branches go by little tufts of little darker colour then heighten the lights with verditer or sea-green and mas- icot making leaves in the same manner and when there are dry branches or leaves hey are dead-coloured with brozon-red or zall-stone with white and finished with rall-stone without white or wich bistre the trunks of trees are to be dead-co- our ’ with oker wbite and little green or the light and clear parts and for the lark they mix black adding bistre and areen for shadowing one and the other lue and yellow teints are likewise made pon them and little touches given here and here with white and masticct such as you rdinarily see upon the bark of trees the branches which appear among the leaves are done with oker verditer and white or with bistre and white according to the light they are placed in they must be shadowd with bistre and lilly-green trees which are at little distance are dead-coloured with verditer and sea-green and are shadow ’ and finished with the same colours mix ’ with lilly-green when there are some which appear yellowish lay with oker and wbite and finish with gall-stone for such as are in the distances and re- mote views you must dead-colour with sea-green with which for finishing you must mix uitramarine heighten the lights of one and the other with masticot by small disjoined leaves tis the most difficult part of landstip oc and in manner of miniature to leaf tre well to learn and break one ’ hand to it à little the way is to copy good ones or the manner of touching them is singular and can not be acquired but by working upon trees themselves about which you must observe to make little boughs which must be leafed especially such as are below and towards the sky and ’ generally let your landstips be co- loured in handsom manner and full of nature and truth for ’ tis that which gives them all their beauty of flowers xciii it is an agreeable thing to paint flowers not only on account of the splendor of their different colours but also by reason of the little time and pains that are bestowed in trimming them there is nothing but delight in it and in manner no application you maim and bungle face if you make one eye higher or lower than another small nose with large mouth and so of other parts but the fears of these disproportions constrain not the mind at all in flower-painting for unless they be very remarkable for this reason they spoil nothing most persons of quality who divert them- selves with painting keep to flowers nevertheless you must apply yourself to copy justly and for this part of mini- ature as for the rest refer you to nature for she is your best model work then after natural flowers and look for the teints and different colours of them upon your pallet little use will make you find them easily and to facilitate this to you at the first shall in the continu- ance ance of my design shew the manner of painting some for natural flowers are not always to be had and one is often obliged to work after prints where nothing is seen but graving xciv tisa general rule that flowers are designed and laid like other figures but the manner of formingand finishing them is different for they are first formed only by large strokes and traces which you must turn at the first the way the small ones are to go with which you finish this turn- ing aiding much thereto and for finish- ing them instead of hatching or dotting you draw small strokes very fine and very close to one another without croffing rez paffing several timies ’ till your dark and your clear parts have all the force you would give them of roses xcv fter making your first sketch draw with carminethe red-rose ly very pale lay of carmine and and ap white then form the shades with the same colour putting less wbite in it and lastly with pure carmine but very bright and clear at the first fortifying it more and more as you proceed in your work and according to the darkness of the shades this is done by large strokes then finish working upon it with the same colour by little strokes which you inust make go the same way with those of the graving if it be print you copy or the way the leaves of the rose turn if you copy after painting or after nature losing the dark in the clear parts and heightening the greatest lights and the brightest or mest lightsome leaves with wbite and little carmine you must always make the hearts of roses and the side of the shadow darker than the rest and mix à little indigo for shadowing the first leaves particularly when the roses are blown to make them seem faded the seed is dead-coloured with gamboge- with which little sap-green is mixed for shadowing roses streaked with several colours ought to be paler than others that the mixture of colours may be better seen which are done with carmine little dar- ker in the shades and very clear in the lights always hatching by strokes for white roses you must put à zay of white and form and finish them as the red but with black white and little bistre and make the seed little yellower yellow roses are done by putting in every part à lay of masticot and shadowing them with gamboge gall-stone and bistre heightening the clear and light places with masticot and white the styles the leaves and the buds of all sorts of roses are formed with verditer with which is mixed little masticot and gamboge and for shadowing them they add sap-green putting less of the other colours when the shades are deep the qut-side of the leaves ought to be blewer than the inside wherefore it must be dead-colourd with sea-green and sap-green mix with that for shadowing making the veins or fibres on this side clearer than the ground and those on the other side darker the prickles which are upon the stiles and buds of roses are done with lirtle touches of carmine which are made to go every way and for those that are upon the stalks they are formed with verditer and carmine and shadow ’ with carmine and bistre making the bottom of the stalks more reddisn than the top that is to say you must mik with the green carmine and pure bistre of tulips xcvi as there are an infinity of tulips different from one another one can not pretend to mention the colours with which they are all done will only touch upon the handsomest called streaked and these streaks are dead-coloured with very clear carmine in some places and with dar- ker in others finishing with the same co- lour by little strokes which must be carriedj the same way with the streaks and ini others is put first lay of vermillion then they form them by mixing carmine and finish them wich pure carmine in some they put florence-lake over the vermillion instead of carmine some are done with lake and carmine mixed together and with lake alone or with white and lake for the first forming whether it be rose-pink or florence-lake there are some of purple colour which are formed with ultramarine car- mine or lake sometimes blewer and some- times redder the manner of doing both one and the other is the same there is no difference but in the colours you must in certain places as-hetween che streaks of vermillion carmine or lake sometimes put blue made of ultramarine and white and sometimes very bright purple which is finished by strokes as the rest and lost with the streaks there are some likewise which have fallow teints that are made with lake bistre and oaker according as they are but this is only in sine and rare tulips and not in the common ones for shadowing the bottom of themi they ordinarily take indigo and white for such whose streaks are of carmine for such as are of lake they take black and white with wnich in some bistre is mix ’ mix ’ and in others green some are likewise to be shadow ’ with gamboge and umber and always by strokes and races that turn as the leaves turn other tulips are likewise done call ’ bor- der ’ that is to say the tulip is not streaked but on the edges of the leaves where there is border it is white in the purple red in the yellow yellow in the red and red in the white the purple is laid wich uitramarine carmine and white shadowing and finishing it with this mixture the border is spar ’ that is to say let only light lay of white be put there and let it be shadowed with ve ry bright indigo the yellote is form ’ with gamboge and shadowed with the same colour mixing oker and umber or bistre with it the border is laid with vermillion and finished with very small matter of carmine the red is forin ’ with vermillion and finished with the same colour mixing car- mine or lake with it the bottom and the border are done with gamboge and for fi- nishing they add gall-stone and umber or bistre the white is shadowed with black blue and white indian ink is very proper for this the shadowings of it are very tender lt produccs alone the effect of blue and white mixed with other black the border of this white tulip is done with carmine in all these sorts of tulips they leave nerve or sinew in the middle of the leaves that are brighter than the rest and the borders are drowned with the bottom by small traces turning crosswise for they must not appear cut and separated as the streaked or party-coloured they make them likewise of several other colours when they happen to be such whose bottoms on the inside are black as it were they form and finisn them with indigo as also the seed about the nozzle or staik and if the bottom is yellow it is form ’ with gamboge and finisned by add- ing umber or bistre the leaves and the stalks of tulips are ordinarily forin ’ with sea-green and sha- dowed and finisned with lilly-green by large traces all along the leaves some may likewise be done with verditer mixing masticot with it and shadowed with sap- green that the green of the shades may be yello wer the emony or wind-flower xcvii there are several sorts of them as well double as single the last are ordinarily without streaks some are made of purple colour with purple and shadowing them with the same ne redder others blewer some- ale and sometimes very dark forin ’ with lake and white with the same putting less without any white at all re forin ’ with vermillion and ith the same colour adding tewise white onee and some of olour the last are laid with nd one and the other shadow ’ sometimes with vermillion and ith very brown lake especial- seed at the bottom which is se of blackisn colour that is ndigo or black and blue mix¬ little bistre and always very fine strokes and traces lights in the shades others that are brighter and bottom than any where else es they are perfectly white there rest of the flower be dark of all these emonies is done and black with very little shadowed with indigo and in ised wich masticot le emontes are of several co- handsomest have their large ked some are done that is or party-coloured wich vermil- carmine is added for the finish- ing ing shadowing the rest of the leaves wit indigo and fer the small leaves within à lay is put of vermillien and white an they are

down the methods begin then with carmine steep pound of brasil wood of fe nambuca of the colour of gold fe three or four days in an earthen vessel pot of white wine-vinegar after havins broken it well in mortar boil it half hour then pass or strain it through ver coarse linnen cloth and set it again upoi the fire take another little pot of whit wine-vinegar and in it steep or tempe eight ounces of allum put this allui temperd in the other liquor and stir about well with spattle the scuin froth that rises is your carmine take it off as it rises and let it dry the same may be done with cochineal instead brasil ultramarine take ten ounces of linseed-oil pu it in an earthen pot or platter witl seven or eight drops of common water and then set and keep it on the fire till it be gins to boil to this put pound of white virgin ’ -wax broken in small pieces wher the wax is melted put in pound of greek pitch-mixing with it four ounces of pow der mastick which must be melted befort in pot by it selfs with two ounces of tur- gentine let the whole boil for an hour and then let the composition drop into cold water and when it is of the consistence of butter it is done enough but if you find any hard callous bits in it tis sign the mastick is not melted enough and when you must put the composition again upon the fire the whole being done enough put la- bis lazuli in crucible upon the fire till it be as red as the fire it self then throw it into white wine-vinegar twill drink up the vinegar till it burst and reduce it self to little pieces which must be beat to powder then incorporate this powder with little of the fore-mention ’ compo- sition the smallest matter possible and keep it thus for about fifteen days after which fix board bending little down- wards upon the edge of table it will be proper tohave channel or furrow cut in this board onder the board place glass receiver and put your blue paste on the top of the channel and over the paste fix vessel of water to distil drop by drop upon the paste and with the small end of sine polish ’ stick assist the water to di- lute the paste by stirring and moving it little to and fro very genely the first zury which comes off drop by drop is the bluest when it comes off not so fine afterwards you must change your vessel to receive the second blue after which there comes off third which is likewise of use and must be kept let these three sort of ultramarine dry then take and put them separately in little bags of white leaf for the making of carmine and ul- tramarine after different ways like- wise fine lakes columbines greens and other colours after several me- thods all proper for miniature carmine take three pints of spring-water which has not pass ’ through lead- pipes pour it into glaz ’ earthen pot and set it on the fire when it is ready to boils put in half or quarter of an ounce of the grain of cohan or dyer red which the feather dyers use reduc ’ to fine powder then let it boil about three quar- ters rs of an hour or tiil the fourth part of ie water be consum but take care it coal-fire after which strain this ater through linnen cloth into another gla'id vessel and heat it till it begins to oil then add to it an ounce of cochineal nd quarter of an ounce of arnatto both educ to powder serarately and set this mixture boil away to haif or in better etter terms till it raises black scuin nd be very red for by means of boiling it akes colour take it off the fire and strew in it half an ounce or three pinches of pulveriz ’ roach-allum or of roman allum which is reddisn and better and half quarter of an hour after strain it through linnen-cloth into giaz ’ ves- sel or else divide it in several little dutch or glaz ’ porringers where let it settle for twelve or fifteen days and you will see on the surface mouldy skin which must be taken off with sponge and the matter underneath expos to the air when the water at the top is evaporated dry the matter which rests at the bottom and grind it upon very hard and very smooth piece of marble or porphyry and then fift it through very fine searce observe that the quantity of these ingre- dients is not so fixed to the proportion have laid do yn but that you may put in more or less of them at discretion accord- ing to the depth or degree of the colour ou desire if the carmine is to be redde hey put more arnatto if more of crims on they use more cochineal but all hem are to be pulveriz ’ separately ani he grain of cohan or dyers red is first boil alone and the others all together all bove ultramarine take half pound of lapis-lazulis and put it upon red hot coals and here let it stay till it be all over as red as tha coals themselves then quench it in very strong vinegar and grind it upon por- phyry or any other stone that ’ very hard vith rectified brandy the more you grincl the finer will be your ultramarine leu lie upon the porphry or in any vessel ill you have made the pastel with which thiet lapis is to be incorporated for the making of this take quarter of pound of bee-wax quarter of pound of turpentine the same quantity of rosin and the same of linseed-oil melt the whole together over slow fire and when begins to boil pour it into glaz ’ pot this is the paste of ultramarine of which take quantity equal to that of the lapis and knead it together upon the por- hyry or marble when they are well in- corporated leave them for one night and afterwards to bring out the ultramarine which which is in this paste pour clear water upon it and knead it with your hands as paste is kneaded and the uitramarine will ime out for the receiving of which place porringer or other proper vessel under bur hands let it settle in this water you see the ultra marine at the eottemn of another take four ounces of linseed-oil four ounces of new bee-wax four ounces the litharge of silver one ounce of ro- one ounce of mastic in drops four unces of burgundy-pitch two drams of frankincense and one dram of dragon ’ blood beat small each of the dry ingre- ients in mortar separately then heat ie linseed-oil in an earthen pan till it mmers then put in your other ingredi- nts one after another letting the dragon ’ blood be the last and stirring the whole boût continually with stick this your aste will be done enough when it sticks to our fingers like glow at which time put on your lapis-lazuli having before-hand made it red hot

another lake take shreds of scarlet and boil them in lye made with old lees of wine or with calein ’ tartar this lye has the property of separating the dye from the scarlet-shreds when it has boil ’ long enough take it off and put in coche- neat powder mastic and little roach- allum boil the whole again then strain it through fine bag twice or thrice quite hot the first time the bag must be squeez ’ with two sticks from top to bottom then take out the grofs matter remaining in the bag and wash it well strain the liquid matter which you pressed out with the sticks again through the bag and you will find or the sides of the bag paste which spreac upon paste-board or divide into little por- tions upon paper and let it dry lake columbine take three pints of the finest distillc vinegar and pound of the finefts brasil of fernambuca which cut in smal pieces and steep in the vinegar for aboves month at the least the longer the better afterwards seeth the whole in balneo maria till it

cuttle-fish no make fine purple-colour of the gross part or sediment of lake-columbine besides that made with carmine for oil and water colours take the sediment of lake columbine which falls to the bottom of the vial which is the bone of the cuttle-fisb let it dry and grind it there is nosine lake so lively if you mix it with lake you will give the lake more strength and vi- gour lilly-green take the blewest flowers of lillies separate the tops of them which are silky and save only them for the rest is of no use and pull out the yellow fibres bruise in stone mortar the flowers you have pick ’ and when you have done that well throw three or four spoonfuls of water upon them more or less according to your quantity of flowers but you inust first dissolve à little allum and very little gum arabic in the water after- wards grind the whole together very well then strain it through coarse linnen- cloth and putting this juice in shells dry it in the air another way after you have picked and cleanse the flowers bruised and put alumi water to them as just now said throvi lpon them little quick-lime in powder in the manner they sugar sallet it haf the property to change their colour anc to purify them afterwards press out the juice into shells another and better way rruise allum and grain of avignon and mix them together with water then boil the whole upon the fire or upon hot ashes till the water be yellow nexti bruise the lilly-flowers in mortar and pour upon them little of this yellowi water according as you would make thef green lighter or darker afterwards strain the juice through bag or cloth made of goat ’ hair for linnen takes all the co- lour and pour it into large shells which set full in the sun for if they are placed in the shade the green becomes mouldy and glewy another take leaves of lris mince or chop — them very small and put them into glass or delft vessel or which is better into into brass or copper pot with powder illum and quick-lime let the whole rot together for ten or twelve days and then being rotten press it into shells for that ae blue colour may become green it that the flowers putrify the green ls darker and more lively when only the leaves are bruised and pressed immediately without letting them rot after having strewed powdered allum upon thent another with violet-flowers green of the leaves of march vio- lets is made in the same way but you must have greater quantity of them and this green is darker than that of the iris but observe that instead of lime you may put the grain of avignon or dyer ’ yellow bruised with allum tis much better than lime for changing the blue into green green may likewise be made with the flowers of pansies in the same manner sap-green take small red seeds of amomum and fill hog ’ bladder with them putting in little allum let it hang up in room some time and the seed corrupting will change into this sort of green else take buckthorn berries beat them in amortar and throw to them little pow- dered allum then squeeze out the juice and putting it in bladder tie it close and hang it up this green will harden in thei bladder dutch-pink is generally made with spanisb-white and the grain of avignon or dyer ’ yelloo but it changes when made of those things tis better therefore to make it of white-lead or ceruse which must be ground very fine and temper ’ upon por- phyry of which it must be taken with wooden spattle and let dry in the shady part ofa room afterwards take the grain of avignon or dyer tellow beat it to powder in amarble mortar with wooden pestle and boil it with water in leaded earthen pot till about third or more is consumed strain this decoction through linnen-cloth and put in it the quantity of two or three hazel-nuts of allum to keep it from changing its colour when it is dissolv ’ temper the white with this de- coction and bring it to the form of pretty thick pap of which kneading it well be- tween your hands make little balls or cakes and put them to dry in very airy room when they are dry dilute them again with the same decoction and put them again to dry and thus do three or four times ac- zording as you would have the pink light- er or darker letting it dry very well each time observe that the juice or decoc- tion inust be hot when you temper the paste with it and that another decoction must be made when the first is turn ’ and corrupted taking care not to touch it with lron or steel but to use wooden spattle the right use of allum he best way to use ailum in lilly- green and other compound-colours which change without this mineral salt is to beat it pretty smnall and put it in little water upon the fire for otherwise it will never dissolve weli this water you sprin- kle on your flowers or juices of colours but the less allum the better because it burns when there is too much to purisy vermillion innaber or vermillion being made of mercury and sulphur it must be clean- sed from the impurities it has contracted from these minerals which darken its lus- tre and make it turn now this purgation is done in the following manner grind cinnaber in stone with pure water upon porphyry then put it in glass or delft-vessel and let it dry afterwards put urine- f to it and mix them in such manner that the urine penetrate all the cinnaber and cover it let the whole settle and the cinnaber being at the bottom turn out the urine and add fresn to it leaving it all the night and continue to change the urine for four or five days till the cinna- ber be well purg ’ after that pour upon the cinnaber whites of eggs well beaten with fair water and so that the water co- ver the whites mix the whole together with hazel-stick and let it settle change the liquor twice or thrice as before and always keep the vessel close stopt to keep out the dust which makes the cinnaber turn or change and when you would make use of it temper it with gum-water for that will not change it another wax grind the cinnaber already in pow- der upon porphyry with children urine or with brandy and let it dry in the shade if you would take off its darkness and make it of brighter red infuse in brandy or in urine little saffron and with this liquor grind the cinnaber direction for the making very fine burnishd ggld the wood of the frame or of any other piece which you would gild inust be extremely smooth and to give it farther polishing rub it over with the ear of sea-dog then smear it over twice or thrice with glew made of the clippings of white glove-leather and put on nine or ten lays of white when- it is quite dry sub it over with shave-grass to make it smoother and finer next warm little glew over the fire with water in which dip piece of very fine linnen first made very clean and pass it over the whiter- then apply two or three lays of gold-co- lour and more if it has not colour enougha when ’ tis perfectly dry rub it stoutly with dry linnen-cloth till it glitters then pass large pencil dipt in the strongest brandy that is to be had over the gold-cc- our and let your leaf-gold be ready cut- pon the leather-cushion to lay on as soon you have pass ’ the pencil over and when it is dry polish it with dog ’ tooth to make glove-glew take pound of glover ’ clippings put thein to steep in water some time then boil them in kettle with twelve quarts of water till the water be consum ’ to two quarts then strain ii through linnen cloth into new earthen pan to know whether the glew be strong enough try when it is quite cold and has got its consistence ifit be stiff and firm un- der the hand to make white for the ground gm he glew being made take white chalk and reduce it to powder with knife or grind it upon marble melt the glew and make it very hot then take it off the fire and put sufficient quan- tity of white in it to make it as thick as pap leave it to steep for half quarter of an hour and then stir it about with bristle- brush take some of this white and put more giew to it to make it brighter for the first and second lay which must be applied by beating with the end of the brush mind that you let each lay dry well before you put on another if ’ tis wood you work on you must put on dozen if it is thick paper six or seven are suffi- cient this done take water dip soft brush in it and draining it with your fingers rub your work with it to make it smoother when your brushi is full of white you must wash wash it again and change the water too when it is too white you may likewise sometimes make use of wet linnen-rag in lieu of the brush your work being very even let it dry and when it is so rub it with shave-grass or à bit of new linnen-cloth to make it soft and free to make ground on which to gild and sil- ver in another manner take quarter of pound of very choice and fine bole armoniac that sticks upon the tongue and is greasy to the touch dissolve it in water and then grind it adding the bigness of fil- berd of lead-ore and the bigness of pea- of candle-tallow which prepare thus melt it then throw it into cold water -- and finger it about in the water and it will be fit for use the bigness of pea is enough for one grinding as you grind you may add little soap- sud to the bole armoniac when this com- position is ground put it in fair water which change from time to time in order to preserve it when you would use it temper it with melted glew somewhat warm and if the glew be as strong as that you have whiten ’ with add third part of water and mix- it it with the bole armoniac to the consis- tence of cream then apply it with pencil upon your work putting three or four lays and letting each lay dry very well before you apply another when it is all dry before you gild or silver it rub it à little with sost linnen-rag to lay on the gold and silver set the piece you would gild or silver over in reclining posture and wet any one place with pencil dipt in fair water then lay on your gold having cut it before upon leather-cushion it must be taken up with cotton or large pencil when all is gilded let it dry but not in the sun or in the wind and when it is dry enough polish it with dog ’ tooth to know whether it be dry pafs the tooth little over some places if it does not slide easily but tears the work off it is sign it is not dry but on the other hand take care it be not too dry for this makes it harder to po- lisn and takes away from its lustre in very hot weather three or four hours are sufficient to dry it but sometimes it re- quires day and night to deaden gold make fine lively red with red- lead little vermillion and the white of an egg well beaten grind all together upon marble and put some of it in the deep places with very fine- pencil to dedden silver take ceruse and grind it with wa- ter then temper it with fish or glove-glew the first is the best tis applied with pencil on the placcs to be deaden to make shell-gold and sbell-silver lay leaf-gold more or less accord- ling to the quantity you would make upon very clean marble grind it with new or clear honey till it be extremely soft under the grinding stone then put it in glass of fair water and stir it about and change the water till it remains clear get penny-worth or so of strong water put your gold in it and let it steep there two days then take it out and the strong water may serve again the method is the same sor silver when when you would lay either of them of you must temper them with water littl gummed and to sleek and smooth them th better let it be soap-sud tis proper als to put under the gold wash of gall-stone twill appear the finer for it you inust lay but tle least geld and sil ver that can be uron pieces in miniature excepting for fillets and girdles becaus this looks affected and gives them gaud theatrical air some some general instructive lessons for the art of drawing the ingenious author of the preceeding little but valuable treatise has laid down several rules for delineating or copying pictures or prints by such as could not draw knowing very well that the performance of the former would be very deficient without the practice of the lattera and he recommends it as the surest way to excel in that charming art of painting in miniature of which he has so freely and in- genuously given such fulland plain instructionsa it is to be admired that most persons from their infancy have fondness for pictures and children love to busy themselves with draw drawing colouring and handling pencil but this fondness for the generality wears off by degrees and is by most quite neglected the chief reason of which as presume is the trouble and pains they apprehend will attend the acquisition thereof it is certain ’ that every one is not endued with disposition or natural inclination to that ingenious art nor can it be attain ’ by labour and pains without genius but such as find them lelves disposed should by all means come to resolution to attempt the practice thereof parents therefore would do well to watch and observe diligently the inclination of their children and finding that by instinct they shew natural genius and capacity for ingenuity when of their own accord they will take delight in drawing shadow- ing and finishing any thing they attempt to copy and seem to take pride in their performances they should by all means be encouraged and be instructed by good master in the best manner in the funda- mental rules and precepts requisite to be known in the progress and practice of- either drawing designing or painting it frequently happens that bright genius an artist born has no opportu- nity to receive the instructions of master or is by distance in the country de- prived of the conversation with artists nd ingenious practitioners his only way then to furnishi himself with such books that may guide him in his pursuit after that knowledge he so fondly aims at and for the benefit of such these lessons are inten- ded not doubting they will meet with the same encouragement and reception by the ingenious as the preceeding work viz the art of painting in miniatare has done so which fourth edition have added these instructive leslons for the art of drawing briefly plain and casy as possible ii such as intend to make themselves compleat in the art of drawing should first learn the principles of geometry and perspective and thereby inform their minds of true symetry and proportion this being subject to be met with in books wrote by skilful artists for that purpose shall for brevity sake omit enlarging upon it the common rules for beginners are commonly to draw the particular members of the bodies of men and first of all the face or head is attempted by drawing an oval or the shape of an egg with the several dimensions of the cross by which learner may understand the better to ex- press the turnings and motions of the face in the different attitudes hereafter exem- plifyed to this oval for the head or face belong the eyes eye-brows nose mouth anot ears and to place them in their propek situations the cross is drawn for thal purpose after you have formed an oval draw perpendicular down the middle this cross again in the middle with diametrical line which you divide in five equal parts each being the breadth of one eye this is called the ocularline on which you place the eyes and is with the perpendiculara which goes from the top of the forehead through the middle of the nose mouth and chin called the cross upon which thef eyes nose mouth and ears are to bej placed in their proper situations as you may observe in fig but for the better apprehension of such as are unacquainted with the use of the cross in the oval ors with the many variations of the same as in turnings and motions of the head an experiment has been found to make the use of the crofs more plain and intelligible which is this have piece of wood turned in the shape of an egg as in fig then draw line from point to point lengthways through the midst of the egg as in fig divide this in two equal parts by cutting right angle as you see fig having drawn the eyes nose mouth in their proper place you may by the position of the egg see the declination or inclination of faces and according to the position of fig you will see it fronting turning the lgg or oval little from the left to the right the straight perpendicular of the cross will change and present itself in an arch as in fig ac- cording to which you project the nose beyond the round of the oval and place the rest of the members of the face in their proper lines as in fig the same is to be observed in turning the figure of the oval the contrary way as in fig again the oval inelining downward the cross will appear as in fig and the face looking down as in fig the oval being turned backwards the crofs will change again as in fig and face drawn according to thole lines will appear like fig after this manner you may form variety of faces except those which are sideways which are commonly drawn by means of perpendicular as you see in fig upen which vou place the forehead nose mouth and chin let them be in what disposition they will see fig are the necessary rules for design- ng or drawing face which if well ob- served and practised will in little time furnisn learner with lively ideas to draw faces with good judgment and give them masterly strokes and touches of which otherwise by meerly drawing or copying after prints he would have been unacquaint- having advanced and mounted the first step and the young practitioner is well grounded in drawing the oval andj face he may then exercise himself to copyl with great care and diligence after goodf draughts and prints the former being the most proper for such as intend to exer- cise the art of painting and the latter fori such as propose to practice etching or graving beginning with such as are easy and going forwards to such as are more dif- ficult and having arrived to some perfection in this he may adventure to copy after paintings and to contract large pictures into small observing due proportion and by diligent practice he will accustom him- self to guefs well and acquire free and sure hand in designing next to this young practitioner may venture upon copying after figures of plail- ter of paris which is more difficult than either drawing after prints or paintings and shall be more fully treated of in its pro¬ per place the best patterns to draw or copy after is life itself or all natural things here an artist has large field to range in and he need never be idle but may always find innume rable subjects to improve his talent which can not be better done than by dili- gence and application now come to the practice of the art of drawing itself and first of drawing after draughts prinits or pictures you must arst of all observe to fix your principal in proper light so as to see it distinct and plain placing it at proper distance accor- ding to the largeness of the picture or draught vou design to copy putting it straight before you and not flat for then you would see it foreshorten the paper you draw upon fix five or six double on board holding that on your knees with which you elevate it as high as you would have it thus you will the better compare your draught with the principal before you which otherwise in case your draught lay flat you could not do so well thus being fixed for to begin your piece guess firstthe middie of the picture or whatever you intend to copy after and make mark with your coal in the middle on your paper- from this mark you will guels at the pro¬ per distances of the figures dispersed in the pieces if there be more than one and by taking heed of the capital strokes with free and slight touches you will soon see whether the position of your figures be just leaving the small breakings or partings to the next drawing and thus by patience and practice you will not only readily but also judicioussy attain with delight to you purpose having made rough sketch examin whether the disposition and actions of the figures answer those in the princi pal before you correct and amend suc parts as you see amiss by adding or taking off ’ till you find it answer you purpose and having made thus rough sketch you may proceed and draw it neater and better ob serving the various turnings that represen themselves either in the actions or drapery taking heed not to make the first sketch worse or spoil it by being about to make in better which may soon happen if due cari is not taken in preserving that disposition you approved of before and having thus the second time drawn your sketch over with charcoal examine and correct it after the principal and suffer not fault to pass without correction for it will be more for your honour to make one good draught than an hundred without observation or judgment in this case it is proper for an artist to divert himself between whiles by reading mufick or looking over of prints then taking fresn view of his performance and examining it he may discover fault he did not see before in drawing after figures of plaister of paris you must choose proper light the room you draw in should be large and iave light northwards so high that the jhade which your figure makes upon the bround be equal or little less than the height of your figure you are to draw after you may also draw conveniently by the lamp which some artists prefer before day-light because the shades appear more strong and sharp for this purpose they hang lamp at convenient height well pro- vided with oil and divers wicks and to prevent the light spreading itself too much but remain more constant they put some oil paper through which the light can- not shine behind it and thereby it spreads the stronger upon the model they copy set yourself from the figure you are to draw three times as far as it is high in such manner that your eye may in straight line behold the model hanging plumb-line before it and having drawn perpendicular line on your paper you ob- serve what comes either on the one side or other to your view and then make rough sketch of the position of the figure in the best manner you are able what have here said of drawing after plaister of paris paris by the lamp is not to be observen in general for as it casts strong and hari shades they are judged not so natural an sweet as those caused by the light of day and are therefore not approved of by th generality of experienc artists and case they do draw by the lamp they pu frame with oil paper between the mei del and the light and thereby break tha harshness of the shade you must set alsi white or gray paper behind the model that you may perceive the reflexions the better vi such as would make further progres and improvement in drawing must ne cessarily study anatomy especially as far it relates to the muscles an artist having the fundamental knowledge in this study will soon apprehend the regular motion the members in the human body wher otherwise he will be in the dark and noi able to give any reasen or distinction why this or that muscle is in either this or thai position swelling or contraction the muscles which are the principal cause of the changeable motions or postures of the whole body are chiesly these those be- hind the hips those of the loins of the back those of the throat the muscles of the shoulder those of the breast beginning at the nipples ind ending at the small of the belly all he motions and changes of which may be observed from the life to which refer the practitioner but before he attempts this he will do well to draw first after anatomical figures many of which are extant in cop- per-plate prints and then after such as are cast in plaister of paris by which means and the reading of anatomical lectures upon the muscles he soon will form right judgment and idea in drawing his figures to perfection and in their regular postures and motions vii ature or the life is compleat in all things and to imitate the meanest production of nature requires à masterly hand this may invite us to chuse her for our pattern and chief object to draw after this can not be better put in execu- tion than for to chuse company of inge- nious ycung men with whom young beginner jointly may spend one or two days in week under the instruction of an able master to draw after life that is to say after naked strong and robust man of broad shoulders fair breast very well muscled thick thighs long legs and of proportionable size and having put this your model in the posture you have agreed on and furnished thei room with proper light such as has been described under the nfth article yot proceed to copying every one to his besi skill without despising one another ’ per- formance but rather instructing and encou- raging each other with modesty and gooc manners for standing actions the person drawn by is commonly placed on the ground but when sitting or lying it will be proper to have him placed on table at conve- nient height viii it is customary for beginners as well as able masters to draw with charcoal it being the easiest rubbed out again in cafe of fault others make use of black-lead with which they draw the outlines and after- wards finish their pieces either with crayons or other things they are used todraw with- but this is more fitter for experiene ’ mas- ters than young practitioners the several ways made use of in finish- ing draught depends upon the choice of the artists some use red chalk others black chalk others draw with pencil which is called wafhing and is done with several sap-colours as indian ink bistre or chimney soot of wood smoke ground in- ground red chalk and the like others again finish their pieces with writing pens which way is the most tedious and not to be recomniended but to such as in- tend to practice graving on copper-plates some use pens made of reeds and many great masters have drawn figures with them in bold strokes some chuse charcoal dipp ’ in linseed oil but this must be used quickly and readily and is only fit for large things others make use of tobacco-pipe clay wherewith they draw on blue or other co- loured paper and heighten the lights with white chalk of this tebacco-pipe clay are also made crayons or pastils of various colours with their different shades and they are thus done take tobacco-pipe clay and witha little water temper it with what colour you please work it well toge- ther roll it into pastils and lay them on clean paper to dry some will put gum or size in the water but then the crayons commonly prove hard and become useless these are the common methods practiti- oners make use of in finishing their draughts most of them chuse paper some indeed prefer parchment and other things but white paper has been approved of by most artists for sketching hatching and washing with all sorts of water-colours crayons indeed are best managed on blue or any other coloured paper learners should in drawing afterk draughts follow the manner of their principal that in so doing they may bel accustemed to it all their life-time if you hatch with pen take heed to avoid scratching endeavour to make the strokes free and bold beginning from the fine or sharp end to the broad some flat and equal shades must be drawn with equal hatches let them be sine or coarse in drawing with crayons hold your pas- tils straight forwards and they will not so soon become blunt for turning them be- veen your fingers they will wear and yet keep their pcint continvally so that you may draw whole draught without scrape- ing your pastils rousling is also practised by some and differs not much from hatching only to make it look close and blended one in ano- ther it must be dosled with some cotton fixed in goose quill when in this man¬ ner you begin to shadow your draught do it first faint smooth and even so as it may appear as if washed wich pencil then you shade your draught in the darkest places with hatchings in graceful and masterly manner thus by hatching and dosling the one upon the other you will accustom your- self to masterly hand in drawing this sort of dosling or hatching is done with either red or black chalk instead of cot- ton some make use of hair pencil that is inged blunit at candle as much as this manner of drawing is admired by some can not recommend it for it makes the workmanship hard stiff and occasions breaking in the slat parts except it be in sinall and curious piecas the custom of great masters has been to use but one thing in their hands at once oy which they have compleated the draughts without using cotton or the likz however if one designs to make something curious and nice the afbresaid maaner of dosling will not be amiss only would not have the practitioner accustom himself to it altogether if one draws counterseits especially upon coloured paper let him smooth the edges of the heightenings with the like coloured paper roll ’ up to sharp point at one end with this ou may sweeten or soften the edges so as to appear neither too hard nor sharp there is singular manner some artists use of washing performed with pencil dipt in ink or any other sap-colour and so pencil ’ on all sorts of either white or coloured paper they wash therewith in any draught the principal shades and afterwards work over them slightly with pen or black chalk this is geod masterly man- ner and looks exceedingly well in washing you must observe to lay on first the soit and faint shades smoothing the edges with clean pencil moistened littie with your tongue when this is dry go over the darker shades with deeper colour thus you preceed with third and fourth shade till you see your draught perfect always raking heed not to make ycur work too hard at first the faint shades especially on coloured paper must be imperceptibly lost since the heightening with white will help you there are two properties necessary to be understood in the art of drawing the one is general the other particular all things composed consist of certain parts which together carry on correspondence- they make general mass or lump and are by our sight distinguissied either in general or particular if then vou draw either after print picture or life ob- serve the general form represented to you which consists of several parts examine whether it be round square triangular lonc or short and this is best observable with an half shut eye without observing the parts as are contained in the general for example suppose head compleatly finished the circumferent strokes consti- tutes utes the general mass the eyes nose mouth are the particulars contained in the general the question is whether this face may be known by the parts in particular or all the parts in the circumfe- rent strokes shall answer this with the following examples suppose two faces be drawn with something that may be easily wip ’ off very like each other wipe the circumferent stroke of one face clean away so that no- thing remain but the sinall parts as the eyes nose mouth and you will pre- sently find that the likeness of the faze is gohe or ifabout those particular parts you draw anocher circumferent line differing from the former you will behold another likeness in the face much differing from what it had before by this it appears plainly that the parts themselves do not represent themselves in their being before they are joined to their general out-strokes as these particular parts are observed in the general of the head the same is to be taken notice of in the arms hands legs and feet for although in respect to the whole body they are but parts yet in theinselves they are general to the parts they contain as the arm has its muscles the bending of the elbow the hands have their fingers and fingers again their members and so on in the saie manner is the knowledge of things hidden in the generality of all for let man whom we know very well be at some reasonable distance so that we can not know him by some small parts as by his eyes whether brown or gray neither his great or small nose his red or pale face nor any other small part of his body not- withstanding we shall knowthis man at this distance by what means by means of the general for the-general lump seen by vou even when his back is turned upon you will make you presently know him xi now come to say something concerning the nature and virtue of lights and shades there are no things in nature which can be distinguished by us in lesser or further distance from us nor can it be expressed by the art of drawing without this knowledge for without dark and light nothing resembles what it ought to do for it is that which gives being and re¬ presentation to all things to prove this draw counterfeit upon white paper with black chalk when finished it is like the person and judged to be well drawn here it may be asked what correspondence has black chalk wherewith you made your shades and the white paper by which the light is represented with the original that is life to which answer it is not the black chalk nor the white paper nor any single strokes drawn but it is the effect of- the lights and shades in their proper places that represent life itself to us for it is im- possible that either round circle or spot of flat colour should represent globe except the roundness is given it by light and shadow xii young practitioners or learners should by all means use themselves to the best manner of drawing that is to finish their work plain smooth neat and ’ easy to blend the shades and lights so as to be lost the one in the other this they must endeavour by indefatigable pains and although in the beginning it will seem dif- ficult and their performance displeasing yet let not this discourage them from pursuing their aim for none are born masters andhe that never did do ill can not expect ever to- do well one day brings on another and with it some amendment till you arrive to perfection which will be reward for all the labour and pains you have taken in the acquisition of this charming art xiii picture or drawing that wants per- spective is locked upen as irrational and dead wheresore shall inform the young practitioner what it is and how to attain the knowledge of that science so necessary in designing and painting perspective is that which causes all things contained in draught or picture to come florward or sink backward and causes them from the first to the last to stand in their due and proper places as also the vacuum or emptineis between body and body to no from you or come forward naturally to the eye as though it were accessible and as real perspective shews the distance which every arch or pillar has the one after the other as also the standing of peo- ple in their proper and singular places so likewise in draught or picture by the diminution of light and dark the distance must be observed agreeable to the appro¬ priated declination and every draught or picture whether after nature or plaister of paris you must well observe what appeareth forwards or backwards and how one thing follows another this is one of the most difficult studies belonging to the art of drawing and painting wherefore practitioner ought to inforin himself in time either by the instruction of mas- ter or by reading of books of perspec- tive xiv having gone through the principal properties belonging to the art of drawing it will now be requisite to sum up what has been said for making your work compleat and perfect in your rough sketch observe to bring in good spirit free and pleasing to the first view correct the first rough draught in the drawing it over again and accustom yourself in representing the shadows and touches with the coal in order to be cer- tain in the position of your figures having compleated your design as far as relates to the use of charcoal then draw with either your pen or pencil with dili- gent care the qut-lines endeavouring to keep or bring in all the beauties comeli- ness and gentility of the figures taking particular care and diligence to obselve and keep the bendings and motions of the body and the easy displaying of the folo- ings of garment in their comeliness and genteel disposition for it often happens that by small bending whole part of pigure is entirely spoil this is fault youth are much addicted to by observing those sinall bendings too much which they commonly make toobig and thereby de- prive piece of that beauty which with little precaution they might have preserved and this puts me in mind to caution young practitioners not to rely so much on the particulars but the general as have observed already in the xth article for in being too attentive in finishing and obser- ving the little and insignificant parts you lose that which ought to make the most shew of masterly performance therefore let your chiefest care be to observe and finish the general parts to pe rfection for the small or particular ones may be put in afterwards with more ease this is an article highly necessary for young practiti- oners tobe instructed in but to the shame of their teachers most of them are kept ignorant in this particular thus some painters will take abundance of pains to draw face near at hand with all its de- formities if it has any as pits of the small pox scars spots and the like when otherwise at convenient distance they might have the general with the particular in more agreeable appearance than it then gepresents itsell and that with less pains and trouble but this is the case with many pretenders in the art of painting that they can not draw portraiture to be any ghing like except they bring in all the marks wrinkles when vou draw with red or black chalk take heed your strokes be not hard or too sharp especially in the light parts in the strong shady parts you may carry bold stroke always observe that in the shadow- ing of your piece the strokes lose and va- rnish away so that one might judge as if you had finished your piece without draw- ing the circumference or out lines for thus it will be agreeable to nature where no stroke can be seen this you may ob- serve in picture as well as in good prints or drawings it will happen that in drawing between white and white and against the light stroke or qut-line must be drawn for to express the draught and distinguish it from the ground especially when drawn on white paper but this you should endeavour to shun as much as possible and not do it except necessity compel you to it and you have no other means left to avoid it but as can not here speak of all the causes incident to this case will only exemplify one for the better apprehension of young practitioners by the two faces in the op- posite print the face as you plainly perceive is drawn compleat with an out-line stroke and the face only represents the shadows that are underneath the nose mouth the question is whether an error is com- mitted in the face which might by the out-line of the face be amended for my part say no but on the contrary ob- serve in the face ba singular curiosity and beauty where white against white makesy termination without circumferent stroke apprehending well this example you will improve it in your drawings and gain thereby singular and accomplished man- ner what have said on this head is to be observed with due caution for as rough sketch only consists in circumferent lines or strokes nevertheless dexterity gives it singular beauty you may by this rule ap- prehend how to work on coloured paper where by the heightnings you may do much and save many strokes you are obliged to express on white paper xv now come to the finishing part here you must not childishily or apishly imi¬ tate stroke for stroke but observe the in- tent of the master in his expressions dis- positions shades and lights in his figures if vou draw face after picture or aster life observe the passions and phfi- ognomy thereof take notice by what strokes touches turnings shades or otherwise such face is made to look sorrowful or merry crying or laughing old or young wild or modest foul or clean homely or beautiful and by obser- ving this you will not only follow the same strokes strokes touches and shades as near as possible to express the same actions and passions but also you will retain the same in your mind and understand it with well grounied knowledge when you begin to finish your draught take heed you inake not the shades at first so hard or deep as they must be when fi- nissed you may easily bring them to be darker but net so to make them lighter acquire good judgment in disposing your shades so that they may fling things either backwards or forwards for whatever vou draw with let it be red lead indian ink black chalk you must express one extream dark or light and therefore accus- tom yourself ’ from your beginning to draw to shadow very light and sweet faint and even and bring in the perspective of dark- ness as much as possible and by observing this vou will find yourself seldom deceived but gain honour and applause by your per- formance be careful to keep your draught in one even and equal condition so that it may not appear as if composed of dark and light spots- but let the lights and shades cor- respond and agree together the lesser dark with the faint and the faint with stronger lights otherwise your work will presently incline to hardness and stiffness which if you examine life you will never meet with there when you draw on coloured paper after print or draught observe the evenf likeness of dark and light keeping the great parts of lights and shadows and the imall intermixt parts in the same manner that the greater may always have the pre- dominancy over the less shall conclude with advising voung practitioners to observe in all their perfor- mances true symetry and proportion es- pecially in all the parts of human figure let them first well be master of every par- ticular for it is the or alphabet which when well learned is easily joined together into words and he who can de- lincate well the eyes nose mouth ears yc will readily form well proportioned face and after he has used himself to draw hands arms legs he will easily cempile whole body there are indeed several eminent pain- ters who have in their writings endea- voured to teach young practitioners the art of true proportion and symetry by geometrical and perspective rules how to form an oval out of circle perpendicular into square according as the one or other object is representing itself to ones eyes but as this way of proceeding is ve- ry tedious and likely to deter young be- ginners fertil genius will like many other great masters advance in his perfor- mances by more easier steps and form true idea in his conception of nature in relation to the true symetry of the human body it is to be admtred that from the dimension of toe or finger the whole corporeal substance may be de- monstrated so that three sculptors in three different places having agreed on the true measure of the height may work on one statue and when the limbs are brought and fixed together will make perfect image according to art man that is well proportioned is eight times as high as his head that is from the hair of his forehcad to his chin his face is three noses long and his foot is one fifth of his length it would seem incredible to some people did their own experience not convince and satisfy their curiosity without any cost or charge that thread which reaches three times about the end of the middle finger should be just so long as totake in the com- pass of ones wrist and that six times of that length is the measure about ones waste over the navel this may be easily tried by winding thread six times about the wrist and then measuring the waste thread which goes round ones fore- head will also reach from the chin behind the neck and it is remarkable that by ex- tending ones hands and arms as far as one can the two ends of the middle fingers will determine ones height and man placed in that posture will describe qua- drant whole centre is the privy parts also if man extends his hands and feet in the figure of st. andrew ’ cross and fixes one end of the compass to the navel and the other to the extream parts it will take the urmiost parts of the hands and feet in the same circie the length of the face and ones hand are equal as are the height of the ferehead the length of the nose the ears the thumb and the- stace frem under the nose to the chin lt is cbservable that all that is doubled is in true order on each side and all that is single in the middle of the body if man rests on one leg plumb line must fall frem over his forehead nose and navel to his feet if he sits he makes with his knees and back direct angle here can not omit à question viz what were the proportionable joints and features of the great colossus at rbodes the whole height whereof was foot does appear by this height that the trunk was zo foot wide the face long and his nose and thumbs each foot long from such like observations we may inform ourselves of many things in antiquity by comparing and calculat ing the dimensions of one part to the other and thus find out the true proportion the usefulness and use of prints rhat which now am about to treat ur on is concerning prints the invention whereof is alll ’ by all lovers of art and inge- nuity to be one of the happiest productions of latter ages prints are in our age arrivd to so high degree of perfection and good gravers have given us so many on all sorts of mat- ters tnat it may truly be said they are the depositories of all that is fine and curious in the world their origin was in the year and arose from one maso finiguerra gold- smith of florence who grav his plate when casting some off in melted sulphur he perceiv ’ that what came out of the meuld was mark with the same prints as his plate by the black which the sulphur had taken from his graving he try to do as much on silver plates with wet paper by rouling it sinnothly witha rouler which also succeeded this novelty tempted baccio baldini goldsmith of the same city to try whether he could do the same and his success oc- casion ’ him to engrave several plates ¬ sandro boticello invention aud design ant upon this andrew mantegna who was rome at that time set about engraving some of his own pieces the knowledge of this invention getting into flanders martin of antwerp then famous painter engrav ’ abundance of plates of his cwn invention and sent se- veral prints into italy which were markd thus vasari in the life of marce antonio painter gives an account of the greatest part ofhis subjects of which there was one amongst the rest the vision of st. antony that pleasd michael angelo then very young so well for the invention of it that he colour ’ it after martin ol antwerp albert durer began to appear and gave the world an infinite number of fine prints as well in wood as in copper all which he sent to venice to be sold marco antonio who happen ’ at that time to be there was so ravish ’ with the beauty of these prints that he copy ’ six and thirty of them which represented our saviour ’ passion and these copies were receiv ’ at rome with so much the more admiration by how much the more they were finer than the originals at the same time hugo du carpi an italian painter of mean capacity but of wit apt for inven- tion found out by means of several plates of wood the way how to make prints re- semble designs of claro ofcuro and some years after the invention of etching was dicover ’ which parmegiano soon made use of these first prints drew the admiration of all that saw them for their novelty and the skilful painters who work ’ for glory were willing to use them to spread their works over the world raphael among others employd the famous marco antonio to engrave several of his pictures and de- signs and those admirable prints were so renown ’ that they carryd the name of raphael through the world vast num- ber of gravers have made themselves famious since marco antonio in germany italy france and the low countries and have publish ’ as well by graving as etching an infinite number of prints on all sorts of sub- jects as well histories fables embleins devises medals animals landskips flow- ers fruits as in general all the visible productions of art and nature there is no body of what condition or profession soever but may profit very much by inspecting into prints divines philosophers soldiers travellers geo- graphers painters sculptors architects gravers lovers of the fine arts all that are curious in history or antiquity and in short all who having no particular profes- sion men of honour and fe adorn their minds with the ki those things that may rende more worthy of esteem it is not pretended that pers lig ’ to see all the prints that hav lish ’ to know how to profit by infinite number ofthem present so many different ideas to will rather confound than in those only who are born with clear genius who have bee some time to the sight of so ma things can make them profitab and see them all without confus every farticular man may subjects that are most proper fc may either refresn his memory of his judgment in which he sho rected by the inclination he has of his own goût and profession as for example nothing is ble to divines than prints whic the sacred history of the ol testament and every thing whic the exercise or the persecution mitive christians the antique lievo which in ma places the ceremony of the heathen short any thing that has relat own whether it be sacred or for philosophers all the demonstrative figures which relate not only to the ex- periments of phyfick but all that may en- crease their knowledge in natural things for those that are bred up to war the plan and elevation of fortity ’ cities the order of battles and books of fortification of which the demonstrative figures are the greatest part for travellers the particular views of palaces of cities and considerable places to prepare them for the things they are to see or to preserve the ideas of those they have seen for geographers the maps and plans necessary in their prosession for painters every thing that may strengthen them in their art as the antique pieces and those of raphael and caracci for the good geût correctness of design the dignity of manner for the choice of the hairs of the head the passions of the mind and the attitudes those of correg- gio for grace and delicacy of the fxpres- sions those of titian bassan and the lem- bards for the character of truth for the simplé expressions of nature and above all for the geût of landstips those of ru- bens fer the grandeur and magnificence of his invention and the artifice of claro oscuro in short those that tho ’ they may be defective in some particular part of them may yet have sometliing in thein singular and extracrdinary for the painters may draw considerable advantage from all the different manners of those that have gone before them who are as so many flowers fiom whence like the bees they may suck luice which incorporating with their proper substance will bring forth such works as are useful and agreeable for sculptors statutes basso relievos medals and other antique works those of raphael polidoro and the whole roman school for architects the books that concern their profession and that are full of demon- strative figures of the invention of their authors or copy ’ froin the antique for gravers collection of pieces of different manners as well graved as etch ’ this collection should also serve to shew them the progress of graving from albert durer to the gravers of our own times which will include the works of marco antonio cornelius cort mne caracci sade- lers pontius bolsvert goltius muler vos- terman vischer and great many more that have not named who had particular character and who by different ways strove all of them to imitate either nature when they did something of their own in- vention or pictures of different manners when when they only aimed at the faithfulness of imitation in comparing thus the works of all these masters they may judge which of them understood best the manage- ment of their tools of light and the usefulness of harmeny as it relates to claro ofcuro which of them in their operations reconciled delicacy and force best and in their productions were most senfible and exact that making good use of these lights they may have the laudable ambi- tion to equal or surpass these skilful masters for the curious in history and antiqui- ty every thing that has been engraven belonging to sacred or profane history the fable antique basso relievos the trajan andl antonine pillars the books of medals and stones engraved and several prints that may help them in the knowledge of those things they would know or to keerz those they know already in their memory in short for those that to be more happy and more gentleman-like would form their goût by the study of good things and have reasonable tincture of the fine arts nothing is more necessary than good prints- their sight with little refiection will readily and agreeably infori them of every thing that may exercise their reason and strengthen their judgment they may sill their memory with the most curious things of all times and all countries and in learning the different histories learn the several manners of painting they will judge readily by the facility with which they may open few leaves and so com- pare the productions of one master with those of another and by this means in spa¬ ring their time they will spare their ex- pence also for it is almost impossible to put the pictures of as many masters together in room as will suffice to form perfect idea of the work of each master and when at vast charge man has silled large chamber with ’ ictures of different manners he can not have above two or three of each which is not enough to ena- ble him to make à nice judgment of the character of the painter or the extent of his capacity whereas by means of prints one may easily see the works of-several masters on table one may form an idea of them judge by comparing them one with another know which to chuse and by practising it often contract habit of good taste and good manner especially if we do it in the company of any body that has discernment in these things and can distinguisn what is good from whât is but indifferent such as have any paffion for the fine arts take regular method in their collections they do it by the painters and their disci- ples in the roman school they place raphael michael angelo their disciples and their contemporaries in that of venice giorgione titian che bassani paols veronese tintoret and ocher venetians in chat of parma corregio parmegiano anc those that followed their goit in that of bologna the carracci guido diminichino albani lanfranco and guerchino in that of germany albert durer holben the lit- tle masters william baur and others in chat of flanders otho venias rabens vandike and those that practised their rules in the same manner they put the masters of the french school and those of other countries in their several classes others collect their prints by the gravers without respect to the painters others by other fashiions and indeed it is reasonable that every one fhould have liberty to do in this what seems to him to be usefal and agreeable tho ’ one may at any time and in any age benefit ones self by the sight of prints yet youth is more proper for it than any other part of man ’ life because memory is the gift of childhood and while persons are young they ought to make use of it as magazine to lay up things that may contribute towards forming their judg- merit if the ancients had had the same advan- tage in this as we have and if they had by means of the prints transmitted what they had done that was fine and curious to posterity we should have dist inctly known known abundance of things of which we have but confufed ideas in history we should see the stately monuments of mem- phis and babylon and the temple of jeru- salem which solomon built with so much magnificence we should make judgment of the building of athens corinth and old rome with mare grounds and with more certainty than we now can by the- poor remains that are left of them pau- sanius who lias made such an exact de- scription of greece would have accompa- nied his discouries with demonstrative figures which might have been handed down to us and we might have seen with pleasure not only the temples and pala- ces as they were in their perfection but we should also have inherited from the anci- ent workmen the art of good building tis for want of these means that the ma- chines of archimedes and the elder hiero are lost and the knowledge of dioscorides ’ plants as also of several finimals and of great many of the curious productions of nature which the studies and medita- tions of the ancients discovered bur not to trouble ourselves any longer in grieving for the loss of things which we can ’ recover let us profit ourselves by those prints that we have amongst us finis
