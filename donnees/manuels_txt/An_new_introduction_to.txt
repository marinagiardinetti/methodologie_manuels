PREFACE, by Way of Instruction.


As the Art of Drawing is not only an in


nocent and useful Amusement for Young Gentlemnen
and Ladies, but a a Qualification highly expedient if
not absolutely necessary for most Mechanicks; The.
order that they will find here carrefully observ'd, will
be the best Directions for their proper Progress.


You must not be too eager after new Transitions
from one Plate to another, but must dwell upon
each and never begin a second till you have in some
measure made your felt Master of the first. â€”
You must further be very flow in your first Opera
tions; Taste seldom produces any Thing Beautiful, or
correct; and ill Habits, when one contracted are the











most difficult Things in Nature to be renov'd.


You cannot look too often on you Originals; and
the length, Breadth and Similitude of each object before
you will require your utmost attention & observance:
and when once you are able to touch up a Piece through any
tolerable beauty: Practise in a short Time will make


you Expeditions and render your Labours Delighful.
