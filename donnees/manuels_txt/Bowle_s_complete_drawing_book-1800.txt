ruch parts as appear dark, diffinctly from thofe which are
faint or fmaller, the ftrong touches being what give fpirit to
the out-line, and when properly given, always denote a

And firtt of Hatening: carefully observe the Burin, or
manner in which the rokes of the original are laid, and
keep with exactncts the form, not to much regarding their
number; firft flightly making them all of a thicknets, and
after by various retouchings, frengthen them to the tone of
colour in your original, whether you ufe black or red chalk:,
or black lead; which may be ufed fingly or thus compound-
ed, working the fainter parts with black lead, and wive

Hrength with black chalk: or finithing your drapery, hair
and eyc-brows in this manner, and the fleth or naked with
fed chalk. This method ir beft for copying engraved prints,
which we principally recommend to beginners.
Next of Walhing or Shading with Indian Ink. Goexactly
over your out-line with a pen dipped in common Ink, with
clean ftale bread or India rubber, rub cut all remains of
your black lead; then mix your indian Ink, by rubbing it
in an earthen faucer with water, till it is pretty blact. Then
take another clean faucer and dip your pencil in the tLim
Ink, and with water mix it to the lighteit frade; as is aries
deepen it, where neceffary, till you come up to the Hrengtl
of your original. This method is molt proper to ufe in
drawing from mezzotintos or paintings.
Laftly of Crayons, beginning with black and white: take
blue or purple-coloured paper, and having ccattly formed
your out-line, begin on the fecond degree of your thades,
and with black chalk darken downwards; then take white
French chalk, to be had at all colour shops, and heighten
the lighter parts to a perfect white. In this manner all
paintings may be copied in their proper colours, by haring
different Crayons of each colour, from dark to light in due
gradations; and practifing by the preceding rule, rolling a
piece of paper to a point, and dezzeling or rubbing each co-
four on the paper when finithed, to prevent their coming off,
which yet will be tender, and shhould be kept behind a glats.
