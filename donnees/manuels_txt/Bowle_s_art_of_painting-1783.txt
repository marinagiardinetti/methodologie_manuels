The beft White for painting in Water-Colours,
is Flake Whife. Some recommend a White made
of Pearl and Cyffer-Shells, brought to an impalpable
Powder, called a Pearl White, which will mix well
with any Colour. If you afe Whice Lead, clarify

at: with White Wine Vinegar; after the Whise is
fettled,
pour off the Vinegar, and wath it with
Water, thus:: Put the Powder into a Glats of
ater, fir it and prefently pour the Water off while
it is white, into another clean Glafs, when it is

settled pour off the Water, and you will have an exe
cellent White; to which add as much Gum, as is
neceffary to give it a Gloss.
: It has been often noticed that White Lead will
turn black, if mixed with Water that comes from
Iron or Clay; to that in the Space of a Month or
TWo, you may perceive it; and it will alfo change
any Colour, with which it is mixed.
It is recommended by some to rake the Powder of
Egg- Shells, of the brighteft and whiteft Sort,
well ground with Gum-Water, to the State of
21i impalpaple Powder, to which add one twenrieth
Part of White Sugar-candy; others efteem it moff
when clarified in Spirits of Wine, and then ufe it
with Gum-Water.
It has been found by repeated Experience, that
3
this Egg-shell Powder is extremely ferviceable as 2
White in Water-Colours: and thatithis, and the
Oyfter-shell Powder rectified; and well bruifed, will
make an excellent Mixture with other Colours, to
keep them from changing.
A fine White for Water-Colours may he made
by diffolving Filings of Silver, or Silver Leat, in
Aqua-Fortis, evaporating the Aqua;Fortis, till it
appears like Chryffal in the Bottom of the Glass:
Decant the other Part of the Aqua-Fortis, and walls
the Silver four or five Times in pure Water, till it is
entirely cleaned from the Aqua-Fortis, drying it
for Ufe. It muft be afed with the Waters of Cum
and Sugar-candy.
A good Whire for Water-Colours proper for Mi-
slature is made thus: Take 2 Pound of the Shred-
dings

dings of Glove-Leather, and ffeep them in Water,
Boil them with twelve Quarts of Water, till it waltes
so two; ftrain it through a Linen. Cloth, into
 well-glazed earthen Pan: This is called CGlue
or Size, and proper to ufe with Colours in Candle-
Light Pieces; to know if this be ffrong enough,
feel if it is ftiff and firm under your Hand.
The Glue being melted, reduce fome White
halk to a Powder; and while it is hor, add fuch
2.
nantity of Chalk, as will bring it to the Con-
Liftency of a Pafte; leiring it fleep for a Quarter
of an Hour,, fir it with a Bruth made of Heg's
Briftles.
In order to make this Whire brighter, add more
Eylac. Be careful to obferve that every Layer be dry,
before you put on another. If you work upon Wood,
you muft put on a Dozen; but fix or feven is fuffi-
crent, if your Paper is thick. Afterwards dip a foft
13
aruth in fome Water, draining it with your Fin=
gers, ruh the Work with it, in order to make it the
Smoother. When your Bruth is full of White, you
muft wath it again, and alfo change the Water,
exhen it is too white. Or you may ufe a wet Linen
Rag. intlead of a Bruth,

In some Objects there may be seen a fhining, like
That of Gold; through Colours of Red, Blue, or
GGreen, such as some Sort of Flies, or Beetles, and
the Cansharides. This Grold Tranfparency may be
very welk imifared, by laying some Leaf-Gold on
the shaded Side of the Drawing, giving a little to the
light Side. To lay on the Gold Leaf, press it
Tmrooth and clofe with Cotton, after you have
walked it with trong Gum-Water. But Care muff
be taken that in laying on the Gum, you do not

exceed the Limits through which you would have
the Gold appear. In this Cafe, the Gold is only to

frine through the tranfparent Colour, which is to
be laid over. it.
As Leaf-Gold will not receive Water-Colours re-
fularly, it is necelfary to be provided with Water
of Ox-Gall; and with this Liquor to froke over the
Gold Leafs by which it will receive any Colour
you are defirous of laying over it, and will alfe
Tetain it.
In June and July, there may be found upon Rofe=
Trees, a Kind of Beetle, of a Gold and Green Co=
Jour, which may prove extremely serviceable in this
Kind of Painting; but in ufing your Gold, it will be
beft to polith it, in this Manner.
In Tome Manufcripts there may be feen Gold
Letters, which feem to rife above the Surface of
the Paper.
The Compofition which raifes them

is made of Vermilion, and the White of an Egzs
beat to the Confiffience of an Oil, and fixed 1o
The Paper with Gum Arabic: On this figurative
Letter, wath fome flrong Gum-Water, with 2
Camel’s Hair Pencil; lay on the Gold Leaf clote
with fome Cotton: and when dry, rub it again with
Cotton, and burnifh it with a Dog's Tooth; and
it will appear as if it was really caft in Gold.
There is alfo another Way of working in Gold,
which is performed by Shell-Gold (but then it muft
be pure, and not that brought from Germany,
which turns green in 2 few Days). Cover the
Shady Parts with Vermilion, before you ufe this
Gold; and when you have rectified it with Spirits of
Wine, lay it on; when dry, burnifh it as before
directed.
In laying on this Gold, it is beft to leave the
Lights without it, as it will appear to a much greater
Advantage, than if all the Object was covered: But
providing the whole Performance should chance to
be covered, the beft Way of fetting it off, is to trace

over the fhady Parts with Gall-Stone, or the 7ellow
made of French Berries (of which we shall treat
hereafter), heightened with Mlnium.
Having treated thus much upon Gold, we shall
now Speak of Yellows in general. Gambodge is, be-
youd doubt, one of the melloweff Colours Nature
has produced: It is of to mild a Temperature, that
when it is touched with any Fluid, it inftantly
diffolves; to that confequently if wants neither
gumming nor grinding: It is productive of a Va-
riety of the moft agreeable and pleafant Yellow
Fints, that Fancy or Art could ever imagine; it
vill generally fhade itfelf; though you will fome:
simes find in the Description of Flowers it requires
Felp.
Gall-Rone is a very rich deep Fellow, tending

towards a Brown. it is exceeding ufeful in many
Cafess needs but little gumiming or grinding; works

In a Quart of the preceding Lixivium, boil twwe
Ounces of French Berries gill the Liquor is of a fine
Fellow; strain it from the Yellow Berries, and
when cold it is fit for iIfe. To the Berries put 2
Pint of the Jame Lixivium, and boil it till the
Liquor is as Rrong as Gall-fones, with which
you may fhade any Yellows. This you may boil
till it comes to a Brown, and will, with the Addition
of a little Ox-Gall, ferve to fhade the Gold Leaf.
You may likewife make a Yellow, by infufing
Saffron in pure Water. When this is, steeped in
reclified Spirits of Wine, there is nothing higher;
but it is very apt to fy, unless it is high-gummed.
A good Fellow for the Illumination of Prints may
be extracted from the Roots of Cringer, which makes
a good Green, when mixed with tranfparent Verdi-
grife.
Thole Vellows, called Englifh and Dutch Pinks,
are made with French Berries ground to a fine Poty-
ter, and then boiled.
OR ANGE COLOUR.
This Colour is made of a Mixture of Vermilion
and Gambodge, the latter moft predominant; in
which you are prefented with a pleafant and service-
able Colour in painting Lillies, and allother Orange—
Colour Flowers.
R ED S.
Minium, or Red Lead, is a flrong heavy Co-
lour, Mr. Boyle has given us the following Di-
rections for preparing it Put four Ounces in

it has been thoroughly firred, pour off the Wa-
fer; and by a frequent Repetition of this, there

Will remain at the Bottom of the Glats a beautiful
Red when dry; which is to be ufed with Gums
Water. When the Colour has been thus prepared;
you muft not expect above twenty Grains to remain
Sut of four Ounces.
Carmine affords the brightelf and moft perfect
Crimson, and is the moft beautiful of all Reds; for
with this Colour and Lake you may make the Shades
25 ttrong as you pleafe. This Colour should never
be purchafed but by Day-light; for if it is not good,
it will but fpoil your Work.
Lake is a fine tran(parent Colour, not much in-
ferior to Carmine but in painting with Carmine on
That Part of the Print, on which the Light is fup-
pofed to ftrike, lay on fo light a Tint, as 15 fcarce
vifible; working it fronger as it orows darker, and
souch it in the darker Parts with Lake.
Lake may be bought at moft Colour-fhops ready
repared in Shells for Warer-Colours: But if you
are defirous of making it yourfelf, it is necefiary to
adhere to the following Directions.
Having prepared a Lixivium made with the Afhes
of Vine-Twigs, to three Pints of it, add a Pound of
the beft ground Brafil Wood, boil it till half the
Lixivium is evaporated, ftrain it off; boil it again
with the Addition of four Ounces of freth Brafil
ood, two Ounces of Cochineal, Half an Dunce
of Terra Marita, and a Pint of fair Water, let it
evaporate as before: Add half an Ounce of calcined
lum (reduced to an impalpable Powder) a Quarter
of 2 Drachm of Arfenick: diffolve them in it, by
stirring it with a Stick, when fettled ftrain it off.
To give this a Body, reduce two Cutle-fith Bones

If you would have this Lake redder, add fome of

nother Lake. Boil the Shreds of Cuperfine Scar-
let Cloth in a Lie made of the Afhes of burnt
Tartar, when fufficiently boiled, add fome Cochi-
eal, powdered Maftich, and Roche—Alum, boil this
again j while it is quite hot, ftrain it through a Bag
r
feveral Limes. The firft Time, the Bag muft be
Rrained from Top to Bottom, and the remaining
grofs Master being taken out, let the Bag be well
wathed; after this, ftrain the Liquor through the
Bag again, and you will find a Paffe remaining on
the Sides, which divide into small Cakes, and fet by
for ufe.
Another Lake. Steep four Ounces of the beft
Brafil Wood in a Pint and a Half of the fineft
diffilled Vinegar, for three Weeks at leaft, tho' the
longer it remains the better it is; feeth the Whole
in Balneum Marix, till it boils up three or four
Times; let it fettle for a Day or two, put it to an
Ounce of powdered Alum, and into a clean Pan with
the Liquor, let it remain for twenty-four Heurs;
heat the Compofition, and fir it till it as cold whern
it has ftood about twelve Hours, ffrain it, and add
two Cuttle-fish Bones, prepared as before.
A Liquid Colour of a very good Crimfon may
be made as follows. In twelve Ounces of pale ftale
Beer, boil one Ounce of ground Brafil Wood till the
Colour is as firong as you defire; frain it through a
Linen Cloth, and bortle it up for Ofe. If you want
to bring this Colour to a Body, take some dried Ox-
blood reduced to a Powder, and mix it with the
Colour.

We have the following Directions from Mir. Boyls,
for extracting a fine Crimfon from the Berry:bearing
Spinach, which, being preffed, affords a very agree-
able Juice; to which add a fourth Part of Alum,
boil it, and when cold it is fit for Ufe.
Or you may extract a very beautiful Red, from
the Red Beetreot, baked with a little frong Vine-
gar and Alum, when cold it is fit for tIfe.
Another Way to make a Crimfon Put twenty (or
more) Grains of bruifed Cochineal into a Gallipot,
with as many Drops of the Lne of Tartar, as will
make it give forth its Colour; add to this Mixture
about Half a Spoonful of Water, or more, and you
evill have a very agreeable Purple; reducing fome
Alum to a very fine Powder, put it to the Purple
Eiquor, and you will have as beautiful a Crimfon:
Strain it through a fine Cloth, ufe it as foon 2s
poftible; for though this is a Colour, which if foon
sifed looks extremely well, yet by long flanding is
subject to decay.
PU.R PL E S.

Care is required in the ufing this Colour; for, as we
before hinted, its running to free may be a Mleans of

Completion of his Defires.
Mr. Royle has given us the following Directions
for making a very fine Coloer of the blue Leaves of

and Juice in pure Water, for a Fortnight, washing

Way of bringing the Flowers to Perfectim.

A Sea or Artificial Green is made, by mixing

DIRECTIONS for using the Colours.
wills; and
Your Pencils muft be fatt in their O
sharp pointed (after you have drawn them thro' your
Mouth) not apt to part in the Middle.
Before you begin, have all your Colours ready,
and a Pallet for the Conveniency of mixing them,
a Paper to lay your Hand, as well as try your
Colours upon, alfo a large Bruth called a Fitch to
wipe off the Duft from them.
Being prepared according to the foregoing Mc-
thod, proceed in your Painting, which if a Land-
Icape, lay on firft dead Colours all over your Piece,
leaving no Part uncovered: And in this Part of the
45
ferformance there needs no great Pains, but a mat-
terly Freedom is rather required; and the Work,
though


 25
though feemingly rough upon a clofe Inspection,
vill have a good Effect; when placed at a Diftance,
Ler not the Roughness of the Work difcourage you,
for it is eafily fofsened by Degrees, with the other
Shadows, obferving only to fweeten, mellow, and
heighten them as the Light falls.
In some Places lay on ftrong and mafterly Fouches,
and in thofe Places bring up your Work to an equal
Roundnets and Strength; tempering and sweetening
your Coloars with a sharper Pencil than the firft, shat
no Lumps or harth Edges be left, but that all your
Shadows may lie differted, foft, and Limooth, gliding
gently into one another.
You are not to finith any one Part firft, but
work up every Part gradually alike, till you fee no-
thing wanting to complete your Piece.

your Colours deeper as
Lake and White, making
they go upwards from the Horizon, except in tem-
peftuous Skies. The Tops of diftant Rhountains
muft be worked to faint, that they may feem to lofe
Themfelves in the Air.
Bring your Colours forward, as your Diftance de-
creafes; painting your firft Ground next the Hori-
2on downwards, of bluith Sea-Green, and as you
advance forwards, of a darker Green, till you come
so the Fore-Ground itfelf, which as it is the darkeff

Manner, as to give the appearance of Shrubbery,

been efteemed by the Generality of Mankind an
fmatement attended with many Difficulties; yet
mothing can afford a more folendid and marnificent
Reprefentation of Nature, than a Painting well exe-
eated in this Manner; there being no Outlines of
Shadino reouired, thofe in the Frint anfwering that
EIId.
Mezzotinto Prints are generally ufed for this Pur-
mofe, the Shades and Lines not being to harfh and
abrunt. as thofe of Enoraving as they are blended
into each other and have the Abpearance of 2
Dsawino in Indian Ink.

with a Hog's Hair Bruth as thin and fmooth as pot-
sible; lay the Print flat in Water, and let it remain
on the Surface till is. finks; take it carefully our
with its Face downwards, and dab it between fome
Papers till no Water appears, yet to as the Print re-
mains damp.
Afterwards lay the damp Printon its Backupon a
Hat Table; hold the Glats over is without touching
the Turpentine, till it is exactly even with the
Print, then letting the Glats fall gently on it, care-
fully prets it down with your Fingers in different
Parts, to that the Turpentine may stick to the
Print; then taking it up, hold the Glats towards you,
presting the Print from the Centre towards the
Edges till no Bliffers remain.
Next wet the Back of your Print with 2 Sponge,
till the Paper will rub off with your Fingers, rub
it gently, and the white Paper wiil come off, leaving
2 very plain Impreffion on the Glafs; when dry, wer
it all over with a Camel's Hair Pencil dipt in Tur-
pentine Oil, and it will be perfectly tranfparent, and
fit for Painting.

If the Colours are too thick, make them thinner

Hlave a Pencil for each Colour; never put a Bruth
