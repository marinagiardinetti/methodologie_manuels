INTRODUCTION.
WANY learned and ingenious men have
employed the acumen of their talents in
explaining the theory of light and colours,
which form a very important part of the foi-
ence of painting. To excel in colouring, the
artiff muft be thoroughly well grounded
in the principles of that branch of optics
which treats of the nature of light. He will
there find that wbite, by which light may
be otherwife termed, is not, philofophically
peaking, a fimple and primitive colour,
but is compounded of feveral colours, of
which the number and proportion are well

Known. By means of a glats prifm, the
component tays of light may be separated
into feven diffint parcels exhibiting red,
orange, yellow; green, blue, indigo, violet;
and although thefe rays are immutable in
themfelves, yet they are continually fepa-
fating from each other in their pallage
through the various objects they may
meet. Thus, for inftance, grass reflects
the green rays of light, while port roine
reflects the red rays; and fubltances that
participate of other colours, have this pe-
culiar property accounted for on fimilar
reafoning. By this frequent feparation
of different rays is nature fo beautifully
diverfified (a).

-together with the opinions of Mr. Huffey Delaval,
which, though now firongly combated, are highly
ingenious.—To a mind yet further anxious for
philofophic inveltigarion, an original work of real
excellence may be confulted, which, though it oppo-
fes the opinions of Newton and Delaval, is deferving
of the moft ferious inveftigation, viz. of Experimental

if the ftudent will keep pariently viewing the gra-
dual declention of the fun. When the glow of the

let the reader view a glowing fire through the me-

cool. Perhaps this may be further exemplified by
contraft: let the reader view a well-painted fire, and
he will be led to feel himfelf warm. Some
of Claude's pictures have this slightly greenish bue of

could not diffinctly fee their colours: he could fee
cherries on a free, but could not fay whether they
were white or black. In general, all light colours
he termed white, and all darx colours black. He
was fo anxious to know the nature of light and co-
lours, that he attended a courfe of lectures in natu-
fal philofophy.—Two of his brothers were in like
circumftances; but two other brothers and fifters,

BUr, befides the superiorityacquired by
the Hudy of optics in what has been juft
enumerated, the fame principles will fully
explain many other things practifed by
Painters; for, were their works not judged
of on the bafis of philofophy, a confiderable
thare of their merit muft be attributed to
ences of light and fhade, but believed, from the re=
marks of others, that they were various and diffinet.
(e) Of late years the art of colouring has been
affiduoully cultivated in the Britith fchool, owing
in a great meafure to the emulation excited by that
great mafter, Sir Jofhns Reynolds. Could the ex-
periments in which he failed, and thofe in which
he fucceeded, be collected and divulged, a confider.
able advantage muft of confequence enfue; for good

By thefe means the approaches to a

the appropriation of thofe principles as
practifed by the beft colourifts; after
which, the practical application of the ma-

will confequently occupy the attention.
Ir has been a generally received opi-
nion, that the ancient painters had no
more

more than four colours, out of which all
their other tints were formed. This po-
fition has been very ably combated by
the ingenious Mr. Thomas Cooper, who
has written an effay on this exprets fub-
jelt in the papers of the Manchefter Soci=
ety (6). He conceives this notion to
have arifen from too hafty a perufal, or a
mifapprehention, of thofe paltages of an-
cient authors which are quoted in fup-
port of it. Cicero, Pliny, Exc. wrote of
perfons who were ancients in their days,
not concerning the cuftoms of their con-
temporaries, which latter are the per-
117
fons termed ancients by us. Wherever
mention is made of the cuftoms of their
own times, many proofs are given of the
application of more colours than for-

lead went under the names of minium se-

they certainly had the cochineal infect,

 Of the biue paints, they had prepa-

which they poffeffed, and which I am in-

former. Indigo they had and bice or imall,
for they made blue glafs, but whether

from fome ore of cobalt or of wohtraim

They had not Pruffian-blue, verditer, or
litmus, which we have. We do not ufe
the blue precipitate of the dyers vats, nor
mountain blue, which they certainly em-
ployed.
 Or green colours, they had verdigrife,
terra verte, and malacbite or mountain
green the latter is not in ufe among us.
Sap-green and Scheeles green appear to
have been unknown to them. Like us,
they produced as many tints as they

that from gold by means of tin, though
very good when well prepared, is too dear,
and is unneceffary. Their purple was a
tinged earth.
& THEIR orange, or Jandarach (red
orfiment), we alfo poffels. Hence there
does not appear to have been any great
want of pigments, or any very material
difference between the colours they ufed
and fuch as we generally employ.—Per-
haps the full effect of colouring may be
obteined without the ufe of the exceeding
brilliant pigments, by depending more on
the proportion and opposition of tints.
COLOURINC was carried to a great de-
gree


INTRODUCTION. 21
gree of excellence formerly, as may be
clearly afcertained by the writings of va-
rious authors, who ftate that the Roman
artifis particularly trufted to it; but it is
highly probable that the moderns have
exceeded them in this particular branch of
painting. The number of the modern
colours, and their preparations have en-
abled them to excel their predeceffors in
the variety of their tints, independent of
the chrarofcuro, which would alone go a
great way towards the fame excellence.
All this, and a great deal more that might

22 INTRODUCTION.
Rembrandt, Rubens and Vandyke, are
very partially known to us, and are now
rather difianly imitated than practically
identified.
REMERANDT, who was a mafter of
colouring in the higheft degree, died in
1668. Loult, who ranked next to him,
died in England about eight years after.
Lely diel in 1630. Reily, a difciple of
Louft, furvived them both, and was the
beft eclourt of his day. Then came
Richardion, who died in 1745, and,
though taught by Reily, was much in-
ferior to lum in merit. Thus we fee in
how thort a ame the art of colouring de-
clined, which was in high perfection in
the time of Rembrandt.
WHENEVER a diicovery is made where-

it becomes the duty of every one to pro-
mulge and extend it. For want of an
open and philofophic difpofition in mat-
ters of this fort, men of great abilities
have dwindled into tradefmen, and have
carried to their graves a ffore of infor-
mation which, during life, was a lucra-
tive monopoly.
By fimilar means, we are deprived of
the knowledge of many valuable arts
practifed by the ancients, who from mo-
tives of jealouty or avarice excluded others
from a participation of their skill. The
Jultinian code, for inftance, contains a
striet prohibition of the ufe of the Tyrian
purple dye, except within the walls of
the palace; and although experience con-
vinced the Eaftern Emperors of the folly
and impolicy of fuch interdicts, not all

the art became extinet alfo; which thews the ne-

FRo a clofe inspection of the beft

it appears that the drugs and the colour-

prepared and more fcrupuloully felected

of colours are not preparers of them; and,
being ignorant of their compofition, re-

materials are either not genuine, or are
vilely fophifticated; and when ground,
and fied up in bladders, are mixed with
taw and impure oils. It would be well
if the Royal Academy of Painting would
elect cenfors to enforce propriety in this
refpect, after the cuftom of the College of
Phyficians or at lealt appoint a few honeft
and well-informed colourmen; or, what is
perhaps better, have a laboratory of their
own, and apply the profits to the fup-
port of decayed merit, and the patronage
of rifing genius.
AFTER all, to recapitulate the more
valuable confiderations of the truly ani-
mated Rudent, let him never reft fatisfied

and aloof from general explanation. On
of the whole, —to recur to Reynolds (o),
& there is but one prefiding principle
66
which regulates and gives ttability to
of every art. The works, whether of
co poets, painters, moralifts, or hiftorians,

which are the following: Take of French

by lkering through paper and a linen

red is a natural ochrous earth brought
from the ifland of Ormus, in the Perlian

that the calces of iron may be made to

quantities to the purpofes of dyeing.
IVoRY BLACK. If this colour were
really prepared from the raspings of ivory.
which in truth it ought to be, it is a very
beautiful jet black; but unhappily. it. is
prepared only from bones, which by no

It may be obtained from common orpi-
ment by fublimation.
LAKE, to called from gum-lacca, from
which it was at firft prepared, is a very
beautiful ringe of red, purple, or yellow
colouring fubltances precipitated on the
earth of alum. The red and purple lakes
are prepared from cochineal, madder, and
Kermes berries; the yellow fort, from the
curcuma orturneric-root. Sonice are the
miniature-painters in water-colours in the
procuration of lake, that great prices are
given for it. The great complaints made
againtt the red lake are, that it is too pur-

ftances collected from lamps. At prefent,
to great is the confumption, a process of a
much greater extent is effected. For in=

Foffils, p. 56, is highly miftaken as to the
nature of this material. He fays that it is.
a bolar earth, impregnated with a ferrugi-
nous calx, very beautiful, of a bright and
elegant yellow between a gold and faffron
colour, and of a very loofe, porous, spongy
and thattery texture. It is found, as he
lays, in fome parts of Italy, fometimes on
the furface of the earth, at other times very
deep.— The truth is now, however, difco-
vered by Ml. Fougerous, who has demon-
ftrated that it is made by art. The perfon
who prepares it at Naples, fcrupuloully con-
ceals every circumftance that might lead to
a difcovery of its nature and preparation.
It contains, by chemical analyfis, an abfor-
bent earth, a vegetable acid united with
lead, an aluminous and ammoniacal. fall,
and a calx of antimony. ccordingly, on
mixing together intimately twelve ounces

OCHRE. The name of a large genris
of earths, ufed principally by the painters.
The moft common kinds are the red and
yellow though there are brown, blue and

eleven species; of the red, the same num-
ber; of the brown, two; of the blue and
green, one species each. Ochre is a fer-

uginous earth, or ofe of iron: the specis
mens of fuch as are dark may be bright:
ened by calcination. They appear to be
produced by the decompolition of martial
pyrites, which confift of fulphur and iron.
By the action of air and water the fulphur
becomes acidified, and forms vitriol, and
the iron is depofited on calcareous earths
which feire the acid. Iron is frequently
extracted from this ore.

propagated to a great extent. M. Monet
gives the following method of preparing
yerdigrife.


64
TE
verdigrife :— Vine-Htalks well dried in the
fun are fteeped during eight days in frong
wine, and again dried. After this they
are put into earthen pots; and wine is
poured upon them; the pots being clofely
covered. When the fermentation, which
in fummer takes place in eight days, and
in winter fomewhat later, has advanced, the
Htalks are to be taken out of the pots.
They are then to be drained for a while,
and alternaie layers of Htalks and plates of
Swedith copper are to be arranged in
earthen pots clofely covered. Afterthree
or four days the plates will be corroded;
when they are to be taken out, and left
in a cellar, and are occationally to be
wetted with water, or weak vinegar. This
operation of wetting and drying being
repeated three times, the rult may be
Icraped off for fale. Other methods are
practifed elfewhere, by ordinary vinegar:

but it has been obferved that, if the
acid be not vinous, the verdigrife will not
have that uncluofity to defirable, and even
neceffary, in painting. Great quantities
are now made at Grenoble, fince the
vulgar prejudice in favour of the cellars
of Montpellier has been done away.

WHITE EARTH. See Earth, White.
WHITE LEAD. The preparation of
this pigment has become a diftinct trade,
and is practited in many parts of this
Kingdom. The author of the Chemical
Dictionary, M. Macquer, gives the fol-
lowing description of the procels: Leaden
plates rolled fpirally, fo that the space of
an inch shall be left between each circum
volution, muft be placed vertically in
earthen pots of a proper fize, containing
tome good vinegar. Thefe leaden rolls
ought to be fupported in the pots, that
they do not touch the vinegar, but that
the vapour of this acid may circulate free-
ly betwixt the circumvolutions. Thefe pots
are to be covered, and placed in a bed of
F 2
dung,


63
WII
dung, or in a fand-bath, by which a
gentle heat may be applied. The acid of
vinegar, being thus reduced into vapours,
catily attaches itfelf to the furface of thefe
plates, penetrates them, and is impreg-
lated with this metal, which it reduces to
a beautiful white powder, called cernss.
When this powder is ground, and fitted
for painting, it is termed white lead.—
Flake-white and Nottingham-white are
alfo preparations of lead, and are nearly
the felf fame thing. Through the com-
munication of a philofophical gentleman
of veracity the writer of this is enabled
to hate—that the principal difference be-
tween the procets of making obite lead
and Nottingsam-white confitts in the ufe
of alegar inttead of vinegar From a
very fevere trial he made of both the
white colours, the preference is decidedly
in favour of Nottingham-white— he
painted


WII

painted the back-board of a picture frame,
one half with common obite lead, the
other half with Nottingbam-white. The
picture in its frame was hung up as ufual,
and was not difturbed for feveral months;
at the end of which time the picture was
removed, and the fide painted with Notting-
ham-wbite wasnearly as whiteas ever, while
the other half was changed to a deep yel-
low.—If a conjecture may be offered on
the superior efficacy of alegar over vinegar
in the preparation of a white colour from
lead, it is—that alegar contains more of a
vinows acid than common vinegar. for,
independent of the greater quantity of
faccharine matter which enters into 1ts
compolition, it poffeffes the virtue and
spirit of the bop, a peculiarity unknown
to the common vinegar. That a vinous
acid is fuperior to any other is well
Known, as the verdigrife made at Mont-

highly valuable to the painter in minid-

water being now poured on, and the glats

If a small quantity of acid of vitriol be
now added, it throws down a beautiful
ebite precipitate; and the acid of ire
being left at liberty to act upon the re-
mainder of the litharge, begins anew to
diffolve it with effervefcence. When it is
again faturated, which will be Known by
the difcontinuance of the bubbles, more
acid of vitriol is to be dropped in, and a
white precipitate is again thrown down.
If any of the litharge remains undiffolved,
the nitrous acid being fet at liberty a fe-
cond time, attacks it as at firft; and by
continuing to add acid of vitriol, the
whole of the litharge may be converted

Ir has been firongly recommended to
Paper-ftarners, and others who ufe water-
colours in large quantities, to prepare their
lakes, and the colours now prepared of
chalk, on the bafis of the above precipi-
tate of lead.—For inftance. if the colour
required be a very fine one, suppofe from
cochineal, the colouring matter is to be
firtt extracted by fpirst of wins, without
heat. When the spirit is fufficiently un-
pregnated, it is to be poured by little and
little upon the cals. the fpirst foon evapo-
fates, and leaves the calx coloured with
the cochineal. More of the tincture is
then to be poured on, rubbing the mix=

ragement, many beautiful colours, not in-
ferior to the beft carmine, may be pres
pared.—When only a fnall quantity of
colour, for the more exquitite touches of
the miniature painter, is required, we
would recommend the process to be con-
ducted on the bafis of robite precipitate,
or calx of tin, purfuing the same method
of rubbing in the colouring tincture as
when white precipitate of lead is uted.
If, inftead of cochineal, Brazil-wood, tur-
meric, logwood, Exc. be fubftituted, dif-
ferent kinds of red, yellow, and purple
may be produced.—Aqueous decoctions,.
in lien of fpiriruous extracts, may be ufed
for coarfer work; but the process is more
tedious, from the length of time required
to evaporate the water. Art may, how-
ever, be employed here to affift the eva-

THE following rules are derived from

that the day will come when modern ge-
nins shall ecliple the productions of former

ON a comparifon with Mr. Bardwell's

104 PRACTICAL RULES FOR

OF BACK-GROUNDS.
VAN DYCK made out the keeping in
his back-grounds more from the different
oppofition and harmony of the colours,
than from his knowledge of the claro
obfcuro. There is not in his pictures
that intelligence of light and shade, which
1s to Hriking and beautiful in Rembrandts.
Van Dyck's general method was to be
very Hill and mellow and to break the
colours of the ground with thofe of the
drapery. This will certainly produce
harmony, the principles of which method
belong only to the art of colouring: but
it is the knowledge of light and shade
which gives that furpriting force and
ftrength, which, at firft fight, we find in
Rembrandts works. There is a picture of
a lady,


PAINTING IN OIL COLOURS. TOg
a lady, where he has made the ground
juft light enough to thew her complexion
and hair, which is a dark brown, in the
greatelt perfection. the ground is a wall,
which, near to the face, is lighter than
the shadows of the fleth, and the light
diminithes fo artfully in the gradations,
that though the part round the head is
much darker, yet it appears to be of the
same colour with that near the fieth.
This method of relieving the head from
the ground is better than Van Dyck's
method, where he has made the ground
almoft of the fame colour with the hair;
and though his way of breaking the
colours of the ground with thofe of the
draperies is admirable, yet there appears
t00 near a famenels, as in tome of his pic-
tures; where he has carried this principle
to near that it is almoft imperceptible.
In Rembrandt's pictures at Farmouth, the
lights


106 PRACTICAL RULES FOR
lights and shades are as vifible as thofe in
his prints, and are remarkably broad,
clear, and Hill; the fhadows are very
warm and thin, and look as if they were
painted all at once, with a plenty of co-
lour, which appears tranfparent: which
trauparency was done by glazing the
dead colouring.
THE principal colours that are necet
fary for painting of back-grounds in per-
traiture, as walls, buildings, or the like,
are white, black, Indian red, light and
brown ochre, Pruffian-blue, and burnt
umbre, from which the eight principal
tints are made, as follows:
1. Pearl is made of black, white, and
a little Indian red.
2. Lead, of black and white, mist to
a dark lead-colour.
3. Fellow,

4. Olive, of light ochre, Pruffian-blue,

7. Stone, of white, umbre, black, and

8. Dark-sbade, of black and Indian

lead; and the Murrey is a very good

the olive is too frong.. The umbre,

All the colours should be laid with drying
oil only, becaute they mix and fet the
better with the foftener.
WHERE the marks of the trowel are fo
frong in the priming of the cloth, that
one body of colours will not be fuffi-
cient to conceal it, we should lay a colour
to prevent it; which should be dry, be-
fore we begin with thofe parts that we
expect to finith at one painting.
THE method of painting back-grounds
is divided into two parts.
THE firft part is the work of the
firft lay: the second is to follow on that,
with the finithing tints.

give it more of the required hue, but
very near in regard to tone and ftrength;
leaving them like mezzotinto.
THE dark and warm fhadows should
be laid before the colours that join them:
this we should do with the dark-fhade

thofe be accompanied with fine tender cold

Jours only. viz. the lights, middle tint,

degree between the high lights and the
thade-tint. The Thade-rint should be
dark enough for the general hue of all
the thadows, for which reafon it is called
the thade-tint.
WE should obferve, that the lights
should rather incline to a warmith hue,
and the middle tint should be made of
friendly working colours, fuch as will
always mix of a clean, tender, coldifh
hue. The shade-tint should be made of
the same colours as the middle tint, only
with lets light; therefore this tint will
alfo mix of a tender clean colour. It is
with thefe three colours we should make
out the whole, like mezzotinto and we
should underttand, that all the beauty
and character of the folds, the shape, atti-

all to be confidered and made with thefe
three colours only; which should be done
to our fatisfaction before we add any of
the reffects or finishing tints.
THE reffects of drapery and fatins are
generally productions of their own, and
are always lighter than the fhadows on
which they are found; and being pro-
duced by light, will confequently have a
light, warm colour, mixed with the local
colour that receives them. Here it will
be neceffary to obferve the general me=
thod and secret in managing the colours
of the firlt lay, and thofe of the reffects
and finithing tints.
IN the firft lay, the high. lights should
be laid with plenty of fliff colour, and
then fhaped and foftened into character
with the middle tint, very correctly.
Where


PAINTINNG IN OIL COLOURS. 125
Where the gradations of the lights are
flow, as in the large parts, it will be pro-
per to lay the middle tint firft at their
extremities, with a tool that will drive the
colour, and leave it paringly; becaufe the
lights will mix and he the better upon it:
ext, make out all the parts of the fhadows
with the fhade-tint drove bare. after this
comes the middle tint, which fills up, and
ferves as the fecond lights and gradations,
and should be managed together very
nicely, to character, without touching any
of the high lights which finith the firft
la7.
THE reffects and finithing tints are in
general the antipathies of the firft lay:
they will, without great care, porfon and
dirty the colours on which they are laid;
and therefore should be laid with a deli
cate light touch, without foftening. If it

dows; on which we should lay the
white with one light touch; and be fure
not to cover all the part that was made

the character, and look like a spot, for
want of the foftening edge or border,

NENT come the reffects and finithing
tints.
BROwN ochre, mixed with the colour
of the lights, is the moft ufeful colour in
general for all reffects in draperies that are
produced from their own colours. All
accidental reffexes are made with the co-
lour of the parts from which they are pro-
duced, and the local colours that receive
them. There are but two reflecting tints
franted for draperies in general; 2. c. to
any one particular colour: one should be
lighter than the middle tint, the other
darker. Thefe colours may be a little
changed on the palette with the firft and
middletints, as occafion requires, or lightly
broken


PAINTING IN OHL COLOURS. 19r
broken on the part that receives them: but
this laft method is not to fafe as the other.
The rint fufficient for blending the dark
Shadows to the mellow tender hue, is made
with the fhade-tint and a little brown
ochre; which should be laid on very par-
ingly, with foft light touches, for fear of
making them dull and heavy. If it should
be over-done, we may recover it with the
colour it was laid upon.
WE often fee a little bhie ufed in the
firft unt of white fatin. Van Haecken,
who was the beft drapery-painter we ever
had in England, did fo; and fometimes;
inftead of the blue, he ufed bhie-black, till
he found it to be a pernicious colour, and
was therefore obliged to ufe blue; be-
caufe his middle tint, which was made only
of black and whice, was fo very cold, that
no other colour but blye would make a

colder tint: yet he managed thefe cold
colours, in all the lights and middle tints;
to agreeably, and fo light and eafy was his
touch, that we cannot help admiring, and
may learn fomething from him. Though,
he was not to lucky in his fhadows, which
were generally of a heavy dirty hue. this
was owing to the colours he ufed, and the
method of uling them; which will always
have fuch an effect, when a warm or dirty
colour is mixed with a clean light one; for,
being mixed together, they will form a
dirty colour, that muft confequently appear
to in the work. Bur if his lead or thade-
fint had been mised with Indian red in-
stead of the cchre, and then followed with
a few light blending touches of the ochre-
tint, it would have left them clean and
mellow. It is the want of the red hue
which makes the white fatins appear fo
often like pewter.

will appear, and fland; for the lights of
blue should be managed with as much
care as thote of white fatin. Next is, to
follow with the reft of the middle tint,
and then make out all the fhadows. The
more we drive the fhade-tint, the better
it will receive the reffects and finithing
fints. The fhadows should be ftrength-
ened and blended with ivory-black and
tome of their own colour, which will
mix with them into a tender, mellow
hue.
THE reflects are made as thofe of white
fatin; that 1s, with ochre and fome of the
lights; which should be perfectly done,

as we intend it, at one painting. The
fhadows, when dry, may be a little im-
proved, if there is occafion to alfer them,

The Pruffian-blue proper to be ufed, is
that which looks of the moft beautiful
ature before it is ground; and the fooner
it is ufed after it is ground, the better it
will work and appear.
VELVET may be painted at once. The
method is, to make out the firft lay with
the middle tint and shade tint on which
we should lay the high lights with light
touches, and finith the fhadows as we did
thofe of the fatin, but the nearelt imita-
tion of velvet we can make, is done by

glazing; which is prepared on a ground
or dead -colouring of fuch colours as will,
when dry, bear out and fupport the glar-
ing colour in iis higheft perfection. The
nature of the glazing colour is to be of a
fine tranfparent quality, and ufed fimply
with oil only; to that whatever ground

it is laid on, the whole may appear di-

Rincery t ough 1t. The beft ground for
blue is made with white and 1vory-black:
the white is for the high lights, which,
with the middle tint and fhade-tint,
makes out the firtt lay, like merzotinto.
Remember to make the middle tint lighter
in proportion to the glaring, becaufe that
will make it the darker. It is often ne-
ceffary to cover all but the high lights
with a thin glazing; not with plenty of
5
vil in the colour, but laid with lets quan-
tity than if ii was to be done once only.
If any of it touch the lights, we should
wipe it off with a clean rag. The very

high lights should be improved, and made
of a fine white, and left to dry. The

on the latt glazing we should frengthen
and finith the fhadows.
THE greateft fault in the colouring of
draperies is, the painting the shadows with
Hrong glaring colours, which defiroy the
beauty of the lights. This is not only
the reverfe of art, but of nature, whofe
beauty always diminithes in proportion
with the lights; for this reafon we should
take care to blend and foften the fhadows
with fuch friendly colours as will agree
with their local character and obicurity.
Here we may obferve, that glazing the
middle tint, which is made of black and
white, will not produce a colour to blue,
as if it had been prepared with Pruffian-
blue and white; yet this colour will pre-
serve the beauty of the lights in the
higheft perfection, by reafon of its tender
obicure hue, when the blueness of the
other


13S PRACTICAL RULES FOR

other would only diminith them. This
method of glazing the blue is the general
rule for all glazing.
WHEN we are glazing blue, the lights
may be glazed with ultramarine, though
all the other parts are done with Prulfian

blue. This method faves a great quan-
tity of that valuable colour, and anfivers
our purpofe as well as if it had all been
done with ultramarine.
THOwGH this general method of paint-
ing latins, is to make the firtt lay of co-
lours with three degrees of tints; yet we
should underfland, in uling them, that
they produce two more: for the mixing
of two diffcrent colours together on the
cloch, will make another of a middle tint

shade-tint; the firft anfwers to the firft
sint in white fatin; and the laft will con-
sequently be a fort of gradating, or half-
Shade.
If the lights and middle tint mix to a
beautiful, clean colour, of a middle hue
between both, there will be no occafion
for a colour to go between them, as in
the blue fatin; but if in mixing, they
produce a tint inclining to a dirty warm
hue, then there muft be another found
of a fympathizing nature, which should
he laid between them, in order to preferve
the beauty of the lights, as the firft tint
in the white fatin; for if it was not fo,
the red, in the middle tint, would certain-
ly dirty and fpoil the whire.

with the addition of a little black in the

fearlet and crimfon is, that the high lights
of crimfon are whiter, and the middle
tint is made darker. Their reflects are
made with lightred and vermilion. The
high lights should be laid and managed
in the fame manner as thofe of the blue;
for fear of dirtying them; and fometimes
they require to be touched over the fe-
cond time, before we glaze them. The

be managed to character; but the high

THERE are two different methods of
painting a pink colour: one is by glaz-

changed with a little of the pearl tint
made with the dark fhade and white;
which should be laid and managed as the
firft fint in white fatin. The middle tint
1s a mixture of the light and brown ochre;
foftened with the pearl tint. The shade-
tint is made with brown pink and brown
ochre. Thefe belong to the firft lay.
THE reffects are light ochre; and fome-
times, in the warmelt parts, mixed with a
little lightred: the fhadows are ftrength-
ened with brown pink and burnt umbre.
THESE colours, well managed, will

but if we leave out the King's yellow,
which is in the high lights only, then it
will be one of Lely's favourite yellows.
GREEN.
THE proper ground for green is a
light-yellow green; which is made of
light ochre, a little white, and Pruffian-
blue, for the lights; and the ochre, brown
pink, and Pruffian-blue, for the shadows.
THE fineff green we have, for drapery,
15 made of King's yellew Pruffian-blue,

King's yellow and a very little Pruffian-

be managed in the fame manner as thofe

kept entirely from the lights, becaufe the
brown pink that is in 1t, will, in mixing,
dirty them, as the black does thofe of the
blues. Remember to allow for their dry-
ing a little darker; and that the King's
yellow should be ground with good dry-
ing oil. for the longer it is drying, the
more it will change and grow darker;

CHANGEABLE.


PAINTINGNOIL, COLOURS. 147
CHANCEABLE.
CHANGEABLE colours are made
with four principal tints, viz. the high
lights, middle tint, shade tint, and reflect-
ing tint.
THE greatelf art lies in finding the
exact colour of the middle tint; becaute
it has more of the general hue of the filk
than any of the others. The shade-tint is
of the fame hue with the middle tint,
though it is dark enough for the fhadows.
The high lights, though often very dif-
ferent from the middle tint, should be of
a clean, friendly-working colour, that will,
in mixing with It, produce a tint of a
clean fympathizing hue.
THE method of painting filks is to
make out the folds with the fhade tint,
and

and then fill them up in the lights with
the middle tint. This is the firft lay,
which should be done to our fatisfaction
before we add any other colours; and
the Hiffer the middle tint is uted, the
better the high lights may be laid upon
1t. The reffecdingunt falls generally upon
the gradating half-fhades, and should be
laid with tender touches, (paringly, for
fear of fpoiling the firft lay.
This method of painting antwers to
all coloured filks, as well as changeable,
with this difference only, that the plain
colours require not fo much art in match-
ing the tints, as the changeable do. The
laft part of the work is the finithing, and
Rrengthening the fhadows with an obfcure
int, a little inclining to a mellowith hue;
tuch as will not carch the eye, and inter-
rupt the beauty of the lights.
BLACK.


PAINTINGINOIL COLOURS. T49
BLACK.
THE beft ground for black is light-
red for the lights; and Indian red and a
little black for the shadows.
THE finithing colours are, for the lights,
black, white, and a little lake. The mid-
dle tint has lets white, and more lake and
black. The fhade-tint is made of an equal
quantity of lake and brown pink, with a
very little black.
THE method of painting black is very
different from that of other colours; for
as the principal thing in them, is to leave
their lights clean and brilliant, fo in black,
it is to keep the fhadows clear and tranf-
parent. Therefore we should begin with
the shade-tint, and glaze over all the sha-

Lhadows with black, and a little of the
Thade-tinr, very corredly. After that fill
up the whole breadth of lights with the
middle tint only. All which should be
done exactly to the character of the fatin,
Exc. and then finish with the high lights.
HERE we may obferve, the ground,
being red, will bear out and fupport the
reds, which are ufed in the finithing co-
lours. the lake in the lights takes off the
cold hue, and gives it a more beautiful
colour. If the fhade-tint was of any other
colour than a tranfparent warm hue, the
Ihadows would confequently be black and

an allowance in uling it. There will be
a few reflects in fatin, which should be
added as thofe of other colours; but they

a little of the shade-tint.
ThovO the grounds which are here
mentioned for the draperies, are abfolutely

IN the dead-colouring we should take

BEFORE proceeding any farther, it will
be proper to fay fomething of the moft
ufeful glazing colours.
LAKE, Terra-Verte, Pruffian-Blue and
Brown Pink, are the four principal. The
more we manage them like Indian ink,
and the more diffint we leave them, the
better their tranfparent beauty will fland
and appear, provided we do it with good
drying oil. After thefe four glazing co-
lours, burnt umbre is a very good glaring,
warm brown, and of great ufe in the
broken grounds and neareft parts; but
the moft agreeable colour for the darkeft
Thadows, is the dark-fhade improved with
lake. It is a fine warm hade, when it is
drove with drying oil: no colour in the
world is to fweet and fympathiting; it
Mixes harmonioutly with all the lights,
as well as the thadows, and is a charming

colour in the trunks and bodies of trees;
and in all Kinds of buildings.
WE should make out all the ground of
the objects with fuch glazing fhadow-
colours, as feem neareft to the natural hue
of the object, in that fituation. But as the
principal glazing colours themfelves are
often too firong and glaring, they should
therefore be a little changed, and foftened
with fuch colours as are of a near re-
temblance to themfelves and the objects.
Thus, if it is in the diftances; the terra-
verte and azure, which are their principal
glazing: colours, may be improved and
made lighter with fome of the fky tints;
and as the diftances come nearer, with
the purple. fis we get more into the
middle group; the terra-verte and Pruffian-
blue may be changed with some of the
green tints, fuch as are made without

white;

168 PRACTICAL RULES FOR
white; for white is the deftruction of all
glazing colours. As we approach the firft
group, there is lets occafion for changing
them; but the fore-ground, and its ob-
jelts, require all the Arength and force of
glazing which the colours are capable of
producing.
AFTER this glazing ground, we should

follow with firengthening the fame in the
thadows and darkeft places, in fuch man-
ner as will feem eaty to finith; which is
the firft lay of the second painting.
The colours that come next for finish-
ing, are in the degree of middle tints.
Thefe should be carefully laid over the
greateff breadth of lights, in fuch manner
as not to fpoil and cover too much of the
glazing. Do it with a good body of the
colour, as fliff as the pencil can agreeably
manage

manage to character. Remember, the
colours of the middle tint should be of a
clean, beautiful hue. According to thefe
methods, I think it will be eaty to finith
all the second painting as we work down,
from the fky, through the middle group.
As we come to the firft group, where all the
objects should appear perfectly finithed, we
should finith their under or moft diftant
parts, before we paint any of the other
which appear nearer. Oblefye this me-
thod down to the laft and neareft objects
of the picture; and where it fo happens
that painting one tree over another does
not pleafe, forbear the second, until the
firft is dry. Thin, near trees, of different
colours, will do better if we let the under
Parts dry before we add the finithing
colours.


THE


1
170 PRACTICAL RULES FOR
THE THIRD AND LAST
PAINTING.
IF oiling is neceffary, lay the leaft quan-
tity that can be; which should be done
with a Rump-tool, or pencil, proportioned
to the place that is to be oiled, to that we
may oil no more than is wanted: then
wipe the whole place that is oiled, with
a piece of filk handkerchief. By this me-
thod we leave no more oil than is proper
for our purpofe.

WHEN we are going to finith any ob-
jects, we should remember to ule a great
variety of tints, very near of the same co-
lour; but moft of all, when we are finith-
ing trees. This gives a richness to the
colouring, and produces harmony. The
greens


PAINTINGINOIL COLOURS. 17r
Greens will fade, and grow darker there-
fore it is highly neceffary to improve and
force them, by exaggerating the lights,
and making an allowance in uling them
to much the lighter. For the fame reafon,
we should take great care that we do not
overcharge and fpoil the beauty of the
glazing; for if we do, it will be dull
and heavy, and will confequently grow
darker,
THE method for painting near trees is
to make the firft lay very near to nature,
though not quite fo dark, but more in the
degree of a middle tint, and follow it
with frengthening the fhadows, and im-
proving the middle tints; and laft of all,
lay the high lights and finithing colours.
But all this cannot be done as it should
be at one painting: therefore, the beft
way is to do no more than the firtt lay
with
1


172 PRACTICAL RULES FOR
with the faint fhadows, and leave it to
dry.
THEN begin with improving the mid-
dle tints and fhadows, and let them dry.
THE third and laft work is adding all
the lights and finithing colours, in the
beft manner we are able. This method of
leaving the firtt and second part to dry fe-
parately, not only makes the whole much
ealier, and more agreeable, but leaves the
colours in the greateft perfection; becaufe
moft of the work may be done with fcum-
bling and glazing, and fome parts without
oiling. The lights alfo may be laid with
a better body of colour, which will not be
mixed and fpoiled with the wet ground.
What I have faid of trees, anfwers the
tame to all Kinds of thrubs and buthes.
THE


PAINTING IN OHL, COLOURS. 173
THE figures in a landlcape are the laft
work of the picture; thofe in the fore-
ground should be done firft, and thofe in
the diftances next : for, after the figures in
the firft and fartheft group are painted, it
will be much eafier to find the proportions
of thofe in the middle parts of the picture.
And we should obferve, that the fhadows
of the figures should be of the same hue
or colour with thofe of the group, or
place, they are in.

WHITE PIGMENTS.
TAKEN FROM A. MEMOIR OF M. DE
MORVEAU, READ IN THE ACADEPIY
OF DIjON.


WHITE Is the moft important of all
colours in painting. It affords to the
painter the materials of light, which he
diftributes in fuch a manner as to bring

his objects together, to give them relict,

and that magic which is the glory of his
art. Forthefe reafons, my attention will

be confined to this colour.


THE firft white which was difcovered,
and





ON WHITE PIGMENTS. 219
and indeed the principal one yet Known,
is extracted from lead. The danger of
the process, and the dreadful diftemper
with which thofe employed in it are
often feized, have not yet led to the
difcovery of another white. Less anx:-
ous about the danger of the artiff than
the perfection of the art, they have va-
ried the preparation, to render the colour
lets liable to change. fience the diffe-
rent Kinds of white, viz. white of Crems
in Auffria, white lead in shells, and white
ceruffe. Bur every perfon converfant in
colours knows that the foundation of all
thefe is the cals of lead, more or lets
pure, or more or less loaded with gas.
That they all participate of this metallic
fubftance will indeed be evident from
the following experiment, which demon-
ftrates and determines the alterability of
Colours by phlogiflic vapours.
I POURED


220 ONN.WHIITE PIGMENTS.
I POURED into a large glats bottle. a
r of liver of fulphur, on a. bafis
quantity

of qlkali, fixed or volatile, it makes no
difference. I added fome drops of diftilled
vinegar, and I covered the mouth of the
bottle with a piece of pafteboard cut to its
Lize, on which I difpoted different famples
of crems, of white lead, and of ceruffe, in
oil and in water. I placed another ring of
pafieboard over the firft, and tied above all
2 piece of bladder round the neck of the
hottle with a firong packthread. It is
evident, that in this operation I took ad=
vantage of the means which chemiftry
offers to produce a great quantiry. of phlo=
giftic vapour, to accomplith inflantane:
oully the effect of many years; and,: in
a. few words, to apply to the colours the
very fame vapours to

pour; for it is fully eftabliffied; that the
smoke of candles, animal exhalations of
all Kinds, alkalefcent odours, the electric
effluvia, and even light, furnifh continu-
ally a quantity more orless of matter, not
only analogous, but identically the fame,
with the vapour of vitriolic acid mixed
with fulphur.
Ir it happen that the famples of colour
are fenlibly altered by the phlogiftic va-
pour, then we may conclude with cer-
tainty, that the materials of which the
colour is compoted bear a great affinity
to that vapour; and, fince it is not pof-
fible to preferve them entirely from it in
anyfituation, that they will be more or
lets affected with it, according to the time
and a valiety of circumstances.



AFTER Come minutesconfinuance in this
Vapour,


222 ON. WHIITE PIGMENTS
Vapour, I examined the famples of co-
lours fubmitted to ius infinence, and found
them wholly altered. The ceruffe and
the white lead both in water and oil
were changed into black, and the white
of crems into a brownith black; and
hence thofe colours are bad, and ought to
be abandoned. They may indeed be de-
fended in fome meature by varnith, but
this only retards for a time the contact of
the phlogiffic vapour; for as the varnish
lofes iis humidity, it opens an infinite
number of paffages to this fubtile find.
AFTER having afcertained the inRlab:-
lity of the whites in common ufe, I made
Leveral attempts to dilcover fuch as would
prove more latting; and though many of
thefe attempts were without effect, I thail
give a fuccinet account of the whole,
which may fave a great deal of trouble to
thofe


ON WHITE PICMENTS. 227
a
thofe who with to travel over the fame
field.
 THERE are three conditions effential to
a good colour in painting.
FIRST, That it dilute eafily, and take
a body both with oils and with mucilages,
or at leaft with the one or the other of
thefe fubltances; a circumftance which
depends on a certain degree of affinity.
Where this affinity is too flrong, a diffe-
lution enfues; the colour is extinguished
in the new compolition, and the mats be-
comes more or lets tranfparent or elfe

the fudden. re-action abforbs the fluid,
and leaves only a dry fubltance, which
can never again be foftened. But if the
3
affinity be too weak, the particles of colour

are fcarcely fuspended in the ffuid, and
3
they
or Eteis


224 ON WHIITE PIGMENTS
they appear on the canvals like fand,
which nothing can fix or unite.
THE SECOND condition is, That the
materials of which colours are compoted
do not bear too near an affinity with the
phlogiffic vapour. The experiments to
which I fubmitted whites from lead are
the infallible means of afcertaining the
quality of colours in this respect, without
waiting for the low impreffion of
time.
A THIRD condition equally effential
is, That the colouring body be not volg-
tile; that it be not connected with a fub-
ftance of a weak texture, fufceptible of
a pontaneous degeneracy. This confi-
deration excludes the greater part of fub-
Stances which have received their tint front

1t impoffible to incorporate their finer
parts with a combination more folid.

AFTER thefe reflections, my refearches
were directed, firll, to the five pure earths.
next, to the metallic earths, either pure of
Precipitated by Pruffian alkalit. N. Wen=

Purpofes of painting; but 1 foon perceiv-
ed that it would have the fame fault with
other kinds of earth, and, befides that, it
could not be obtained but at a very con-
fiderable expence.

are little affected by the phlogiftic vapour y
but they refufe to unite with oils or mu-
cilages, and the white is totally extin-
guithed when they are ground with thofe
liquids. I made feveral attempts on earth
of alum, not only becaufe M. Beaume
recommended the ufe of it in painting;
and becaufe it enters into the compofition
of Pruffian-blue; but alfo becaufe it is a
chief ingredient in ochres, and other
earths of that nature, which indicates that
it would unite in a certain degree with
diluting liquors. Notwithllanding, in
whatever manner I treated it, it would
not yield a white. But one will be less
furprifed at this want of fuccess, when it
is confidered, that in the ochres and
Pruffian-blue the earth from alum is. only
the vehicle of the colouring body, whereas
here it is the colour itfelf.
To be convinced of the truth of this
obfer-



ON WHITE PICMENTS. 22)
observation, it is only neceffary to mix
equal parts of this earth, or even of clay
not coloured, with ceruffe or any other
white; the mixture will be fufceptible of
being ground in oil or in gum, without
being extinguithed; it will eafily unite
with any coloured fubltance, and be pro-
ductive of no bad confequences to the
pure earths.
NATURE and art prefent to us a confi-
derable number of carthy compofitions
fufficiently white for the purpofes of
painting; fuch as the JAsPEk white, the
FELDSPAT white, the SCHIRL white, Exc.
But all thefe fubltances, in all the trials
I made, had the fault which I have al
ready mentioned; and oiginating from
the fame caufe. they wanted a fixed co-
louring body, which would not change

when pulverized, nor be extinguished
when dilnted.
THE ultramarine blue, which is ex=
tratted from the blue jafper, and known
by the name of lapis lazuli, feems at firft
view to warrant the poftibility of appro-
priating to painting all the opague half-
vitrified compofitions of the nature of
Jatper.
PREPOSSESSED with this idea, I con-

ceived the hope of producing a true white
lapis; but I foon perceived that the ex-
periment confirmed the principle which
I had laid down from my obtervations on
pure earths, fince it is not the fubitance
peculiar to the jafper which conftitutes
the uhramarine blue, but the metallic
subftance which accidentally colours this
particular Kind of jafper.

Many EREMESER WIESS Is nothing but
the vitriol of lead, prepared by diffolving

into folid tablets by means of guin water.
It is certain that this refembles in no

that it, could be diffeived in vinegar:; but

THE vitricls of lead and bismuth atter

calcarsous tartar which may be of fome
ute in water-colours, the beft earthy falts
on which I have made experiments, may
all, or the moft of them, give a bafe to
some colours, but cannot conftitute by
themfelves a colour ufeful in painting.
ad
Or the firteen Known, metallic fub-
fances, there are nine which yreld white
calces, viz. filver, mercury, lead, tin, an-
timony, bifmuth, zinc, artenic, manga-
nefc.

OF

OF thefe nine fubllances we may pats
over filver and mercury, becaute, though
they yield a very fine white, precipitated
by means of pure dry vegetable alkali,
yet it is foon altered when expofed to the
air; that from filver into black, and that
from mercury into yellow.
Ir is well known that lead gives a very
good white, and one which unites eafily
with oil or fize; but that it is extremely
liable to change, has been my principal
object to prove; and the experiments I
have made, place it beyond contradiction.
I SHALL only add, that if there be a
reparation able to correct this fault, it
should be the precipitation of the earth of
this metal, from an acctous folution, by
the Pruffian alkali; but the white which
refults from this preparation becomes fen-
fibly

Libly brownish, when it is expofed a fers
minutes only to the phlogiffic vapour.
Ir would be therefore unreafonable to
perfevere in the ufe of this fubllance, or
to with to render it fixed; fince the
changes which it undergoes do not alter
Iis nature, and the indeftructible order of
Iis affinities.
THE calx of fin is ealily applied to any
purpofe, and experiences no change from
the concentrated phlogiffic vapour. Thefe
confiderations induced me to endeavour
to obtain this calx perfectly white; and
here follows the refull of my experi-
3
ments.—The Malacca tin calcined gives
a pretty white calx; but, whatever atten-
tion I paid to take off the red furface
which the violence of the fire occafioned,
1i takes always a shade of grey: when it
15

is diluted. Tin calcined by nitre in fu-
tion, gives a tarnifhed and gross cals,

which continued wathings could not de
prive of a yellowith int.
HAviNC precipitated, by means of dry
yegetable alkali, a solution of English tin
in muriatic acid, after the manner of Nr.

Bayen for exuacting the arfenic, I had
a cals of the pureft whitenels, fo light as
to be buoyant on the liquor in the filter,
and to pats through it in fome quanti
ties; but it poffeffes at the fame time a
kind of adherence with the falts, which
makes the particles remaining on the fil-
ter to be incapable of being pulverized,
gummy, femi-tranfparent, and of a yel-
lowith hyc. It is neceitary to diluie it
in boiling water; and afterwards to cal-
cine the fediment flighily, when it has
had sufficient time to fettle.

It is eafily prepared, fince it is only ne-
ceffary to diffolve the bifmuth in nitrous
acid, and precipitate it by means of wa-
ter. It dilutes perfectly in oil and muci-
lage.—But this colour ought to be re-
jected as the moft alterable by the phlo-

in ten minutes in my apparatus, and this

it from this folution, by means of lime-

alone, and with nitre and in all thefe
operations I have obtained an earthy fub-

mixed readily with oil and mucilage;
without loting its colour; and which ex-

Lemi-metal alone in a crucible, placed ho-
Fizontally on the corners of a reverberat

had at firft great hopes from this colour;
as, contrary to all thofe extracted from
the other meials, it became white by
the phlogiffic vapour. There remained,
therefore, but one difficulty to overcome,
vit. to feparate from the manganefe the
portion of iron which it afually contains;
and which infallibly makes the earth a
little yellow. To accomplith this in the
cheapeft manner, I. fubmitted the black

to render its iron infoluble. 1 after-
wards applied vinegar to it, after the ex-
ample of N. de la Peyroufe; and in
precipitating the folution by alkall, I
cafily obtained a pure white precipitate.
But I foon perceived that the facility
with which a colouring body lofes its
phlogifton is no lefs an inconvenience
than that of attracting it, and productive
of the fame alterations.
THE white of manganefe became very
foon yellow when expoted to the air;
and this is not to be afcribed to the iron
contained in it, fince neither the galls
or Pruffian alkali had difcovered any
of it in the folution. This fubliance,
therefore, can be of no ufe in producing
2 white colour for painting.

I can, therefore, recommend to painters

to apprehend, that the low price of ce-
ruffe will always give it the preference
in houfe painting. With regard to thofe
who apply colours to nobler purpofes,
they will not helitate to employ the white
of 2inc. I am aftured that four livres is
paid for a pound of white of crems,
and I believe the white in question, pre-
pared in the manner which I have point
ed out, might be fold for fix.
NI. COURTORS, connected with the
laboratory of the Academy, has already
declared that it is ufed in houfe-paining
lets in regard to its unalterability than its
folubility; and this may be the more
readily believed, as the fowers of 2inc
enter into many compofitions of the apo-
thecary. Al. Courtors has alfo arrived, at
the art of giving more body to this white,
which the painters feemed to defire, and

of making it bear a comparifon with
white lead erther in water or oil. The
only fault found with it is its drying too
llowly when ufed in oil; but fome ex-
periments which I have made, incline me
to believe that this fault may be eafily
remedied, or greatly corrected, by giving
it more body. At any rate, it may be
rendered ficcative at pleature, by adding
a little vitriol of zine (white copperas)
Hlightly calcined.
PAINTERS already Know the proper-
ties of this fall; but perhaps they do not
know that it mixes with the white of
2inc better than with any other colour,
for the reafon that they have chemically
the same bafe. It is prepared by depriv-
ing the white copperas of that fmall por-
tion of iron which would render it yel-
low; which is eafily done, by digeft-

A MIKTURE of this falt thus prepared
may be made on the palette, which will
caufe no alteration in the colour, but be
productive of great effect in a very fmall
quantity.
