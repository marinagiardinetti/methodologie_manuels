Examples amply fufficient to direct a GENiUs
in the leaft apt or inquisitive, not forgetting
Diligence, but laying afide Fear; becaute every
freth Attempt on the fame Subject will evi-
dence an mendment to encourage the Learner.
It would be rath on a fudden to expect Perfec
tion in this Art; yet after a few painful Essavs,
a Pleature fucceeds in the Prospett, and grows
in the Praftice beyond that of any other Acqui-
fition; and fure no one would pare the Means
where the EwD is to defirable. Not one Book
has hitherto appeared in this Country well
fuited to facilitate the Attainment of this ARnr;
yet we are always invited to attend to ample and
learned Instructions to Beginners, where the pre-
liminary Difcourfes often puzzle and confufe
the Ideas more than the Examples they recom-
mend are ever able to eradicate. But fince
Example has made verbal Inftruction expected,
ve here fubjoin fuch as feem to as neceffary for
2 Work of this Kind, viz. Any of the following
Examples being placed before you, a BAcE LEAD
PENCIL and PAPER are all the Requisites need-
ful.— Then flightly skerch the general Propor-
tions from the Object to placed, which carefully
furvey, and alter by rubbing it gently out with
Stale Bread, flightly and cautioully retouching

imitate fuch Parts as appear dark, diffinctly
from thofe which are faint or smaller the frong

line, and when properly given, always denote
a Master's Hand.—Let your greateft ppli-
cation be employ’d in making a perfect Out-
line, for in this principally confifts the Art of
Drawing; this fully attained all Arts are ealy,
and every stady will become delightful. The Our-
line compleated, Light and Shadow becomes your
next Concern, which is a Labour to pleating, that
no Commendation can be given adequate to

the Pleafure a real Prosefor finds in the Exe-
cution of this Art, or rather Science fucceeding
Art.—Beginners are apt to leave the Study of
Out-lines too foon, end so commence Painters;
like thofe who raife a Structure, ere the Foun-
dation be compleated. Light and Sbadow are
produced by Etching or Hatching, Washing, Clare
Oscure, Painting, Modelling, Sculpture, ESc. ESc.
As the firft three are chiefly ufed by Learners.
I shall give a few Flints for the executing each.
And firft of Hatching: Carefully obferve the
Burin, or manner in which the Strokes of the
Original are laid, and keep with Exactness the
Form, not to much regarding their Number;

firft flightly making them all of a Thickness,
and; after by various Retouchings frengthen
them to the Tone of Colour in your Criginal
whether you ufe black or red Chelk, or black
Leed; — Which may be ufed fingly or thus
compounded, working the fainter Parts with
black Lead, and give Strength with black Chalk.
Or finithing your Drapery, Hair and Eye-Brows
in this Manner, and the Fiesh or naked with
red Chalk.—This Method is beft for copying
engraved Prints, which I principally recommend
to Beginners.—Next of Washing or Shading
with INDIAN INK.—Go exactly over your Out
line with a Pen dipped in common Ink, with
clean Htale Bread rub out all Remains of
your black Lead; then mix your Indian Ink, by
rubbing it in an earthen Saucer with Water
till it is pretty black; then take another clean
Saucer and dip your Pencil in the Indian Ink,
and with Water mix it to the lightefs Shade;
as it dries, deepen it where neceffary, till
you come up to the Strength of your Ori-
ginal.— This Method is moft proper to ufe
in Drawing from Mexsotintos or Paintings.
Laftly of CRavoNs, beginning with black
and white.—Lake blue or purple-coloured Paper,
and having exactly formed your Out-line, begin
an the second degree of your Shades, and with
black Chalk darken acenwards.—Then take
white French Chale, to be found at all Colour-
Shops,





Shops, and beighten the lighter Parts to a per-
feet white.—In this Manner all Paintings may be
copied in their proper Colours, by having dif-
ferent Crayons of each Colour, from dark to
light in due Gradations.—And practiting by the
preceding Rule, rolling a Piece of Paper to
a Point, and dozzeling or rubbing each Colour on
the Paper when finished, to prevent their coming
off, which yet will be tender, and should be
kept behind a Glass.
