wants no Mans Eloquence

and lays the whole World
in Subjection to its Charms. I shall not

of Beauties and Perfections, which are
univerfally known and admird; and give

has every where the higheft Reputation.
My Bufinesshere, by way of Preface, is

To guard againft any Offence which
sKilful Painters might be led to take at
the Publication of this little Affemblage
of Instructions, it is declard, that it was
ot intended for them, but for the Tyros
only and Novices in the Art, and fuch

ter to qualify them for this charming
Employment. And it is certain, there
are Thoufands of Perfons in Great Bri-
sian, as well as in other Nations, who
have a greater Paffion for this Art
than they have Opportunity to cultivate
1t. The Country affords but few Pain-
ters, whofe Instructions are of any Va.
lae; and good Pieces of this Kind are
very fare among us; while great Num-
bers of both Sexes, of Fortune and Lei-
fure, who with a Genius for Painting.
are devoted to a Country-Life, languith
away many a heavy Hour for want of
some Intelligence in this Art, which
they might pass very agreeably with a

Undertake not here to celebrate
the Prailes of Painting: Many
learned Nch, who have to
happily treated of the Dignity
38
and Excellence of this charming
Art, have faved me the Labour; fince what
they have faid of Painting in General, is
alfo true of Miniature in Particular. I will
:only add in a few Words, the Peculiaricies
which diftinguish it from every other Spe-
:cies of Painting.
It is more delicate.
It requires a nearer View.
It is not eafily done but in Littls.
It is wrought only upon Velum or Paper.
And the Colours are diluted only with
Gum-water.

2
To fucceed in this Art, a Man should be
perfectly skilled in the Art of Designing or
Drawing. But as moft People who affect
the one, know little or nothing of the
other, and would have the Pleafure of
Painting, without giving themfelves the
Trouble of learning to defign, (which is
indeed, an Art that is not acquired without
a grear deal of Time, and continual Appli-
Cation,) Inventions have been found our to
supply the Place of it; by means of which
a Man defigns or draws, without knowing
how to design.
II. TE firft is Calking. That is, if you
have a Mind to do a Print or Design, in
Miiature, the Back-fide of it, or another
Paper, mult be blacken’d with Small-coal,
and then rubb’d very hard with the Finger
wrapt in a linnen Cloth: Afferwards the
cloth muft be lightly drawn over the Side fo
blacken’d, that no black Grains may remain
upon it to foil the Velom you would paint
upon; and the Print or Draught muft be
faftened upon the Velom with four Pins,
to keep ir from shifcing. And if it be ano-
ther Paper that is blacken’d, it muft be put
between the Velom and the Print, or
Draught, with the blacken’d Side upon the
Velom. Then with a blunced Pin or Nec-
dle, you muft pats over the principal Lines
of Strokes of the Print, or Draught, the
Coniours, the Plans of the Drapery, and
OVeF





3
over every thing elfe that mutt be diftin-
suithed; prefting to hard, that the Strokes
may be fairly marked upon the Velom un
derneath.
III. CoPyiNe by Squares is another con-
venient Method for fuch as are but litrle
skilld in the Art of Defigning, and would
copy Pictures, or other Things, that cannot
be calked. The Mechod is this: The Piece
mult be divided into many equal Parts by
lirtle Squares, marked out with Charcoal, if
the Piece be clearand whicith, and the Black
can be fairly feen upon it; or with white
Chalk, if it be too brown and dusky.
After which, as many Squares of equal Dr-
mentions mult be made on whire Paper,
upon which the Piece muft be defigned;
becaufe if this be done immediately upon
Velom, (as one is apt to mifcarry in the
firff Accempt) the Velom may be foiled with
falfe Touches. But when it is nearly done
upon Paper, it mult be calked upon the
Velom in the Manner before defcribed.
When the Original and the Paperare thus
order’d, obferve what is in each Square of
the Piece to be difigned, as a Head, an Arm,
a Hand, and to forch; and place it in the
corresponding Part of the Paper. And thus
finding where to place all the Parts of the
Piccs, you have nothing to do but to form
them well, and to jon them together. By
this Nicthod you may reduce or cularge
B2
2


4
a Piece to what Compats joupleafe, making
the Squares of your Paper greater or letter
than thofe of the Orrginal; but they mutt
always be of an equal Number.
IV. To copy a Picture, or other Thing,
in the Jame Size and Proportion, another
Method is, to make ule of varnith’d Paper,
or of the Skin of a Hog's Bladder, very
trantparent; fuch as is to be had at the Gold-
beaters. Talc or Kinglats will likewife do
a5 well. Lay any one of thofe Things
upon) our Piece; and, thro' it you will fee
all the Strokes and Touches; which are tobe
drawn upon it with a Crayon or a Pencil.
Then take it off; and fattening it under
Paper or Velom, fet up both againtt the
Light, in the manner of a Windew. and
with a Crayon, or a filver Needle, markout
upon the Paper or Velom yon have put up-
permoft, all the Lines and Touches you shall
fee drawn upon the varnished Paper, Blad
der, Talc, or Ifinglats you have made ule of,
and which will plainly appear thro' this
Window.
After this Manner, making ufe of the
Window, or of Glats expoted to the Light,
you may copy all Sorts of Prints, Defigns,
and other Pieces, on Paper or Velom; lay.
ing and faftening them under the Paper of
Velom, upon which you would draw them.
And is a very good, and a very eaty Con
trivance for doing Pieces of the Jame Size
and Proportion.

If you have a Mind to make Pieceslook
another Way, there is nothing to be done
but to turn them; laying the printed or
drawn side upon the Class, and faftening
the Paper or Velom upon the Back of it:
remembring to let your Lights fall on the
lek Side.
A good Method likewife to take a true
Copy of a Picture in Oil, is to give a
Touch of the Pencil upon all the principal
Strokes, with Lake tempered with Oil; and
to clap upon the Whole a Paper of the fame
Size: Then pafting the Hand over it, the
Touches of the Lake will stick, and leave
the Defign of your Piece expreffed upon the
Paper, which may be calked like other
Things. But you muft remember to take
off, with the Crum of Bread, what remains
of the Lake upon the Picture, before it be
dry.
You may likewife make ule of Pounce,
made of powder’d Charcoal put in a linnen
Rag; with which the Piece you would
copy muft be rubb’d, after you have prick’d
all the principal Strokes or Touches, and
faftened whice Paper, or Velom, underneath.
V. Bur a furer and cafier Hlelp than all
thefe, for one who knows nothing of De
figning, is a Mathematical Compals. It 1s
generally made of cen Pieces of Wood, in
form of Rulers, half a quarter of an Inch
thick, half an Inch broad, and a Foot long,

or more, according as you have a blind ro
draw Pieces of a greater of leffer Size. To
faciluare the Conftruction of this Infirument,
I here exhibt a Figure of it, with an Ex-
planation of the Manner in which it is to
be uied.

This liitle Beard A is to be of Fir, and
cover’d with linnen, or any other Cloth,
becaute the Piece you copy, and the Velom
of Paper you copy upon, muft be fixed
Upon It. Upon this Board muft the Com-
pals allo be fixed, with a large Pin, by the
End of the firtt Foor B, deep enough to
keep it clofe, but not to deep as to hunder
It from turning eafily. When you have a
Mind to reduce Things, place your Origi-
hal on the side of the FoorC, and the Ve-
lom or Paper you would draw upon, on the
side of the Foor B; removing the Velom
or drawing it nearer, according as you in-
tend to reduce or enlarge.
In

In order to enlarge a Piece, you have
othing to do but to change the Places of
your Original and your Copy, placing the
latt rowards C, and the other on the
Sitle of B.
And in both one and the other Method,
2 Crayon or leaden Needle mult be put in
the Foor, under which the Velom lies; and
a Pin, a little blunted, in that over the Ori-
ginal; with which all the Traces are to be
followed; conducting the Pin with one
Hand, and with the other preffing genely.
upon the Crajon or Needle, that marks the
hen the Cravon, or Needle,
Velons.
bears fufficiently upon the Velom, you have
110 Occafion to rouch it.
By this Inftrument you may alfo draw in
equal Dimenfions: But in order to this, the
Compats mult be fixed in another Manner
upon the Board; for if it is to be faftened
upon it by the Middle at D; and your Ori-
ginal and your Copy muft be fix’d on each
Side of this middle Foot, at equal Dillan-
ces; or from Corner to Corner; that 1s,
from C to E, when the Pieces are large.
One may likewife draw feveral Copies at
once of equal and different Dimentions.
VI. THESE are all the Heips I can give
to fuch as are not Mafters of Design. For
thofe that are, they have nothing to do
with them.

Wheng therefore, your Piece is marked
our upon the Velom, you mult pats with a
Pencil of very clear Carmine, ever all the
Praces, to the end they may not be effaced
a5 you work. Then clean your Velom with
the Crum of Bread, thar no Black may re
Inain ipon it.
VII. Voux Velom muft be pafted upon
2 little Plare of Brats or Wood, of the Size
you weald make your Piece, to keep it
frin and ight; but this pafting muft be on
the Edges of your Velomonly, and behind
the Plate For which Purpole your Velom
muft exceed yeur Plate above an Inch on
every Side. For the Part you paint upon,
mult never be pafted; becaufe it would not
only give it an ill Look, but you could not
take it off if you would. Cur off the litle
Shags and Locks of the Velom; and wer
ting the fair Side with a linnen Cloth, dipt
in Water, clap the other upon the Plate
with a clean Paper between them: So
much as hangs over, muft be pafted upon
the Back of the Plare, drawing it equally
on all Sides, and hard enough to ftretch it
well.

IX. As all Colours taken from Earth and
other heavy Matter, are always too coarle,
be they never to well ground, especially for
delicare Work, becaule of a certain Sand
remaining in them; the finell Parts may be
drawn out by diluting them with the Finger
in a Cup of Warer. When they are well
steeped, let them fettle a while: Then pour
out the cleareft, which will be at Top, into
another Veffel. This will be the finelt, and
mult be let dry; and when tis ufed, muft
be dilured with Gum-water, as I shall fhew
hereaffer. This is a very good Contrivance,
especially for Flake-white, in which there is
a chalky Matter; which, like the coarfe and
heavy Paris in other Colours, finks to the
Bottom of the Cup it is Itsep’d in.
X. Ir you mix a little of the Gall of an
Ox, a Carp, or an Eel, particularly of the
laft, in green, black, gray, yellow and
brown Colours, it will not only take away
their greaty Narure, but alfo give them a
Luftre and Brighinets they have not of
themfelves. The Gall of Eels mufthe taken
out when they are skinn’d, and hung upon
a Nail to dry; and when you wouldufe it,
it muft be diluted with Brandr, and a liitle
of it mix’d with the Colour you have dilu
ted already. Thislikewife makes the Colour
Rick better to the Velom, which it hardly
B 6
does


22
does when it is greaty: Moreover, this Gall
hunders it from fcaling.
KL. SoME Colours are made clearer by
Fire, as Tellow OOaker, Brown Red, Ulira-
marine, and Umber. Allothers are darken’d
by it. But if you heat the faid Colours
with a sharp Fire, they change; for the Brown
Red becomssyellow; Vellow Ocker becomes
red; Umber reddens alfo. Ceruse by Fire
takes the Colour of Citron, and is often
called Mofficot. Oblerve, that Fellow Oker
heared becomes more tender than it as,
and foffer than Brown Red. Likewile Brown
Red heared becomes foffer than fine Vellow
Oaker. Both are very proper. The finelt
and cruelf Uhramarine heated upon ared hot
Iron, becomes more glittering; but it waltes,
and is coarfer and harder to work with in
Miniature, when tis purged after this
Bianner.
XII. All thefe Colours are diluced in
little Cups of Ivory, made on purpofe, or
in Sea-fhells, with Water, in which Gum-
Arabic and Sugar Candy are put. For In-
Hance, in a Glats of Water put a Piece of
Gum as big as a Walnut, and half char
Quantity of Sugar Candy. This laft hinders
the Colours from fcaling when thy are laid
on, which they generally do when they want
It, of the Velom is greaty.
This





13.
This Gum-water muft be kept in a neat
E Bortle corked; and never mult you take any
Gour of it, with a Pencil that has Colour
33
55
upon it, but with a Cuill, or fome fuch
Thing
Some of this Water is put in the Shell
with the Colour you would temper, and
dilured with the Finger till it be very fine.
If it be too hard, you muft let it fokten in
the Shell with the faid Water, before you
dilute it. Afferwards let it dry. And do
thus with every Colour, except Lilly-Green,
Sap-Green, and Gamboge, which mutt be
temper’d with fair Water only. Bur Clira
marine, Lake, and Biftre are to be more
:gumined than other Colours.
If you make ufe of Sea-shells, you muft
let them kleep two or three Days beforehand
in Water. Then cleanfe them in boiling hor


Water, mix’d with Vinegar, in order to
carry off a certain Salt, which otherwife
Ricks to them, and spoils the Colours that
are put to them.
KIIl. To Know whether Colours are
fufficiently gumimed, you have nothing to
do but to give a Stroke of the Pencil upon
your Iland, when they are dilured, which
dries immediately : If they chap and fcale,
there is too much Gum, if they rub out by
pafting the Finger over them, there is too
little. It may be feen likewife when the
Colours are laid on the Velom, by paffing
the


14
the Finger over them. If they flick to it
like a Powder, it is a Sign there is not Gum
enough, and more muft be put in the Water
with which you temper them. Take Care,
though, you do not put too much; for that
makes the Colour extreamly hard and dry.
It may be known likewife by their Glewiness
and Brightness: 50, the more they are gum-
ined, the darker they paint: And when you
have a Mind to give a greater Strength to a
Colour, than it has of ittelf, you have nothing
to do but to give it a great deal of Gum.
KIV. PROVIDE yourfelf with an lvory
Pallet, very finooth, as bigas your Hand;
on one Side of which the Colours for the
Carnation, of naked Parts of a Picture, are
to be ranged in the following Manner. In
the Middle put a great deal of White, pretty
largely (pread; becaute it is the Colour moff
made ufe of. And upon the Edge, from the
Left to the Right, place the following Co-
lours, at a little Diftance from the White.
Mafticot
Durch Pink
Orpiment
Fellow Oker
Green, composed of Verditer, Durch
Pink, and Whire, in equal Quan-
tities.
Blew, made of Ultramarime, Indigo
and Whice, to a great Degree of
Paleness.
Ver





15.)
Vermillion.
Carminne
Bittre, and
Black
On the other side of the Pallet, pread
Lorme White in the fame manner as for the
Carnation. And when you have a Mind to
Paint Draperies, or other Things, place near
the White the Colour you would make em
of, in order to work as I fhall thew hereafier.
XV. THE UUfe of good Pincils is a great
Matter. In order to make a good Choice,
wer them a little; and if the Hlairs keep
clofe together, as you turn them upon the
Finger, and make but one Point, they are
:good: But if they clole not together, but
make feveral Points, and some are longer
:than others, they are good for nothing; not
:for dotting in particular, and leaft of all for
Carnation. Whenthey are too tharp point-
red, with only fouror five Ilairs longer than
the reft, yet clofing all together, they are,
notwithllanding, good; but they muft be
:blunted with a Pair of Scizzars, taking care
fat the same time you do not clip away too

3r
 much. Tis proper to have two or three
fors of them; the largeft for laying the
Grounds, and Dead-colouring; and the fnall-
:et for smissing.

To bring the Hairs of your Pencil tojoin
clofe together and make a good Point, you
I mult ofen put the Pencil juft between your
Lips


16
Lips when you are ar Work, moiftening
and prefting it clofe with the Tongue, even
when there is Colour upon it; for if there
be roo much, some of it is taken off by this
means, and enough lek for giving fine and
equal Touches. Yow need not apprehend
this will do you any Harm. None of the
Colours for Miniature, except Orpiment
(which is Poifon) when they are prepared,
have either ill Tafte or ill Quality. This
Expedient muft especially be ufed for detting,
and for simmshing, particularly the naked Parts
of a Picture, that the Toucks may be neat
and fair, and not too much charged with
Colour. As for Draperies and other Things,
as well in dead-colouring as in finishing, is
fufficient, in order to make the flairs of your
Pencil join well, and to unload it when it
has too much Colour, to draw ir upon the
Edge of the Shell, or upon the Paper you
mult put upon your Workcoreff your Hland
Ofl, giving fome Strokes upon it before you
work upon your Piece.
XVI. To work well in MMimature, you
mult do it in a Room that has but one Win-
dow, and fix yourfelf very near it, with a
Table and a Desk almoft ashigh as the Win
dow; placing your felf in fuch a Manner,
that the Light may always come in on the
left Side, and never forward, of on the
Right.
XVIl





17
XVII. WHEN you would lay a Colour
on all Parts equally firong, as for a Ground,
you mult make your Mixtures in Shells, and
=put in enough for the Thing you defign 1o
paint; for if there be not enough, tis a
great Chance but the Colouryon mix after-
wards, is too dark or too light.
XVIIL ArTER having spoken of Velom,
Pencils and Colours, let us now thew how
they are to be employed. In the firft Place,
then, when you would paint a Piece, be it
Carnation, Drapery, or any Thing elfe, you
muft begin by Dead-colouring, that is to lay,
by laying your Colours on with liberal
Strokes of the Pencil, in the fmoothelt man
her you can, as the Painters do in Oil; not
giving it all the Force it is to have for a fi
mishing: I mean, make the Lights a littie
brighter, and the Shades lets dark than they
ought to be; becaufe in dotting upon them,
as you muft do after dead colouring, the
Colour is always fortified, and would at latt
be too dark.
KIK. THERE are feveral Ways of Dof-
ting; and every Painter has his own. Some
make their Dots perfectly round. Others
make them a little longith. Others baich
by little Strokes, that Cross each other every
way, till the Work appears as if it had been
wrought with Ders. This laft Mcthod is
the


18
the belt, the boldell, and the foonelt done.
Wherefore I advife fuch as would paint in
Minialure, to ule it, and to mure them-
felves from the firft to dot in the plump and
the soft way; that is to fay, where the Dots
are loft, in a manner, in the Ground upon
which you work, and only to much appears
as is fufficient to make the Work feem dot-
ted. The bard and the dry Way is quite
the reverfe, and always to be avoided. This
is dene by dotting with a Colour much dar
Ker than your Ground, and when the Pen-
cil is nct moiften denough with the Colour,
which makes the Work feem rough and un-
CVell.
XL. Srupy likewife carefully to less and
drown your Colcurs one in another, to that
If may not appear where they disjoin; and
to this end, fokten or allay your Touches
with Colours that partake of borh, in fuch
fort that it may hot appear to be your
Touches which cut and disjorn them. By
the Word Cut, I conceive what manifeftly
separates and divides, and does not run in
and blend it felf with the neighbouring Co-
lours; which is rarely practis’'d but upon the
Borders of Drapery.
XXL. WHEN your Pieces are finilk’d, to
Beigbten them a lirde, gives them a fine Air.
That is to fay, to give, upon the Extremity
of the Lights, fmall Touches with a Colour
yet










19
yet lighter which muft be loft and drowned
5
with the reft.
XXII. WAEN the Colours are dry upon
your Pallet, or in your Shells, in order to
ute them, they muft be dilured with Warer.
And when you perceive they want Gum,
which is seen when they cafily rub off the
Iland or the Velom, if you give a Touch
with them upon ether (as I have faid alrea-
dy) they muft be temper’d with Gum-water,
inttead of pure Water, till they are in a good
Condition.
KXIIL. THERE are feveral forts of Grounds

 for Pictures and Portraitures. Some are
2
wholly dark, compoted of Biftre, Umber.
and Cologn-Earth, with a litde Black and
"Wbite Others more yellow, in which is

mixed a great deal of Oker. Others grayer;
which partake of Indigo. In order to paint.
3
: a Ground, make a Wath of the Colour or
: Mixture you would have it, or according to
 that of the Picture or Portranure you would
copy; that is to fay, a very light Lay, in
which there is hardly any Thing but Water,
in order to foak the Velom. Then pals
another Lay over that, fomewhat thicker,
and ftrike it on very finoothly with large
Strokes, as quick as you can, not touching
twice in the fame Place before it be dry; be
caule the fecond Stroke carries off what has
been


20
seen laid on at the firtt, especially when you
lean a litle too hard upon the Pencil.
XXIV. OTHER dark Grounds are like.
wife made of a Colour a little greenith; and
thofe are moll in Ofe, and the properelt to
lay under all forts of Figures and Portraitures,
becaufe they make the Carnation, or naked
Parts of a Picture, appear very fine; are laid
on very eafily, and there is no occafion to
dot them, as one is often obliged to do the
others, which are rarely made fmooth and
even at the firtt; whereas in thefe one fel-
dom fails of Succets at the firft Bour. To
make them, you muft mix Black, Duich
Pink and White all together, more or lets of
each Colour, according as you would have
them darker or lighter You are to make
one Lay very light, and then a thicker, as
I faid of the firft Grounds. Vou may allo
make them of other Colours, if you pleale,
but thefe are the moft common.
KXV. WREN you paint a Hloly Perfon
upon one of thefe Grounds, and would paint
a small Cloryround the Hlead of your Figure,
you muft not lay the Colour too thick in
that Part, or you may even lay none at all,
especially where this Clory is to be very
bright burlay for the firtt Time with While
and a lirtle Oker mix’d together, of a firt
ficient Thicknels; and in proportion as you
80


28
go frem the Place of the Hlead, put a litrle
more Oker; and to make it lole ir felf, and
dye away, with the Colour of the Ground,
Baich with a free Stroke of the Pencil, for
lowing the Round of the Glory, fomefunes
with the Colour of which it is made, and
fometimes with that of the Ground, mixing
a litile White or Oker with the laft, when
it paints too dark to work with: And do
this till one be infentibly loft in another, and
othing can be seen to disjoin them.
XXVI. To fill an entire Groand with a
Glory, the brightell Part is laid on with a
licle Oker and White, adding more of the
firft, in proportion as you come nearer the
Edges of the Picture. And when the Oker
is not flrong enough (for you muft always
paint darker and darker) add Gall-sone. af
terwards a lixtle Carmine; and, lattly, Biftre.
This firft Laying, or dead-colouring, is to be
made as foft as poffible, that is to fay, let
thefe fhadowings lose themfelves in one and-
ther without Cap or Interfection. Then
the Way is to dot upon them with the same
Colours, in order to drown the Whole to-
gether, which is pretty redious, and a listle
ditficult, especially when there are Clouds
of Glory on the Ground. Their Lights mult
be fortified in proportion as you remove
from the Figure, and finithed, as the reft,
by detting, and rounding the Clouds; the
bright


22
bright and obicure Parts of which muft run
inienfibly into one another.
XXVII. For 2 Day-ky, take Ullramarine,
and a good deal of White, and mix them
together. With this make a Lay, as finooth
as you can, with a large Pencil and liberal
Strokes, as for Grounds applying it paler
and paler as you defcend towards the Hori
2on; which muft be done wich Vermiltion or
Red Lead, and with White of the fame
Strength with that where the Sky ends, or
tomething lels; making this Blew lofe it felf
in the Red, which you bring down to the
Skirts of the Earth, or Tops of floules,
imixing towards the End, Gall-stone, and 2
good deal of White, in fuch a manner that
the Mixture be still paler than the former,
without any vifible Interfection or Parting
between all thefe Colours of the Sky.
XXVIIl. WEN there are Clouds in the
Sky, you may spare the Places where they
are to be, that is to lay, you need not lay
on any Blew there, but form them, if they
are reddith, with Vermillion, Gall-fione and
White, with a liule Indigo, and if they are
more upon a Black, put in a good deal of
the latt; painting the Lights of one and the
ther with Mastrcot, Vermiltion and White,
more or less of any of thefe Colours, accord-
ing to the Strength you would give thenm,
or according to that of the Orizinal you
C0r7.


23
Icopy; rounding the Whole as you det; for
23
f tis a difficuit Matter to lay them very fmooth
at the firlt painting. And if the Sky is not
even enough, you muft dot it alio.
It is at your Plealure to exempt the Places
:of the Cieuds, for you may lay them upon
the Ground of the sky, heightening he
bright Parts by putting a good deal of White,
and forcifying the shadows by uting iufs.
:This is the thercelf Way.
KKIK. A Night or fformy Sky is done
2
I with Indigo, Black and White, mixed roge-
:ther; which is laid as for a Day-Sky. To
this mixture muft be added Oker, Vermilli-
on, or Brown-Red for the Clouds; the Lights

: of which are to be of Mafticot, or Red Lead,
and a little White; now redder, now yel
:lower, at Difcretion. And when it is a tem
peltuous Sky, and Lighreningappears in some
Places, be it blue or red, it is to be done
as in a Day-Sky. drowning and lofing the
whole together at the firtt -forming or dead
colouring, and at the finithing.

S DRAPERTES
XXN.t 1O painta blew Drapery, pit
Tltramarine near the Wbits
upon your Pallet; and mix a Part of one
with the other, rill it makes a fine Pall,
and has a Body. With this Mixture you
muft form the brightelt Parts; and then,
adding more Uttramarine, form tuch as are
darker; and go on after this manner till
you come to the decpeft Plaits, and the
thickeff Shades, where you muft lay pure.
Ultramarine And all this mult be done as
for a Firft-forming or Dead colouring; that

15 to fay, laying the Colour on with free
Strokes of the Pencil, yet as finooth as you
can; losing the Lights of the Shadows with a
Colourneither to pale as the Lights, nor fo:
dark as the Shades. Then dot with the
same Colour as in the firft -forming, but a
small matter deeper; that the Dots may be
fairly feen. All the parts mult be drowned
one in another, and the Plasts appear with-
out Incerfection. When the Ulramarine is
ot dark enough to make the deeper Sha-
dows, how well foever it be guinmed, miy
a lirle Indigo with it to finith them. And
when the Extremities of the Lights are not
bright enough, heighten them with White
and a very lule Uliramarine.

XXXL. A Drapery of Carmine is done
in the fame manner as the blne; except,
that in the darkeft Places there is to be a
Lay of pure Vermillion, before you dead co-
lour with Carmine, which muft be applied
at top, and in the firongeft Shades, it muft
be gumm’d very much. To deepen it the
more, mix a lirtle Biffre with it.
XXKII THERE is likewife made another
Red Drapery, which is firft drawn wich
Vermiltion, wnxing White with it to dead co-
lour the bright Places; laying it pure and
unmixed for fuch as are darker; and addine
Carmine for the grand Shades. Tis finiflid
afterwards, like other Draperies, with the
Jame Colours. And when the Carmine with
the Vermillion don't darken enough, work
with the firft alone, but only in the decpert
of the Shades.
XXXIII. A Drapery of Lake is made in
the Jame Manner with that of Carmine,
mixing a good deal of Whire with it for the
bright Places, and very little for thofe that

 are dark.  is finithed likewile with detting,
but you have nothing to do with Vermillion
in Ii.
XXKIV. Violet Draperies are likewife

done after this Manner; affer making a Mix
y ture of Carmine and Uhramarine, putting

always



3

26
always White for the bright Parts. If you
would have your Vicler be Columbine or
Dove-Colour, there muft be more Carmine
chan Uhramarine: But if you would have
it blewer and deeper, put more Uttramarins
than Carmine.
XXXV. A Drapery is made of a Fless.
Colour, beginning with a Lay made of White,
Vermillion, and very pale Lake; and making
the Shades with the same Colours, ulinglets
White in them. This Drapery muft be very
pale and tender, becaute the Stuff of this
Colour is thin and light; and even the Shades
of it ought not to be deep.
XXXVI. To make a yellow Drapery
put a Lay of Mafficot over all; then one of
Gamboge upon that, excepting the brighteff
Places, where the Aafficot muft belef en-
fire. Then dead colour with Ofer mixd
with a lirde Gamboge and Masticot, putring
more or less of the laft, according to the
Strength of the Sbades. And when thefe
Colcurs don't darken enoush, add Gall-stone.
And Gall-sone pure and unmux’d is ufed for
the thickeff Shides, mixing a littie Biffre
with it, if there be occation to make them
Kill darker. Vou finith by dotting with the
same Colours you dead colour’d with, and
losing the Lights and the Sbades in one an
Otber.

XXXV









i


27
XXXVIl. is you pur Naples-Eeliow, or
Duich Pink, in lieu of Mafficot and Gambege
you will make another fort of Fellow.
KXKVIII THE Green Drapery is made
by a general Lay of Verditer with which
it you find it too blue, mix Mafficot for the
Lights, and Gamboge for the Sbades. Atter-
wards add to this mixture Lilly-Green or
Sap-Greentofhadow with; and as the Shades
are thicker, put more of thefe latt Greens;
and even work with them pure and unmix’d,
where they are to be extreamly dark. You
finith with the fame Coloure, a little darker.
By putting more Vellow, or more Blue
in thefe Colours, you may make different
forts of Greens, as you pleafe.

XXXIN. To make a Mlack Drapery, vou
dead colour with Black and White, and fi=
with with the fame Colour, putting more
Black, as the Shades are thicker; and for
the darkeft, mix Indigo with it, elpecially
when you would have the Drapery appear like
Velvet. Vou may always give some Touches
with a brighter Colour, to heighten the
Lights of any Drapery whatfoever.
XL. A white woolen Drapery is made
by a Lay of White, in which there muft be
a very finall matter of Oker Orpiment or
Gall-Hone, that it may look a little yellowifli.
Then
C2


28
Then dead colour, and finith the Shades
with Blue, a lutle Black, White and Biffre;
putting a great deal of the laft in the darkeft.
XLL. THE Light-Gray is begun with
Black and White, and finith’d with the fame
Colour deeper.
XLII. Fox a brown Drapery, make a Lay
of Biftre, White and a lude Brown-Red;
and thadow with this mixture, made a hitle
darker.
KLIII. THERE are other Draperies, cal-
led variable, becaute the Lights are of a dif

serent Colour from the Shales. Thefe are
moftly uted for the Veftments of Angels, for
young and gay People, for Scarts and other
giry Actire, admitting of a great many Folds,
and flowing at the Pleafure of the Wind

The moft common are the Violet; of which
they make two Sorts, one, where the Lights
are blue; and the other, where they are yel
low.
XLIV. Fon the fult, pur a Lay of Ulira
narine and very pale White upon the Lights,
and Chadow with Carmine, Ulramarine and
White, as for a Drapery wholly Violet; fo
that only the grand Lights appear blue. Vet
they muft be dotted with Violet, in which
there is a great deal of White; and loft in-
fenfibly in the Shades.
XIV.


29
XL.V. THE other is done by putting upon
the Lights only, intlead of Blue, a Lay of
Mafficot; working the reft as in the Drapery
all Violet, excepting, that it muft be docied,
and the ligbt Parreblended with the Badowy,
that 1s, the Tellow with the Violet, with a
Little Gamboge.
XLVI. THE Carmine-Red is done like
the laft; that is, let the Lights be done with
Mafticot, and the Sbades wick Carmine, and
to lose the one in the other, make Ife of
Gamboze.
KLVII. THE Lake-Red is done like that
Of Carmine.
XLViIl ThE Green is done as the Lake;
always mixing Verditer with Lilly or Sap-
Green, to make the Sbades which are not
very dark.
KLIK. SEVERAL other Sorts of Draperies
may be made at Difcretion, always taking
care to preferve the Union of the Colours,
not only in one fort of Cloth or fo, but alfo
in a Groap of feveral Figures; avording as
much as the Subject will allow, the putting,
of Blue near the Colour of Fire, of Green
againtt Black; and fo of other Colours which
cut and disjon, and whofe Union is not
kind enough.
L. SE.

L. SEVERAl other Draperies are made
of foul Colours, as Brown-Red, Biftre, In-
digo, &cc. And all in the fame manner.
Likewife of other Colours, fimple and coim-
pound; the Agreement between which, is
always to be minded, that the Mixture may
produce nothing harth and difagreeable to
the Eye. No certain Rule can be laid down
forthis. The Force and Effect of your Co-
lours are only to be known from Ofe and
Experience, and you muft work according
to that Knowledge.
LI. Linen Cloaths are done thus: After
drawing the Plars or Folds, as is done in a
Drapery, put a Ley of White over all: Then
dead-colour, and finith the Sbades with a
Mixture of Uitramarine, Black and White
uling more or less of the laft, according to
their Strength or Tenderness; and in the
greateft Decpnings put Biffre, mix’d with a
licde White giving only some Touches of
this Mixture, and even of pure Bifre upon
the Extremities of the greatelf Shadows,
where the Folds muft be drawn, and loft
with thereft.
LII. THEY may be done in another man-
her, by making a general Lay of this Mix-
ture of Uhramarine, Black and very pale
Whise; and dead -colour, as I faid before,
with the same Colour, but a little decper.
And


3

And when the Shades are dosted and finith’d,
heighten the Lights with pure White and
lose them with the Deepnings of the Linnen.
But of whatever fort you make them, when
they are finith’d, you muft give a yellowith
Teint of Orgiment and White to certain Pla-
ces; laying it lightly on, and as it were in
Water; to that what is underneath may,
notwichflanding, plainly appear, as well the
Shadows as the Dotting.
LIII. Tellow Linnen Cloaths are done by
purring a Lay of White, mix’d with a little
Oker. Then form and finith the Shades with
Biffre, mixed with White and Oker; and in
the thickeff Sbades ufe pure Biftre. And be-
fore you finith, give some Teints here and
there of Oker and White, and others of White
and Ultramarine, as well upon the Sbades 2s
the Lights; but let them be very bright;
and drown the whole together in detting,
and Twill look finely. As you finith, heigh-
ten the Extremnies of the Lights with Mas-
ficol and White. Vou may add to this Sort
of Linnen, as well as to the White, certain
Bars from Space to Space, as in Turkey-Man-
tuas; that is, small Stripes blse and red with
Ultramarine and Carmine; One of Red be-
tween two of Blue very bright and clear
upon the Lights, and deeper upon the Shades.
Virgins are pretty ofc dress’d with Vails
ofthis fore (by Popess Painters), and Scarts
of this Kind are pat abour Necks that are

bare ; becaute they become the Teint mighty
well.
LIV. Is you would have both thefe Sorts
of Linnen tranfparent, and the Stuff or
other thing that is beneach, appear through
them, make the firtt Lay for them very
light and clear, and mix in the Colour to
fhadow with, a little of that which is under
neath, especially towards the End of the
Shades; and only do the Extremities of the
Lights, for the Fellow, with Mafficot and
While; and for the White, with pure White.
They may be done in another Manner,
especially when you woud have them allto-
gether as clear as Muslin, Lown, or Garwze.
To this End form and finith what is to be
beneath, as if nothing was to be putover it.
Then mark our the light and clear Folds
with White or Mafficot; and a Shadewy
with Biftre and White, or with Black, Blue,
and Whre, according to the Colour you
would make them of ; making the reft fome
what fainter Ver this is not necelfary but
for the Parts that are not to be fo clear.
LV. Crape is done the same Way; ex-
cepting, that the Folds of the Sbades and the
Lights, and the Borders too, are to be mark’d
out with little Filaments of Black upon what
is underneach; which is likewife to be
finifhed beforehand.
E77


33
LVI. WHEN you would make a Stufflike
a watered Tabby, make the Waves upon it
with a Colour a little lighter, or a lictle dar-
Ker, in the Lights and the Shades.
LVII THERE is a Manner of touching
Draperies, which diftinguiffes the Silken
from the Woolen. The latt are more ter-
reftrial and sensible; the others more light
and fading. But it muft be obferved, that
this is an Effect, which depends partly upon
the Stuff, and partly upon the Colours and
for employing thefe in a Manner futable to
the Subjetts and the Deepnings of Painting,
I. will here touch upon their different Ona-
lities.
LVIII. We have no Colour, which par-
takes more of Light, nor which comes
nearer the Air, than White; which thews it.
to be fickle and ffeeting. It may, never-
thelets, be held and brought to by fome
neighbouring Colour, more heavy and Jen-
fble; or by mxing them together.
LIX. Blue is a moft ffeeting Colour: And
to we fee, that the Sky and the remofeft
Views of a Picture are of this Colour but
it will become lighterand fickler, in Propor-
sion as it i5mux’d with White.
6 5.
EX


34
LK. PURE Black is the heaviell and moft
terreftrial of all Colours; and the more of
it you mix with others, the nearer youbring
them to the Eyc.
Nevertheless, the different Dispofitions
of Black and White make alfo their Effects
different: For White often makes Black dif
appear; and Black brings White more into
View. as in the Reffection of Clobes, of
other Figures to be made round, where
there are always Parts that Jy, as it were
from the Eye, and deceive is by the Craft
of Art: And under the White are here
comprehended all the light Colours, as un
der the Black, all the heavy Colours.
Ultramarine 1s, then, foft and light.
Oker is not to much fo.
Mafticot is Very light; and to is Verditer.
Vermillion and Carmine come near this
Qualiry.
Orgiment and Gambege not to near.
Lake holds a certain Mean, rather fofe
than rough.
Duich-Pink is an indifferent Colour, eafily
taking the Qualicy of others. So it is made
terreftrial by mixing it with Colours that
are fo, and on the contrary, the moft light
and fleeting by joiningit with White or Blue.
Brown-Red, Umber, Dark-Greens, and
Biftre, are the heavieft and moft terreftrial,
NeAtto Plack.
IXI.


35
LXL. SKTITUL Painters, who under-
Hland Perspettive, and the Harmony of
Colours, always obferve to place the dark
and sensible Colours on the Fore-Parts of
their Pictures; and the moft light and ffeet-
ing they ufe for the Diftances and remote
Views. And as for the Onion of Colours,
the different Mixtures that may be made of
them, will learn you the Friendship or
Antipathy they have to one another. And
upon this you muft take your Meafures for
placing them with such Agreement as shall
pleate the Eye.
LXIl. For the doing of Lace, French.
Points, or other Things of that Nature, put
over all a Lay of Blue, Black and White, as
for Lmen: Then heighten the Flower-work
with pure Wbite Afterwards make the
Sbades above with the firft Colour, and fi-
with them with the fame. When they are
upon the Carnalion, or naked Parts of a
Picture, or upon any thing elfe that you
would thew through another, finith what is
beneath as if nothing was to be pur over it.
and at Top, make the Points or Lace with
pure Whice, fhadowing and finithing them

with the other Misture
LXIII. Is you would paint a Fur, you
muft begin with a kind of Drapery, done,
if it be dark, with Biffreand White, making
6
the


3
3
the Shadowings of the same Colour, with
lets White. If the Fur be Whice, do it with
Blue, White and a little Biftre. And when
this Beginning or Firtt-forming is done,
inflead of dotting, draw finall Strokes, turn.
ing, now in one Manner, now in another,
according to the Courfe and Flatting of the
Hair. Heighten the Ligbts of dark Furs
with Oker and White; and of the other with
White and a lutle Blne.
LXIV. For doing a Building, if it be of
Stone, take Indige, Biftre and While, with
which make the Beginning or firft Form of
it; and for fhadowing it, pur less of this
latt; and more Biffre than Indige, according
to the Colour of the Stone you would paint.
To thefe you may likewife add a little Oker,
bech for the forming and the finithing. But
to make ii finer, you mult give, here and
there, especially for old Fabricks, blue and
fellow Teints, some with Ofer, others with
Uhramarine, mixing always While with
them, whether before the Firtt-forming
provided they appear through the Draught,
or whether upon it; loosing and drowning
them with the Reft when you finith.
LXV. WAEN the Building is of Wood,
as there are many Sorts, it is done at Dif
Cretion; but the moft ordinary Way is to
begin or fuft-form with Oker, Biffre and
White, and finith without While, or with
Very



very little; and if the Sbades are deep, with
pure Biffre. In the other they add fome-
times Vermiltion, Comeumes Green or Black;
in a Word, juft according to the Colour
they would give it; and they finith with
Dotting, as in Draperies and every thing
cllc.

Of CARNATIONS, of the Was
ked Parts of Painting.
LXVI.JTHERE are in Carnation fo
many different Colourings,.

that it would be a difficult
Thing to give general Rules upon to varia-
ble a Subject. Nor are they minded, when
one has gor, by Cuftom and Practice, fome
Habit of working eafily: And fuch as are
arrived to this Degree, employ themfelves
in copying their Originals, or elfe they
work upon their ldeas, without knowing,
how: Infomuch that the moft Skilful, who
do it with less Reffection and Pains than
others, would likewife be more put to it to
give an Account of their Maxims and
Knowledge in the Matter of Painting, if
they were to be asked what Colours they
made ule of for making fuch and such a Co-
Jouring, a Teint here, and another there.
Never





38
Neverthelels, as Beginners, for whom 1
defign this little Work, want some Inftruc-
sion at the firft, I will thew, in general,
after what Manner feveral Carnations are to
be done.
LXVII. In the firft Place, after having
drawn your Figure with Carmine, and or-
dered your Piece, apply, for Women and
Children, and generally for all tender
Colourings, a Lay of White, mixed with
never fo lade of the Blue, made for Faces,
of which I have told the Compofition: Bur
let it hardly be feen.
LXVIll AND for Men, inftead of Blue.
they put in this firft Lay a little Vermillion;
and when they are old, a little Oker is min'd
ith it.
LKIK. APTERWARDsfollow all the Tra-
ces with Vermillion, Garmine and White,
mixed together; and begin all the Sbades
with this Mixture, adding White in Proper-
tion as they are weaker and putting but
little in the darkeff, and none, in a manner,
in certain Places, where flrong Touches
are to be given; for Inftance, in the Curner
of the Eye; under the Nofe; at the Ears;
under the Chin, in the Separations of the
Fingers; in all the Jomes; at the Corners of
the Nais; and generally in every Part,
whereyou would mark out Separations in
Shades





3
39
Sbades that are obfcure. Neither need you
fearto give to thofe Places all the Force and
 Strength they ought to have as foon as you
begin or firft -formthem, becaute in working
fat cop with Green, the Red you have put
there is always weakned.
LXK. APTER having begun, or firtt
formed, or dead coloured, with Red, make
blue Teints with Ultramarine and a great
deal of White, upon the Parts which jy
from the Eye; that is to fay, upon the Tem
ples; under and in the Corners of the Eyes;
on both Sides the Mouth, above and below;
fa little upon the Middle of the Forehead;
between the Nofe and the Eyes; on the Side
of the Cheeks; on the Neck, and other Pla-
ces where the Fleth has I know not what
blue Caft with ir.
Fellowith Teints are likewife made with
&Oker, or Orpiment, and a lvile Vermillion
mixt with White, under the Eye-brows; on
the Sides of the Nofe towards the Borrom;
a little underneath the Checks, and upon the
 other Parts which rife and come nearer the
E)E.
9r
Tis, especially, for thefe Temts, that the

natural Complexion is to be obferved, in
order to carch ic. for Painting being an
Innntation of Narure, the Perfection of the
Art confifts in the Jultness and Simpliciry
of the Reprefentation, especially in Face-
Painting.

EXKL. WHEN, therefore, you have done
your firft Lay, your Dead-colouring, and
your Temts, you muft work upon the Sbades,
dotting with Green for the Carnations, or
naked Parts; mixing, according to the Rule
I have given for the Teints, a litde Blue for
the Parts which py from the Eye, and on
the other Iland, making it a little yellower
for thofe that are more sensible; that is to
fay, which rife, and come nearer the Eye.
And at the End of the Shades, on the Side
of the Light, you muft blend and lose your
Coiour infenfibly in the Ground of the Car-
nation with Blae, and thenwith Red, accord.
ing to the Places where you paint. If this
Mixture of Green deesnot work dark enough
at firft, pats over the Shades feveral times,
now with Red, andnow with Green always
docting: And this do till they are as they
should be.
LXXII. Awn if you cannot, with thefe
Colours, give the Sbades all the Force they
ought to have, finith, in the cdarkelt, with
Biftre mixt with Orpiment, Oker, or Ver-
million, and fomeumes with pure Biftre,
according to the Colouring you would
make; but lightly, laying on your Colour
very clear.
LKXIII Yow muft dot upon the clear
and bright Places with a lnde Vermillion of
Car


r
41
Carmine, mist with much White, and a very
Sinall Matter of Oker, in order to lose them
with the padowy, and to make the Teints
die away intentibly into one another; taking
Care, as you dot, or batch, to make your
Strokes follow the Turnings and Windings
of the flethy Parts. For tho' the Rule be
to cross always, this Dotting of Hlarching
ought to appear a lietls more here, becaule
It rounds the Parts.
And as this Mixture might make a Co-
louring too red, if it was alwaysto be ufed,
they work likewife in every Part, to blend
the Teints and the Shades, with Blue and a
litde Green, and much White, to mixed as to
be very pale; excepting, neverthelels, that
this Colour muft not be put upon the
Cheeks, nor upon the Extremities of the
clear Parts, no more than the other Mix-
ture upon thefe laft, which muft be left
withall their Light as certain Places of
the Chin, of the Nofe, and of the Fore-
head, and upon the Checks; which, and
the Checks, ought, neverthelels, to be red-
der than the relt, as well as the Feet, the
Hollows of the Ilands, and the Fingers of
both.
Obferve, that thefe two laft Mixtures
ought to be to pale, that the Work shall
hardly be vifible; for they ferve only to fof-
ten its to umte the Teints withoneanother,
and the Shades with the Lights, and to
drown the Traces. Care mult likewife be
takenn,



42
taken, that you work not too much with
the Red Mixture upon the blue Teints, nor
with the Blse upon the others; but change
the Colour from Time to Time, when you
perceive it works too blue or too red, till
the Work be finithed.
LXXIV. THE White of the Eyes mutt be
Shadowed with this fame Blue, and a little
Fleth-Colour, and the Corners, on the Side
of the Nofe, with Vermillion and White;
giving them a little Touch of Carmins.
The Whole is foftened with this Mixture of
Permillion, Carmine, White, and a very fmall
Mater of Oker.
The Apples or Balls of the Eyes are done
with the Nixture of Ullramarine and Wbite
the latt prevailing a little, adding a little
Rifre, it they are yellowith; or a litile
Black, if they are gray. Make the lirtle
black Circle in the Middle, called the Chryf
ral of the Eye, and shadow the Balls with
Indigo, Biftre, or Black, according to the
Colour they are of; giving to each a finall
Touch of pure Vermiltion round the Chryf-
tal; which muft be left with the relt at the
Finithing. This gives Vivacity to the Eyc.
The Round or Circumference of the Eye
is done with Biffre and Carmine; that is to
fay, the Slits or Partings and the Eye-lids,
when they are large and bolds especially
the upper ones; which muft after wards be
1ot


42


fokien’d with the Red or Blue Mixtures
have mentioned before, to the End they
may be loft in one another, and nothing
seem interfected.
When this is done, give a little Touch of
pure White upon the Chrytal, on the Side
of the Lights. This makes the Eye shine,
and gives Life to it.
LXXV. THE Mouth is dead coloured
with Vermiltion, mixd with White; and fi-
nith’d with Carmine, which is foftened as
the reft. And when the Carmine does not
work dark enough, mix a lirde Biffre with
Il. This is to be underflood of the Corners
in the Separation of the Lips; and particu-
larly, of certain Mouths half open.
LKEVL. THE flands, and all the other
Parts of Carnation, are done in the fame
manner as the Faces; obferving, that the
Ends of the Fingers be a little redder than
the relt. When your whole Work is form’d
fand docted, mark the Separations of all the
Parts with little Touches of Carmine and
Orpiment mix'd together, as well in the
EBadorwy as the light Places; but a little
Ideeper and fronger in the Firft; and lose
fthem in the reft of the Carnation.
3
LKKVII. THE Eye-brows and the
5
Beard are dead colour’d, as are the Shades
fof Carnations, and finithed with Biffre, Oker,
Of


44
or Black, according to the Colour they are
of, drawing them by little Strokes the Way
they ought to go, that is to fay, give them
all the Nature of Hair. Th: Lights of them
mult be heightened with Oker and Biftre, a
little Vermillion, and much White.
LXKVIII Fon the Hair of the Head,
make a La: of Biftre, Oker and White, and
a litle Vermiltion. When it is very dark
colour’d, ufe Plack inflead of Oker. After-
wards form the adorwy Parts with the same
Colours, putting lets White in them, and
finith with pure Biffre, or mix’d with Oaker
or Black, by small Sirokes very fine, and
clofe to each other, waring and buckling
them according to the Curling of the Hlair.
The light Parts muft allo be heightend by
Little Strokes with Oker or Orpiment, White
and a lixle Vermillion. After which, lose
the Lights and the Shades in each other, by
working fomerimes with a dark, and fome-
tunes with a pale Colour.
And for the Hair about the Forchead,
thro' which the Skin is feen, it muft be firtt
formed with the Colour thereof, and that
of the Carnation, working and fhadowing
with one and the other, as if you defigned
to paint none. Then form it, and finiffi
with Biftre. The Lights are to be heigh-
tend as the other.
Gray


45
gray Hlair is dead colour’d with Whife,
Black and Biffre, and finithed with the fame
Coloer, but deeper heightening the bright

and clear Parrs of the Hlair, as well asthofe
ofthe Eye-brows and the Beard, with White
and very pale Blue, after having form’d
ythem, as the others, with the Colour of the
Fleth, or Skin; and finith with Biftre.
LXKIK. Bur the mott important Thing
15t0 foken one'’s Work, to blend the Teints
in one another, as well as the Beard and the
Hair about the Forehead, with the other
Hair and the Carnation, taking elvecial
Care not to work rough and dry. and that
the Traces, Turnings and Windings of the
Carnation, or naked Parts, be not inter-
fecded.
You muft likewife accuftom yourfelf to
Apat White in your Colours only in Propor-
Ation as you work lighter or darker. For the
Colour you ufe the second time mult be
always a little flronger and deeper than the
firft, unlets it be for sostening.
LXKK DIFFERENT Colouringsare ea-
fily made, by putring more or less of Red,
or Blue, or Fellow, or Bifre, whether for
the Dead-colouring, or for the Finithing

That for Women ought to be blucith: That
for Children a little red; and both freth and
forid. That for Men ought to be yellower;
especially when they are old.

LXXXL. To make a Colouring of Dealh,
there muft be a firft lay of White and Or.
piment, or very pale Oker: Dead-colourwith
Vermution, and Lake, inttead of Carmine,
and a good deal of Whise; and afterwards
work over it with a green Mixture, in which
there is more Blse than any other Colour,
to the endthe Fleth may be livid and of a
Purple Colour. The Temts are done the
but
Same Way as in another Colouring;
there muft be a great many more blse than
yellow ones, especially upon the Parts which
fy from the Sight, and about the Eyes; and
the laft are only to be upon the Parts which
rife, and come nearer the Eye. They are
in: de to die away one in another, according
to the ordinary Manner; fometimes with
very pale Blse, and fomerimes with Oker
and White, and a lde Vermiltion; foftning
the Whole together. The Parts and Con.
cours muft be rounded with the fame Co-
lours.
The Mouth is to be, in a Manner, of a
97
quite Violer. is dead-coloured, however,
with a lule Vermiltion, Oker and White;
but finithed with Lake and Blse. And t0
give it the deep Strokes, they take Biffre and
Lake; with which they likewife do the same
to the Lyes, the Nofe, and the Ears.
if it is a Crucifix, of some Martyr, upon
whom Blood is to be seen; affer the finith-
ing


47
ing the Carnation, form it with Vermiltion,
and finith it with Carmine, making in the
Drops of Blood a little bright, reffecting
Spark, to round them.
For the Crown of Thorns make a Layof
Sea-Green, and Mafficot. Thadow it with
Biffre and Green; and heighten the clear
and light Parts with Mafticet.
LXKKIl. Isxow is formed, or firtt laid,
with Indigo, a linde Black and White; and
finithed with pure Ludige, heightening it
with White.
LXXXIIL Fok painting Fire and Flames,
the Lights are done with Mafficet and Or-
piment and for the Shades, they mis Ver-
million and Carmine.
LXXKIV. A Smoke is done with Black,
Indigg and White, and fometunes with
Biftre. One may likewife add Vermiltion
or Oker, according to the Colour it is to be
Of.
LKKRV. PEARIsare painted by purting
a Lay of White, and a litle Blne. They
are sbadowed and rounded with the fame
 Colour deeper: A small white Dot is made
almoft in the Middle, on the side of the
Light; and on the other side, between the
Shalow and the Edge of the Pearl, they
8ive


48
sive a Touch with Mafficot, to make the
Reffettion; and under the Pearls is made of
lirtle Shadow of the Colour of the Grount
they are upon.
LXKKVI DIAMONDS are dane with
pure Block: Then they heighten them withf
lixtle Touches of White on the side of the
Light.
It is the fame Thing for any others
fewels you have a Mind to paint: There
is nothing to be done but to change thef
Colour.
LKXKVIl. For making a Fisure o
Gold, fut a Lay of Shell-Gold, and Thadow
it with Gall-stone.
Sitver is done the fame Way; excepting/
that it muft be fhadow’d wich Indigo.
LXXNVIIl THus have 1 particularly
fet down feveral little Matters to help Be.
ginners, for the Method of doing thefe,
and the Colours that are ufed in them, willf
likewife help for such Things as I have not
inctioned, wakking for the Skill and Faci
liry which Time and Experience are ufedto
give to fuch as apply themfelves to this Art.
One great Meansto acquire a Perfection
in it, is to copy excellent Originals. We.
enjoy with Pleafure and Tranquility the
Labour and Pams of others. Bur a Man
muft


49
mult copy a great Number before he is
able to produce as fine Ellects; and it is
better to be a good Copier than a bad Au-
thor.
The Instructions I have given for the
Mixtures and different Tinctures for the
colouring of Carnations and other Things,
may particularly ferve for working after
Prints, where nothing is Keen but Black
and White; though they are not unprofita-
ble when one begins to copy after Pictures
without Skill in the Management of Co-
lours, and without knowing their Force
and Effect. For there is this Differenc:
between Minnature and Painting in Oil,
that in the latt, the Colours are taken upon
the Pallet, juft as they appear in the Pic
ture, where they are laid on ar once
infomuch that neching is to be done but
to confider a little, what will make fuch a
Light, and what tuch a Sbade. But it is
not thus in Mimature, where pretty often
the latt Lay that is applied, does not keep
Is Colour, but takes another from the
Firtt that has been wrought underneath;
or rather, one and the other compose a
Third, which has the defired Effed. And
though, for Example, it be White, Green,
Carmine, Blue, Orpinent, Biffre, &cc. or
which this Colouring is compoted, thefe
Colours, nevertheiefs, do not procdice it,
if you mix them together; for it is not
only


50
only by working, firft with one, then with
another, that the Thing is done. And
when a Man fees this Effect, without hav-
ing seen how it is produced, he mull, at
leaft, be a Conjurer to difcover the Order
and Manner of it, fuppoting that he hath
neither Book nor Matter. For this Reafon
I applied myfelf to particularize fo many
little Instructions in this Macter; and I af-
fure myfelf, that Experience will thew to
tuch as are in a Capacity to make ufe of
them, that tho' they are small, they are not
lets ufefil.

cle is efteemed; and the following, on the
Nature and different Qualiries of Colours;
becaufe the Order and Diftribution that are
made of them, will do much towards
thewing the remote and the near Views,
which deceive the Eyc. And the greateff
Painters of Landskip have always obferved
to place the moft terreftrial and fenlible
Colours upon the firft Lines of their Land-

Kig, erving the lighteff for the Dif.
CanCes.
But that I may not wander from my De-
ign, intlead of general Precepts, I will
Rop to give Beginners some parricular in-
Pructions for Practice.
RC. In the firtt Place, after having or-
dered the Economy of your Landship as of
your other Pieces, you muft form the near-
off Grounds or Lands, when they are to ap-
pear dark, with Sap or Lilly-Green, Biffre
and a lirtle Verditer, to give a Body to your
D2
Co-


52

Colour: Then dos with this Nixture, but
a little darker, adding fomerimes a lttle
Black Co.
For fuch Pieces of Ground as the Light
falls upon, and which are therefore clear
and bright, make a Lay of Oker and Wbite:
Then fhadow and finith with Bifire. In
some they mix a little Green, particularly
for Chadowing and finithing.
There are fometimes upon the Fore
part certain reddith Lands; which are dead
coloured with BrownRed, White and a
lirtle Green, and finithed with the fame,
puiting a little more Green in them.
Fer the making of Grats and Leaves
upon the Fore-ground, you muft, when that
i5 finithed, form with Sea-Green or Verditer
and a ltde White; and forthofe that arevel-
lowith, mux Mafficot. Afterwards (hadow
them with Lilly-Green, or Biftre and Gall-
pone, if youwould have them appear wither’ d.
The Grounds or Lands at a little Dif
fance, are formed with Verditer, and sha-
doured and finifhed with Sap-Green, adding
Biffre for some Touches here and there.
Such as are at a greater Diftance, are
done with Sea-Green and a little Blne; and
Shadow’d with Verditer.
in a Word, the fartherthey go, the more
blncish they are to be made; and the farchelt
Diftances ought to be of Ullramarine and
White; mixing in fome Placesfmall Touches
of Vermiltion.

XCl. WATER is painted with Indigeand
White, and (hadow’d with the fame Colour,
but deeper: And to finith ir, instead of dot-
ting, they do othing but make Strokes and
Traces without croffing; giving them the
Jame Turn with the Waves, when there are
any. Sometimes a litle Green mult be
mixed in certain Places, and the light and
clear Parts heightened with pure White, par-
ticularly where the Water foams.
Rocks are dead-coloured like Buildings of
Stone; excepting, that a lirtle Green 1s
mig’d for forming and fhadowing them.
Blue and yellow Teints are made upon
them, and left with the reft in finithing.
And when there are finall Branches, with
Leaves, Moss, or Grafs, when all is finith’d,
they are to be railed ar Top with Green
and Mafficot. They may be made yellow,
green, and reddiffis for appearing dry, in
the fame Manner as on the Ground. Rocks
are dorted as the reft; and the farther they
are off, the more grayith they are made.
Caftles, old Houfes, and other Buildings
of Sione and Wood, are done in the Man-
her I have mentioned before, speaking of
thofe Things, when they are upon the firtt
Lines. Bur when you would have them
appear at a Diftance, you muft mix Brown-
Red and Vermillion, with much White; and
Shadow very tenderly with this Mixture;
and the farther they are off, the weaker are
1e
D3


54
the Strokes to be for the Separations. If
they are covered with Slate, it is to be made
bluer than the reft.
RCII. TREES are not done till the Sky
be finifhed: One may, neverthelels, spare
the Places of them when they contain a
good Number: And however it be, such as
come near the Lye, are to be dead colour’d
with Verditer mixing fomeumes Oker and
shadow’d with the same Colours, adding,
Lilly-Green. Atterwards you mult work
Leaves upon them by detting without
croffing: For this muft be done with finall
longith Dors, of a darker Colcur, and pret-
ty full of it; which muft be conducted on
the Side the Branches go, by little Tufts of
a litile darker Colour. Then heighten the
Lights with Verditer or Sea-Green, and Mas-
ficot, making Leaves in the Jame Manner:
And when there are dry Branches or Leaves,
they are dead -coloured with Brown-Red or
Gall-fone, with White; and finithed with
Gall-sone, without White, or with Biffre.
The Trunks of Trees are to be dead -co-
lour’d with Oker, Whife, and a little Green
for the light and clear Parts and for the
dark, they mix Black, adding Biffre and
Green for fhadowing one and the other.
Blue and yellow Teints are likewife made
uponthem, and little Touches given here and
there with White and Mafficct, fuch as you
ordinarily fee upon the Bark of Trees.
The


55
which appear among the
The Branches,
Leaves, are done with Oker, Verditer and
White; or with Biffre and White, according
to the Light they are placed im. They mult
be shadow’d with Biffre and Lilly-Green.
Trees, which are at a little Diltance, are
dead coloured with Verditer and Sea-Green;
and are shadow’d and finithed with the fame
Colours, mix’d with Lilly-Green. Whenthere
are some, which appear yellowith, lay with
Oker and White, and funth with Gall-sione.
For fuch as are in the Diltances and re-
more Views, you muft dead colour with
Sea-Green with which, for finishing, you
muft mix Wltramarine. Ileighten the Lights
of one and the other with Mafficot, by small
disjormed Leaves.
3
Tis the moft difficult Part of Landskip;
and, in manner, of Miniature, to leaf a Tree
well. Tolearn, and break one's Iland to
it a little, the Way is to copy good ones;
for the manner of rouching them is fingular,
and cannot be acquired but by working
upon Trees themfelves; about which you
muft obferve to make little Boughs, which
muft be leased, especially fuch as are below
and towards the sky.
And generally, let your Landskips be co-
loured in a handfom Manner, and full of
Narure and Truth; for tis that which gives
them all their Beauty.

Of FEOWERS.
XCIIl. F T is an agreeable Thing to paint
Flowers, not only on account

of the Splendor of their different Cclours,
but allo by Reafon of the little Time and
Pains that are beftowed in trunming them.
There is nothing but Delight in it, and, in
2 manuer, no Applicacion. Yon mann and
bungle a Face, if you make one Eye higher
of lower than another, a finall Nofe with a
large Bfourh, and to of other Parts. But
the Fears of thefe Dilproportions confirain
not the Mind at all, in Flower-Paming;
for unlels they be very remaikable,
they spoil nothing.
For this Reafon
moft Perfons of Qualiry who divert them-
felves with Painting,
Keep to Flowers.
Nevertheless you mult apply yourfelf to
copy juitly. And for this Part of Mini-
ature, as for the reft, 1 refer you to
Nature, for the is your beft Model. Work,
then, after narural Flowers; and look for
the Teints and different Colours of them
upon your Pallet. A little afe will make
you find them eafily: And to facilitate this
to you at the firft, I shall, in the Continu-
2iCe


57
ance of my Delign, Thew the Manner of
Painting fome; for natural Flowers are not
always to be had; and one is often obliged
to work after Prints, where nothing is leen
but Graving.
XCIV. Trsageneral Rule, that Flowers
are defigned and laid like other Figures;
but the manner of forming and finithing them
is different For they are firft formed only
by large Strokes and Traces which you
maft curn at the firtt the way the Small ones
are togo, with which you finith this Turn-
ing arding much thereto. And for finith-
ing them, inflead of hatching or dotring,
you draw finall Strokes very fine, and very
clofe to one another, without croffing; re-
pafting feveral Times, till your dark and
your clear Parts have all the Force you
would give them.
Of ROSES
XCV. A FTER making your firft Skerch,
1 a draw with Carminethe Red-Rose;
and apply a very pale Lay of Carmine and
White. Then form the Shades with the
Same Colour, purting lets White in it: And
lattly, with pure Carmine, but very bright
and clear at the firtt forcifying it more and
more, as you proceed in your Work, and
according to the Darkness of the Shades.
This is done by large Strokes. Then finith;
Work
DS


58
working upon it with the fame Colour by
little Strokes, which you muft make go the
same Way with thofe of the Graving, if it
be 2 Print you copy; or the Way the
Leaves of the Rofeturn, if you copy after
a Painting, or after Nature; loling the dark
in the clear Parts, and heightening the
greatelt Lights, and the brighteff or moft
lightfome Leaves, with Whife and a little
Carmine. Von mult always make the Hlearts
of Rofes, and the Side of the Shadow,
darker than the Reft, and mix a little Indigo
for shadowing the firft Leaves; particularly,
when the Rofes are blown, to make them
seem faded.
The Seed is dead-coloured with Gamboge;
with which a little Sap-Green is mixed for
Thadowing
Rofes ftreaked with feveral Colours,
ought to be paler than others, that the
Nixture of Colours may be better feen;
which are done with Carmine; a little dar.
Ker in the Sbades, and very clear in the
Lights; always batching by Strokes.
For Whire Rofes you muft put a Lay of
White; and form and finith them as the
Red; but wich Black, White and a lirde
Biffre; and make the Seed a litle yellower.
Fellow Rofes are done by purting in
every Part a Lay of Masticot; and Chadowing
them with Gamboge, Call-stone, and Biftre;
heightening the clear and light Places with
Mafticel and Whits.
The


591
The Styles, the Leaves, and the Buds of
all forts of Rofes, are formed with Verditer
with which is mixed a little Mafficot and
Gamboge; and for (hadowing them, they add
Sap-Greek, puttinglets of the other Colours,
when the Shades are deep. The Ourfide
of the Leaves ought to be blewer than the
Infide: Wherefore it muft be dead-colour’d
with Sea-Green, and Sap-Green mix’d with
that for fhadowing, making the Veins or
Fibres on this Side clearer than the Ground;
and thofe on the other Side darker.
The Prickles, which are upon the Stiles
and Buds of Rofes, are done with lirtle
Touches of Carmine, which are made to go
every way; and for thofe that are upon the
Stalks, they are formed with Verditer and
Carmine, and shadow’d with Carmine and
Biffre; making the Bottom of the Stalks
more reddish than the Top; that is to fay,
you mult mix with the Green, Carmine and
pure Biftre.
OF TULIPS
XCVI. P S there are an Infinity of Tulips,
1d different from one another, one
cannot pretend to mention the Colours with
which they are all done. I will only touch
upon the handlomelt, called preaked: And
thefe Streaks are dead -coloured with very
clear Carmine in fome Places, and with dar-
Ker in others; finithing with the fame Co-
D6
lour


60
lour by little Strokes, which mult be carried
the fame Way with the Streaks. And in
others is put a firtt Lay of Vermillion. Then
they form them by mixing Carmine, and
finith them with pure Carmine.
In some they put Florence-Lake over the
Vermillion, intread of Carmine.
Some are done with Lake and Carmine
mixed together, and with Lake alone, or
with White and Lake for the firtt forming;
whether it be Rofe-Pink, or Flerence-Lake.
There are fome of a Purple Colour,
which are formed wich Ulramarine, Car-
mine or Lake, fometimes blewer and fome
times redder. The Manner of doing both
one and the other, is the same: There is no
Difference but in the Colours.
You mult in certain Places, as between
the Streaks of Vermillion, Carmine, or Lake,
Lometmes put Blue, made of Ultramarine
and White, and fometmes a very bright
Purple, which is finithed by Strokes as the
reft, and loff with the Streaks. There are
Jome likewife which have fallow Teints, that
are made with Lake, Biffre, and Oaker,
according as they are. But this is only in
fine and fare Tulips, and not in the common
Cles.
For thadowing the Ectrom of them, they
erdinarily take Indigo and White for fuch
whole Streaks are of Carmine.
For fuch as are of Lake, they take Black
and White; with which, in some Biffre is
ixd;


61
mixd; and in others, Green. Some are
likewife to be shadow’d with Gamboge and
Umber and always by Strokes and Traces,
that turn as the Leaves turn.
Other Talips are likewile done, call’dbor-
dor’d that is to fay, the Tulip isnot ftreaked
but on the Edges of the Leaves, where
there is a Border.
It is White in the Purple.
Red in the Vellow.
Yellow in the Red.
nd Red in the Wbite.
The Purple is laid with Ultramdrine,
Carmine and White fhadowing and finithing
it with this Mixture. The Border is (par’d;
that is to fay, let only a light Lay of White
be put there; and let it be shadowed with
very bright Indigo.
The Fellow is form’d with Gamboge, and
thadowed with the fame Colour, mixing
Oker, and Umber or Biftre with it. The
Border is laid with Vermillion, and finithed
with a very small Mater of Carmine.
The Red is form’d with Vermillion, and
finithed wich the same Colour, mixing Car-
mine or Lake with it. The Bortom and the
Border are done with Camioge and for fi-
nillung, they add Gall-fone and Umber or
Biftre.
The White is thadowed wich Black, Blue,
and White. Indian ink is very proper for
this. The Shadowings of it are very tender.
I produces alone the Effect of Blne and
Whites


62
White, mixed with other Black. The
Border of this whice Tulip is done with
Carmine.
In all thefe Sorts of Tulips, they leave a
Nerve or Sinew in the Middle of the Leaves
that are brighter than the reft. And the
Borders are drowned with the Bottom by
fmall Traces, turning crosswife; for they
muft not appear cut and feparated, as the
reaked or party-coloured.
They make them likewife of feveral other
Colours. When they happen to be such
whole Bottoms on the Infide are black, as it
were, they form and finith them with
Indigo, as allo the Seed about the Nozzle or
Stalk. And if the Bortom is yellow, it is
form’d with Gamboge; and finished by add-
ing Umber or Biftre.
The Leaves and the Stalks of Tulips are
ordinarily form’d with Sea-Green. and tha-
dowed and finithed with Lilly-Green, by
large Traces all along the Leaves. Some
may likewife be done with Verditer, ixing
Masticot, with it, and fhadowed with Sap-
Green, that the Green of the Shades may
be yellower.
The EMONY, or WINDFLOWER.
KCVII. THERE are Several Sores of
them as well double as fingle.
Thelaftare ordinarily without Streaks. Some
are made of a Purple Coour, with Purple
and


63
and White, shadowing them with the same
Colour, some redder, others blewer; some
times very pale, and fomeimes very dark.
Others are form’d with Lake and White,
and finithed with the fame, purting lets
White some without any White at all.
Others are form’d with Vermillion, and
thadow’d with the fame Colour, adding
Carmine.
We fee likewife white ones, and some of
2 Citron Colour. The latt are laid with
Mafficot; and one and the other fhadow’d
and finith’d fomerimes with Vermillion, and
fometimes with very brown Lake, especial
ly near the Seed, at the Borrom; which is
often likewife of a blackifh Colour, that 1s
done with Indigo, or Black and Blue; mix-
ing for fome, a little Biftre. and always
Working by very fine Strokes and Traces,
and lesing the Ligbts in the Shades.
There are others that are brighter and
clearer at the Bottom, than any where elfe;
and fomeumes they areperfedly white there,
though the reft of the Flower be dark.
The Seed of all thefe Emonies is done
with Indigo and Black, with a very litcle
White; and thadowed with Indige; and in
Some, tis railed with Mafticot.
The double Emonies are of feveral Co-
lours. The handfomelt have their large
Leaves ftreaked. Some are done, that 1s,
the streaked or party-coloured, with Vermil-
lion, to which Carmine is added for the finith
ing


64
ing; thadowing the reft of the Leaves with
Indigo, and for the fmall Leaves within,
a Lay is put of Vermillion and White, and
they are thadowed with Vermillion, uxd
with Carmine, mixing here and there fome
fronger Touches, especially in the Heart
of the Flower, next the great Leaves on the
Side of the Shadow. They finith with Car-
mine, by little Strokes and Traces, turning
the fame way with the mixt, or Party-Co-
lours, and the Leaves.
They form and finith the Streaks or Party-
Colours of fome others, as well as the
small Leaves, with pure Carmine. leaving
nevertheless, in the Middle of the laft a
little Circle, in which is laid dark Purple,
which is loff with the Reft. And when
all is finith’d, they give fome Touches
with this fame Colour round about the
finall Leaves, especially on the side of the
Shadow  drowning them with the large
ones, the Remainder of which is shadow’d
either with Indige or Black.
in fome, the fmall Leaves are done with
Lake or Purple, tho' the Party-Colours
of the large ones be done with Carmine.
There are others, whole mixt Colours
are done with Carmine, in the Middle
of moft of the large Leaves putting in
some Places Vermillion underneach; and
lesing thefe Colours with the Shadows of
the Bottom; which are done with Indige
and White. The fmall Leaves are laid
with

with Mafficot, and shadow’d with very
(dark Carmine on the Side of the Shade,
and with very clear on the Side of the
Light; leaving there, in a Manner, pure
Mafticot; and giving only some little
Touches with Orpiment and Carmine, to
ifeparace the Leaves; which may be Chadow’d
fometimes with a litle very pale Green.
There are Double Emomes painted all
Red, and all Purple. The firft are form’d
Twith Vermillion, and Carmine, in a Man-
tner, without White, and shadow’d with
pure Carmine, well gumin’d, that they
may be very dark.
Purple Emonies are laid with Purple
and White, and finithed wich White.
In a Word, there are double Emonies,
as there are fingle ones, of all Colours;

I should never have dons, were 1 to fet
down here all the Flowers that may be pain-
red. But I have mentioned enough, and
t00 many to give an Idea of others; and a
Dozen would have been fufficient, were one
always to work after Nature; for then there
would be nothing to be done, but to paint
what one fees. But I thought, that as
Prints are molt frequently copied, it would
be pleating to find here the Colours, with
Which different Flowers are done. How-
ever, to finith as I have begun, every one
i5 at Liberty to take and to leave what he
thinks proper.

Serpents, and all Sorts of Reptiles, are to

The Taite of Painters is, neverthelels,

of the laft is meagre and dry. Others ufe &

Time.
Iisberter defended likewife againtt
the Injuries of Time; and the Right of
Birth muft be granted it, and the Glory of
Antiquity.
But Miniature likewifehas its Advantages;
and without repearing fuch as I have men
tioned already, tis neater and more com-
modious. You may eafily carry all your
Implements in your Pockers, and work
when and wherever you pleafe, without
Tuch a Number of Preparations. Vou may
quit it and refume it when and as often as
you will ; which is not done in the other
in which one is rarely, to work dry.
But obterve, that it is in one, and the o
ther, as in a Play; in which the greateft or
lealt Perfection of the Actors does not
confifl in playing high or low Parts; but
in playing extremely well the Parrs they
undercake: For if Hle, who has the loweft
Charalter, acquits himfelf better than ano-
ther who acts the Hero, doubtlels he merns
greater Applanfe.
Tis


86 
Tis the same Thing in the Art of Paint
ing. Iis Excellence does not depend upon
the Greatnels of the Subjett, but upon the
Manner in which it is handled. Hlave you
a Talent for one Thing, don't throw your
self inconfiderateiy upon another: And if
you have received from Heaven some Spark
of this delicate Fire, know wherefore it is
given you, and cherifh and improve it. Some
catch the Airs of a Face well: Others fuc
ceed better in Landskips Some work in
little, who cannot do it in large. Some are
skill’d in Colours, who know little of Design.
Others, lattly, have only a Genius for Flow
ers. And even the Bafans got themfelves
a Fame for Annnals; which they touched
in a very fine Manner, and bewer than any
thing elfe.
Wherefore let every one be content with
hus own Genius, without affecting the Ta-
lent of another, and taking a Flight beyonl
his Strength; for it is very idle to force Na-
ture to give us what the has refuled us: And
it concerns our Prudence, as well as Mo-
defty, not to take it in our Hleads to thew
an Excellence we have not; for this were to
ditcover our Imperfections, and to labour
to our Shame. On the contrary, it is no
Difgrace to you, that you don't poffets alone
all the Parts, which have given Reputation
to great Painters. Every one of them had
his Perfection and his Weakness; and every
one of usought to be content with his Por-
tion:

tion. The main Point is to cultivate it with
Care.
And though this little Book will certainly
contribure thereto; yet I prefent it you only
as a Supplement to better Meas. With-
out doubt, one may learn more advanta-
geoully under an excellent Mafter, from
whom one might receive all the proper
Rules and fine Maxims of the Art, and by
whom one might fee them put in Practice.
And though the Contrivances for Drawing,
which I have fet down at the Beginning,
are infallible, yet Tis much better to get a
Faculry in the true and genume Art of it:
For if you have not, to lupply this Defed,
a very peculiar Genuis, and an extraordi-
nary Juftness of Eye and Iland, draw your
Pieces as corretly as you may, Twill be a
Ilazard bur they are spoild in the End, and
have neither Proportion nor Beanty; be.
caufe in the Application of the Colour, you
very cafily lofe the Srokes and Traces; and
not without great Difficulty can you reco-
ver them, if you underfland not fomething
of Drawing. I earneftly exhort, therefore,
all Lovers of Painting, to learn to draw cor-
rectly, to copy indefaugably, and with the
greatelt Exactnels, good Originals, in a
word to rife by eafy and ordinary Steps to
the Perfection of this charming Art, the
Rules of which, like all otiiers, are foon
learnt; but that is not enough. They muft
be put in Execution. The Tbeory is nfelets,
with


88
without the Praftice; and the Prattice
without the Theory, is a blind GGuide, which
leads us out of the Way, inflead of con
ducting us whether we would go. But to
understand well what one would do, and to
do well what one underttands, is the true
Way to do and underftand a great deal in
Time; and of a good Scholar to become an
excellent Mafter.
For what remains, I fet not up for fuch
a One. And yer 1 can affure fuch Perfons
as will take the Trouble to enter into this
litte School, with fome Inclination and
Apinets to learn, that they will have no
Caufe to repent it. For though they should
Rtay in it with no Pleafure, I believe, at lealt,
they would not go our of it without some
confiderable Advantage.

Por of whice Wine-Vinegar. After having
broken it well in a Mortar, boil it half an
Hour. Thenfals or ftram it through a very
coarle Linnen Cloth, and fet ir again upon
the Firc. Take another lintle Pot of Whice
Wine- Vinegar, and in ir fleep or temper
eight Ounces of Allam. Pur this Allum, fo
temperd, on the other Liquor, and fir it

and a quarter of an Ounce of rnatto, both
freduc d to Powder fepararely; and let this
Mixture boil away to half, or, in better
better Terms, till it railes a black Scuin,
Iand be very red; for by means of Boiling it
Stakes a Colour. Take it off the Fire; and
Isrew in it half an Ounce or three Pinches
fof pulveriz’d Roach—Allum, or of Roman
Allum, which is reddith and better; and

half a quarter of an Hour after, ftram it
Ithrough a Linnen-Cloth into a glaz’d Vef

 of glaz’d Porringers; where let it fettle for
twelve or fifieen Days, and you will fee on
 the Surface a mouldy Skin. which muft be
Itaken off with a Sponge, and the Matter
underneath expos’'d to the Arr. When the
Water at the Top is evaporated, dry the
Matter which refts at the Bortom; and
gund it upon a very hard and very fmooth
Piece of Marble or Porphyry. and then
fift it through a very fine Scarce.
Obterve thar the Quantity of thefe Ingre-

till you have made the Paftel with which ths
Lapis is to be incorporared.
For the making of this, take a quarter of
a Pound of Bee-wax, a quarter of a Pound
of Turpentine, the same Quanity of Robn,
and the fame of Linfeed Oil. Nele the
whole together over a llow Fire, and when
it begins to boil, pour it into a glard
Pot. This is the Pafte of Ultramarine, of
which take a Quantny equal to that of the
Lapis, and Kneadit together upon the Por
phyry or Marble. When they are well in
corporated, leave them for one Night. And
afterwards, to bring out the Ulframarine,
which

through one of the finell Scarces, as I faid
before. When they are well incorporated,
and have been let alone for Twenty four
Hours,

Hours, take Spring- Water and no other;
and with this Warer kneading your Palte
well, you will fee the firft blue Tincdure
come out, which is the finell and beft. Do
thus three times, always kneading with
Spring Water. Finally, for the laft Operation,
take spring-Warer, and make it luke-warm;
With this Knead the Remainder of the Com

ring both into an Alembick, and diftilling
them, you will find at the Botrom the Gold
which was in the Lapis.
Some Knead their Pafte all at once in 2
Veffel full of Water luke-warm, into which
goes the Uhramarine which they dry in
the Sun. They likewife leave the Lapis,
for the Space of a Monch, incorporated with
the Palle, before they draw any Oltramarin
from it; and put in the Pafte, instead of
Linfeed Ol and Turpentine, Ol of Turper

bruife the Lilly Flowers in a Mortar, and
pour upon them a little of this yellow
Water, according as you would make the
Green lighter or darker. Afterwards ftrain
the Juice through a Bag or Cleth made of
Goar's Hair, (for Linnen takes all the Co-

To know whether it be dry, pats the
Tooth a lirtle over some Places. If it does

a Sigh it is not dry.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIVE
4 t DSCI S
FOR THE
ART of DRAWING

HE ingenious Author of the
preceeding little but valuable
Treatife, has laid down feveral
Rules for delincating or copying
Pictures or Prints, by fuch as
could not draw, knowing very well that the
Performance of the former would be very
deficient withour the Practice of the latter,
and he recommends it as the furelt Way, to
excel in that charming Art of Painting in
Miniature, of which he has to freely and in
genuoully given tuch fulland plain Inftructions.
It is to be admired that moft Perfons from
their Infancy, have a Fondness for Pictures,
and Children love to buty themfelves, with
draw


112
Drawing, Colouring, and handling a Pencil.
but this Fondnels for the generaliry wears off
by Degrees, and is by moft quire neglected.
The chief Reafon of which, as I prefume,
is the Trouble and Pains they apprehend
will attend the Acquifition thereof.
It is certain that every one is not endued
with a Difpofition or natural Inclination,
to that ingenious Art, hor can it be artain’d
by Labour and Pains without a Genius.
But such as find them felves dispoted, should
by all means come to a Refolution to attempt
the Practice thereof
Parents therefore would do well to watch
and obferve diligently the Inclination of
their Children, and finding that by Inflind
they thew a natural Genims, and Capacity
for Ingenuity, when of their own Accord
they will take Delight in drawing, fhadow-
ing and finithing any Thing they attempt
to copy, and feem to take a Pride in their
Performances. They should by all means
be encouraged, and be instructed by a good
Mafter, in the beft Manner, in the funda-
mental Rules and Precepts requitite to be
Known in the Progress and Practice of
either Drawing, Defigning, or Paumting.
It frequently happens that a bright
Genius, an Artiff born, has no Opportu-
nity to receive the Infiructions of a Malter,
or is by Diftance in the Country de-
prived of the Converfation with Artifls,
and


113
and ingenious Practicioners his only Way
is then to furnith hunself with fuch Books
that may guide him in his Purfut after thar
Knowledge he fo fondly arns at; and for
th: Benefit of fuch thefe Leffons are inten
ded, not doubring they will meet with the
tame Encouragement and Reception by the
Ingenious, as the preceeding Work, viz.
The Art of Painting in Mimature, has done,
to which fourth Ediion I have added thefe
infiructive Leffons, for the Art of Drawing,
as brietly, plain and ealy as poffible.
II
UCH as intend to make themfelves
18 compleat in the Art of Drawing, should
firft learn the Principles of Geomerry and
Perspettive, and thereby inform their Minds
of true Symetry and Proportion; this being
a Subject to be mer with in Books wrote by
skiifal Arcifts for that Purpofe, I shall for
Brevity Sake ouut enlarging upon it.
The common Rules for Beginners are
commonl; to draw the particular Members
of the Bodies of Men, and firtt of all: The
Pace or Head is attempted by drawing
an Oval, or the Shape of an Egg, with the
feveral Dimentions of the Cross, by which
a Learner may underfland the better to ex-
press the Turnings and Motions of the Pace
in the different Attaudes, hereafter exem-
plifyed.
T


174
To this Oval for the Hlead or Face belong
the Eyes, Eyc-brows, Nofe, Mouth, and
Ears; and to place them in their proper
Situations, the Cross is drawn for that
Purpofe.
After you have formed an Oval, drawa
Perpendicular down the Middle, this cross
again in the Middle with a diametrical
Line, which you divide in five equal Farts,
each being the Breadch of one Eye. This
is called the ocularline, on which you place
the Lyes, and is with the Perpendicuar,
which gees from the Top of the Forehead,
through the Middle of the Nofe, Mourh,
and Chin, called the Crofs, upon which the
Lyes, Nofe, Mouth, and Ears, are to be
placed in their proper Situations, as jes
may obferve in Fig. 4. But for the better
Apprehention of fuch as are unacquainted
with the ule of the Crots in the Oral, or
with the many Varrations of the fame, as in
Turnings and Motions of the Head, an
Experment has been found, to make the
ute of the Crots more plain and incelligib:e,
which is this Have a Piece of Weed
turned in the Shape of an Egg, as in
Fig. 1. Then draw a Line from Point to
Point lengthways, through the Bidft of the
Esg, as in Fig. 2. Divide this in two equal
Parts, by cutting a right Angle as you fee
Fis. 3.
Then having drawn the Eyes,
Nofe, Mouth, 6sc. in their proper Place,
you may by the Pofition of the Ess,
see the
Decli-


115
Declination of Inclination of Faces, and
according to the Pofition of Fig. 4. you will
see it fronting. Turning the Egg or Oval
alittle from the left to the right, the ftraight
perpendicular of the Crots will change and
prelent itfelf in an Arch, as in Fig.g. ac-
cording to which you project the Nofe
beyond the round of the Oval, and place
the reft of the Members of the Face in their
proper Lies, as in Fig. 6. The same 1s
to be obferved in turning the Figure of the
Oral the contrary Way, as in Fig. 7. Again,
the Oral inclining downward, the Crots
will appear as in Fig. 8. And the Face
looking down as in Fiz. 9. The Oval
being turned backwards, the Crots will
change again, as in Fiz. 70. And a Face
drawn according to thole Lines will appear
like Fig. 7r. After this manner you may
form a Variety of Faces, except thofe which
are fideways, which are commonly drawn
by means of a Perpendicular, as you fee in
Fis. r2. upon which you place the Forehead,
Nofe, Mouch, and Chin; ler them be in
what Difpofition they will. See Fig. 1z.
Thefe are the neceffary Rules for delign-
ing or drawing a Face, which if well ob-
ferved and practifed, will in a lictle Time
furnith a Learner with lively Ideas to Jraw
Faces, with good judgment, and give them
mafterly Strokes and Tonches, of which
otherwife, by meerly drawing or copying
after Prints, he would have been unacquaint-
III.
ed with.


116
III
A VING advanced and mounted the
1 firlt Scep, and the young Praditioner
is well grounded in drawing the Oval and
Face, he may then exercile humfeif, to copp
with great Care and Diligence, after good
Draughts and Prints. The former being
the molt proper for fuch as incend to exer
cife the Art of Painting, and the larter for
such as propofe to practice Erching of
Graving; beginning with fuch as are caff
andgeing forwards to fuch as are more dit
ficult, and having arrived to some Perfection
1i1 this, he may adventure to copy affer
Panrings, and to contract large Pictures
inro acall, obferving a due Proportion; and
by diligent Practice he will accuftom him-
felf to quets well, and acquire a free and
fure fland in Defigning
Next to this a young Practitioner may
venture upon copyingafter Figures of Plast
ter of Paris, which is more difficult than
either drawing after Prints or Paintings,
and shall be more fully treated of in its pro-
per Place.
The beft Patternsto draw or copy after,
is Life afelf, or all natural Things. Here
an Arrift has a large Field to range in, and
he need never be idle, but may always find
innumerable Subjects to improve his Talent;
which can not be better done than by Dili-
gence and Application.

Now come to the Practice of the Artof
- Drawing itfelf, and firft of drawing after
Draughts, Prints, or Pictures: You muft
frlt of all oblerve to fix your Principal in a
proper Light, to as to fee in diffind and
plain, placing it at a proper Diltance accor
ding to the Largeness of the Picture or
Draught you defign to copy, putting it
Rraight before you, and not flat, for then
you would fee in forethorten; the Paper
vou draw upon fix, five or fix double, on a
Board, holding that on your Knees, with
which you elevate it as high as you would
have it Thus you will the beccer compare
your Draught with the Principal beforeyou,
which otherwife in cafe your Draught lay
far, you could not do to well. Thus being
fixed for to begin your Piece, guets firft the
Middle of the Picture, or whatever you
intend to copy after, and make a Mark with
your Coal, in the Middle on your Paper
From this Mark j on will guets at the pro-
per Diftances of the Figures difperted in the
Pieces, if there be more than one, and by
taking Heed of the cantal Strokes with
free and flight Touches, you will foon fee
whether the Poficion of your Figures be
jult, leaving the small Breakings or Partings
to the next Drawing; and thus by Patience
and Pratice you will not only readily, but
alfo


118
alfo judicioully attain with Delight to your
Purpofe.
Having made a rough Skerch, examine
whether the Dilpofition and Actions of
the Figures, anfwer thofe in the Prici
pal before you; correct and amend fuch

Parts as you fee amiss, by adding of taking
off, till you find it antiwer yon Purpofe, and
having made thus a rough Skeich, you may
proceed, and draw it neater and berter, ob-
ferving the various Turnings that reprefen
themielves, either in the Actions or Drapery,
taking fleed not to make the firtt Skerch
worfe or fpoil it, by being about to make it
better, which may loon happen, if due Care
is not taken in preferving that Difpofition
you approved of before, and having thus
the second time, drawn your Sketch over
with Charcoal, examine and correct it affer
the Principal, and fuffer not a Fault to pats
withour Correction; for it will be more for
your Honour to make one good Draught,
than an Hundred withour Obfervation or
judgment.
In this cafe it is proper for an Arrift to
divere himself between Whiles, by Reading
Mulick, or looking over of Prints; then
taking a freth View of his Performance and
examining it, he may difcover a Fault he
did not fee before.

V.
N drawing after Figures of Plaifter of
A Paris, you muft choofe a proper Light.
The Room you draw in should be large and
have a Light northwards, to high, that the
Shade which your Figure makes upon the
Ground, be equal, or little lets than the
Height of your Figure you are to draw
Aftet.
You may alfo draw conveniently by the
Lamp, which fome Artifts prefer before
Day-light, becaufe the Shades appear more
rongand Charp, for this Purpofe they hang
a Lamp at a convenient Hleight, well pro-
vided with Oil and divers Wicks, and to
prevent the Light preading itfelf too much,
but remain more conflant, they put some
Oil Paper, through which the Light can-
not fhine, behind it, and thereby it preads
the fronger upon the Model they copy.
Set yourfelf from the Figure you are to
draw, three Times as far as it is high, in
such a Manner, that your Eye may in a
Rraight Line, behold the Model, hangings
Plumb-line before it; and having drawn a
erpendicular Line on your Paper, jou ob-
ferve what comes either on the one Side or
other, to your View, and then make a
rough Skerch of the Pofition of the Figure
What I
in the beft Manner you are able.
have here faid of drawing after Plaifier of
Paris,


120
Paris, by the Lamp, is not to be obferved
in General, for as it cafts flrong and hard
Shades, they are judged not to nacural and
sweet as those caufed by the Light of Day,
and are therefore not approved of by the
generality of experiencd Arcifts. And in
cafe they do draw by the Lamp, they put
a Frame with Oil Paper, between the Wio-
del and the Light, and ther by break the
Harfhness of the Shade: Yon muft fer allo
a whice or gray Paper behind the Model,
that you may perceive the Reffexions the
Detter.

V CHas would make a further Progress
D and Improvement in Drawing, mult ne
cellarily ffudy Anaromy, elpecially as far 2s
It relates to the Mufcles. An Artift having
the fundemental Knowledge in this Study
will foon apprehend the regular Motion of
the Members in the Hluman Body, when
otherwif: he will be in the dark, and not
able to give any Reafon or Diftinction why
this orthat Mufcle, is in ether this or that
Pofition, Swelling, or Contraction. The
Mutcles which are the principal Caufe of
the changeable Motions or Poftures of the
whole Body are chieflythefe: 7. Thole Be
hind che Ilips. 2. Thofe of the Loms. 2.
Thofe of the Back 4. Thofe of the Throat.
5. The Mutcles of the Shoulder. 6. Thote
Of


121
of the Breaft, beginning at the Nipples,
and ending at the Small of the Belly; all
the Motions and Changes of which may be
obferved from the Life, to which I refer the
Praltitioner; but before he artempts this,
he will do well to draw firft after anaromical
Figures, many of which are extant in Cop-
per-place Prints, and then after such as are
call in Plaifter of Paris by which Mcans
and the reading of anatomical Lectures upon
the Mutcles, he foon will form a right
judgment and Idea in drawing his Figuies
to Perfection,
and in their regular Poltures
and Motions.

ATURE, or the Life, is compleat in
& all Things, and to umitate the meanett
Proluction of Nature, r. quires a matterly
Hand. This may invire us to chufe her
for our Partern and chief Object to draw
affer. This cannor be better purin Execu-
tion, than for to chufe a Company of inge-
nious young Men, with whom a young
Beginner jomtly may spend one or two
Days in 2 Week, under the infiruction of
an able Mafter, to draw after Life; that 1s
to fay, after a naked, flrong, and robuft
Man, of broad Shoulders, a fair Breaft,
very well mufcled, thick Thighs, long
Legs, and of a proportionable Sizz. And
having put this your Model in the Polture
6
you


22
you have agreed on, and furnished the
Rcom with a proper Light, fuch as has
been defcribed under the afth Article, you
proceed to copying, every one to his beft
Skill, without defpiting one another's Per
formance; but rather instructing and encou
raging each other with Modefty and good
Manners.
For fanding Actions, the Perfon drawn
by, is commonly placed on the Ground;
but when fitting or lying, it will be proper
to have him placed on a Table at a conve.
ment Ileight.
VIII
T is cuftomary for Beginners as well as
able Mafters, to draw with Charcoal, ii
being the eafieft rubbed out again, in cafe
of a Fault. Others make ufe of Black-lead,
with which they draw the Outlines and after-
wards finith their Pieceseither with Crayons
or other Things they are ufed todraw with
but this is more fitter for experienc’d Mat
ters than young Practitioners.
The feveral Ways made ufe of in finifh-
ing a Draught, depends upon the Choice of
the Arcifts; fome ufe Red Chalk; others
Black Chalk; others draw with a Pencil,
which is called wathing, and is done with
several Sap-colours, as Indian ink, Biftre, or
Chunney Scor, of Wood Smoke, ground in-
digo, ground Red Chalk, and the like,
Others


127
others again finith their Pieces with wricing
Pens, which Way is the moft redious, and
not to be recommended, but to fuch as in
tend to pratice Graving on Copper-plates.
Some ale Pens made of Keeds, and many
Figures with them
great Mafters have drawn
in bold Strokes; some chule Charcoaldipp’d
in Linfeed Oil, but this muft be ufed quickly
and readily, and is only fit for large Things;
others make ufe of Tobacco-pipe Clay
wherewith they draw on blue or other co-
loured Paper, and heighten the Lights with
white Chalk: Of this Tobacco-pipe Clay
are allo made Crayons or Paftils of various
Colours, with their different Shades, and
they are thus done: Take Tobacco-pipe
Clay, and with a little Water temper it with
what Colour you pleafe; work it well toge
ther, roll a into Paftils, and lay them on a
clean Paper to dry. Some will put Gum or
Size in the Water; but then the Crayons
commonly prove hard and become ufelefs.
Thefe are the common Methods Practity-
oners make ufeof in finithing their Draughts;
moft of them chufe Paper, some indeed
prefer Parchment and other Things, but
white Paper has been approved of by moft
Artifts for skerching, harching, and wathing,
with all Sorts of Water-colours; Crayons
indeed are bett managed on blue or any
Other coloured Paper.

EARNERS should, in drawing after
a Draughts, follow the Manner of their
Principal, that in to doing they may be
accuftomed to it all their Life-time. If you
haick with a Pen, take Hleed to avoid
feratching; endeavour to make the Strokes
free and bold, beginning from the fine or
tharp End to the broad; tome flat and equal
Shades muft be drawn with equal Hlarches,
let them be fine of Coarle.
In drawing with Crayons hold your Paf-
tils straighe forwards, and they will not fo
foon become blunt, for turning them be-
Tween your Fingers, they will wear and yet
Keep their Point continually, fo that you
may draw a whole Draught without icrape-
ing your Paltils.
Roulling is allo pratifed by some, and
differs not much from harching; only to
make it look clofe and blended one in and-
ther, it muft be dofied with some Corton
fixed in a Goofe Quill. When in this man-
her you begin to fhadow your Draught, do
it firft fainr, finooth, and even, to asit may
appear as if wathed with a Pencil; then you
shade your Draught in the darkeft Places,
with Hatchings in a graceful and mafterly
Manner thus by harching and dofting the
one upon the other, you willaccultomyour
felf


125
felf to a mafterly Iland in Drawing. This
fort of dofling or harching is done with
eitherred or black Chalk. Inflead of Cot
ton some make ufe of a Hlair Pencil, that is
finged blunt ar a Candle.
As much as this Manner of Drawing is
admired by fome, I cannot recommend. it
for it makes the Workmanthip hard, fliff,
and occafions a Breaking in the flat Parts,
except it be in finall and curious Picces.
The Cuftom of great Mafters has been to
afe but one Thing in their Hands at once,
by which they have compleated ther
Draughts, without afing Cotton or the like.
However if one defigns to make fomerhing
curious and nice, the aforefaid manner of
dolling will not be amiss, only I would not
have the Practtioner accuftom humfelf to it
alrogether. If one draws Counterfeits,
especially upon coloured Paper, let him
(mooth the Edges of the Heightenings with
the like coloured Paper rolld up to a sharp
Pointat one End; with this joumay fweeten
or foften the Edges, to as to appear nether
t00 hard nor sharp.
There is a fingular Manner Come Artifts
ufe of Wallung, performed with a Pencil
dipt in Ink, or any other Sap-colour, and
to pencild on all Sorts of either white or
coloured Paper, they wath therewith in any
Draught the principal Shades, and afterwards
work over them flightly, with a Pen or
black Chalk. This is a geol mafterly Man
G3
Rers


126
er, and looks exceedingly well. in wathing
you muft obferve to lay on firft, the fofe
and faint Shades, finoothing the Edges with
a clean Pencil, moiftened a little with your
Tongue; when this is dry, go over the
darker Shades with a deeper Colour thus
you proceed with a third and fourth Shade,
till you fee your Draught perfect, always
taking fieed not to make your Work too
hard ar firft; the faint Shades, especially on
colcured Paper, mult be imperceptibly lolt,
fince the Heightening with Whice will help
7Ch.
X

HERE are two Proferties neceltary to
be underffood in the Art of Drawing,
the one is general, the other particular: All
7
Things composed confift of certain Parts,
which together carry on a Correfpondence:
They make a general Mass or Lump, and
are by our Sight diftinguished either in
general or particular. If then you draw
either after a Print, Picture, or Life, ob-
ferve the general Form reprefented to you,
which confifts of feveral Parts, examine
whether it be round, (quare, trangular,
long or thort; and this is bett obfervable
with an half thur Eye, without oblerving
the Parts as are contained in the General.
For Example, Suppofe a Head complearly
finithed, the circumferent Strokes confii-
TTES


127
tutes the general Mals; the Eyes, Nofe,
Mouth, Coc. are the Particulars contained
in the General; the Queftion is, whether
this Face may be known by the Paris in
Particular, or all the Parts in the circumfe-
Tent Strokes
I shall anfwer this with the following
Examples: Suppofe two Paces be drawn
with fomething that may be eafily wip’d off,
very like each other; wipe the circuimferent
Stroke of one Face clean away, fo that no-
thing remain but the finall Parts, as the
Eyes, Nofe, Mouth, C8c. and you will pre-
fently find, that the Likenels of the Face is
gone, or if about thofe particular Partsyon
draw another circumferent Line, differing
from the former, you will behold another
Likenets in the Face, much differing from

5
what it had before By this it appears
plainly that the Parts themfelves, do not
reprefent themfelves in their Being, before
they are jomed to their general Our-ftrokes.
Asthefe particular Parts are obferved in the
general of the Hlead, the same is to be taken
Nonce of in the Arms, Hands, Legs, and
Feet; for although, in respect to the whole
Body, they are but Parts, yet in themfelves
they are general to the Parts they contain.
As the Arm has its Mutcles, the Bending of
the Elbow. The Hands have their Fingers,
and Fingers again their Members, and fo
on. In the Jame Manner is the Knowledge
of Things bidden in the Generalicy of all,
C. 4
for


128
forlet a Man whom we know very well be
at Tome reafonable Diftance, fo that we can
not know him by some fmall Parts, as by
his Eyes, whether brown or gray, nether
his great or fnall Nofe, his red of pale Face,
nor any other fnall Part of his Body, not
withflanding we shall knowthis Man at this
Diftance By what Means? By mmeans of
the General, for the general Lump feen
by you, even when his Eack is turned upon
yeu, will make you prefently know hum.
EI.
Now come to fay fomeching concerning
& the Nature and Virtue of Lights and
Shades: There are no Things in Nature
which can be diftinguished by us, in a leffer
or further Diftance from us; nor can it be
without
exprefted by the Art of Drawing,
this Knowledge, for without Dark and
Light, nothing refembles what it ought to
do, for it is that, which gives a Being and Re
prefentation to all Things. To prove this,
draw a Counterfeit upon a white Paper,
with black Chalk, when finithed it is like
the Perfon, and judged to be well drawn;
here it may be asked, Whar Correfpondence
has black Chalk, wherewith you made your
Shades, and the white Paper, by which the
Light is reprefented with the Original, that
is Lifer To which lantver, It is not the
black



129
black Chalk, nor the whice Paper, nor any
fingle Strokes drawn, but it is the Effect of
the Lights and Shades in their proper Places,
that reprefent Life itfelf to us, for it is im
poffible, that either a round Circle or Spot,
of a flat Colour, should reprefent a Globe,
except the Roundness, is given it by Light
and Shadow.
XII.
T OUNG Pratitioners or Learners,
should by all Means ufe themfelves
to the beft Manner of Drawing; that 1s, to
finith their Work, plain, finooch, near, and
eaty, to blend the Shades and Lights, to as
to be loft the one in the other. This they
mult endeavour by indefaigable Pains, and
although in the Beginning it will feem dif-
ficul, and their Performance difpleating; yet
let not this difcourage them from purfuing
their Aun, for none are born Mafters, and he
that never did do ill, cannot expect ever to
do well; one Day brings on another, and
with it fome Amendment, till you arrive to
Perfection, which will be a Reward for all
the Labour and Pains, you have taken
in the Acquifition of this charming Art.

contained in a Draught or Picture, to come
forward, or fink backward, and caufes them
from the firft to the laft, to fland in their
due and proper Places; as allo the Vacuum
or Emplinels between Body and Body, to
go from you, or come forward naturally to
the Eye, as though it were acceffible. And
as a real Perspective shews the Diltance
which every Arch or Pillar has, the one
after the other, as allo the flanding of Peo-
ple in their proper and fingular Places, fo
likewife in a Draught or Picture, by the
Diminution of Light and Dark, the Diftance
mult be obferved agreeable to the appro-
priated Declination; and every Draught or
Picture, whether after Narure or Plaifter of
Paris, you mull well obferve what appeareth
forwards or backwards and how one
Thing follows another. This is one of the
moft difficult Siudies belonging to the Art
of Drawing and Painting, wherefore a
Practitioner ought to inform humfelf in
Time, either by the Inttruction of a Maf-
ter, or by reading of Books of Perspec-
TIVe.

TAVING gone through the principal
2 Properties belonging to the Art of
Drawing, it will now be requifite to fum
up what has been faid, for making your
Work compleat and perfect.
1. In your rough Skeich obferve to bring
in a good Spirit, free and pleating to the
firtl View.
2. Corred the firft rough Draught in
the drawing it over again, and accultom
yourfelf in reprefenting the Shadows and
Touches with the Coal, in order to be cer-
tain in the Pofition of your Fisures.
3. Hlaving compleated your Delign as far
25 relatresto the ufe of Charcoal, then draw
with either your Pen or Pencil, with dili-
gent Care, the Out-lines, endeavouring to
keep of bring in, all the Beauties, Comeli-
nets, and Gentiliry of the Figures; taking
particular Care and Diligence to oblerve
and keep the Bendings and Motions of the
Body, and the eaty displaying of the Folds
ings of a Garment, in their Comelinels
and genteel Difpofition; for it ofcen happens
that by a small Bending, a whole Part of a
Figure is entirely spoild. This is a Fault
Youth are much addicted to, by obferving
thofe finall Bendings too much, which they
commonly make toobig, and thereby der
prive a Piece of that Beauty, which with a
G 6
Little


132
liccle Precaution they might have preferved;
and this puts me in Mind to caution young
Practnioners not to rely to much on the
Particulars, but the General, as I have
obferved already, in the Ath Article, for in
being too attentive in finifhing, and obfer-
ving the little and infignificant Parts, you
lofe that which ought to make the moft
Shew of amafterly Performance, therefore
let your chicfell Care be to obferve and
finith the General Parts to Perfection, for
the small or particular ones, may be put in
afterwards with more Eafe. This is an
Article highly necelfary for young Practiti-
oners to be instructed in; but to the Shame
of their Teachers, moft of them are kept
ignorant in this Particular. Thus some
Painters will take Abundance of Pains to
draw a Face near at Iland with all its De-
formities, if it has any, as Pits of the Small
Pox, Scars, Spots, and the like, when
otherwife, at a convenient Diftance, they
might have the General with the Particular,
in a more agreeable Appearance than it then
reprefents wfelf, and that with less Pains
and Trouble; but this is the Cafe with many
Pretenders in the Arr of Painting; that
they cannot draw a Portraiture to be any
thing like, except they bring in all the
Mlarks, Wrinkles, C9c.
When you draw withred or black Chalk,
take Hleed your Strokes be not hard, or too
Charp, especially in the light Parts, in the

ing of your Piece, the Strokes lofe and va-
with away, to that one might judge as if
you had finithed your Piece, without draw-
ing the Circumference of our Lines, for
thus it will be agreeable to Nature, where
no Stroke can be feen; this you may ob-
ferve in a Picture as well as in good Prints
Of Drawings.
It will happen that in Drawing between
Whice and Whire, and againtt the Light,
a Stroke or Out-line muft be drawn, for to
exprets the Draught, and diftinguith ir from
the Ground, especially when drawn on
white Paper; but this you should endeavour
to thun as much as poftible, and not do it
except Necefficy compel you to it, and you
have no other Means left to avord it; but
as I cannor here fpeak of all the Caufes
incident to this Cafe, I will only exemplify
one for the better Apprehention of young
Practicioners, by the two Faces in the op-
pofite Print.
The Face A as you plainly perceive, is
drawn compleat with an Out-line Stroke,
and the Face Bonly reprefents the Shadows
that are underneath the Nofe, Mouth, Esc.
The Queltion is, whether an Error is com-
mitted in the Face B, which might by the
Our-line of the Face A be amended. 1 for
my Part fay no, but on the contrary 1 ob
ferve in the Face Ba fingular Curioficy and
Beauty,


136
Beauty, where Whice againtt Whice makes
2 Termination without a circumferent
Stroke.
Apprehending well this Example, you
will improve if in your Drawings, and gam
thereby a fingular and accomplifhed Man-
Rer.
What I have faid on this Hlead, is to be
obferved with due Caution, for as a rough
Sketch only confifts in circumferent Lines
or Strokes, neverthelels Dexterity gives it a
fingular Beauty; you may by this Rule ap:
prehend how to work on coloured Paper,
where by the Heightnings, you may do
much, and fave many Strokes, you are
obliged to express on white Paper.
XV.
Now come to the finifhing Part; here

you muft not childifhly or apithly imi
late Stroke for Stroke, but obferve the In
rent of the Mafter, in his Expreftions, Dif
pofitions, Shades and Lights in his Figures.
If you draw a Face after a Picture, of
after Life, obferve the Paftions and Phi
ognomy thereof: Take Norice by what
Strokes, Touches, Turnings, Shades, or
otherwife, fuch a Face is made to look
forrowful or merry, crying of laughing,
old or young, wild or modeft, foul or
clean, homely or beautiful; and by obler-
ving this, you will not only follow the same
Strokes


13
Strokes, Touches, and Shades, as near 25
poftible, to exprets the fame Actions and
Paltions, but alfo you will retain the fame
in your Mind, and underfland it with a
well grounded Knowledge.
When you begin to finith your Draught,
take Hfeed you make not the Shades at firft
to hard or deep as they mutt be when fi-
nifhed. you may eafily bring them to be
darker, but not to to make them lighter.
Acquire a good Judgment in difpoling your
Shades, to that they may fling Things either
backwards or forwards. For wharever you
draw with, let it be Redlead, Indian Ink,
Black Chalk, Cec. Von mult exprets one
extream Dark or Light, and therefore accut-
tom yourfelf from your beginning to draw;
to fhadow very light and fweet, fame and
even, and bring in the Perspective of Dark—
nets as much as poffible, and by obferving
this, you will find yourfelf feldom deceived
but gain Honour and Applaute by your Per
formance.
Be careful to keep your Draught in one
even and equal Condition, to that it may
not appear as if compoted of dark and light
Spots; but let the Lights and Shades cor-
respond and agree together, the leffer dark
with the faime, and the faint with fronger
Lights, otherwife your Work will prefenrly
incline to hardness and ftiffnets; which, if
you examine Life, you will never meet with
there.
Whey


138
When you draw on coloured Paper,
after a Print or Draught, obferve the even
Likeness of Dark and Light, keeping the
oreat Parts of Lights and Shadows, and the
23
small intermixt Parts in the Jame Manner,
that the greater may always have the Pre-
dominancy over the lefs.
I shall conclude with advifing young
Practtioners to obferve in all their Perfor
mances a true Symetry and Proportion, of
pecially in all the Parts of a human Figure.
Ler them firff well be Mafter of every Par-
ticular, for it is the A BC, or Alphabet,
which when well learned, is cafily joined
together into Words; and he who can de-
lineare well, the Eyes, Nofe, Mouth, Ears,
E8c. will readily form a well proportioned
Face, and after he has ufed himfelf to draw
Hands, Arins, Legs, Coc. he will calily
cCinpile a whole Body.
There are indeed feveral eminent Pain.
ters, who have in their Writings endea-
voured to teach young Practitioners, the
Art of true Proportion and Symerry, by
Geomerrical and Perspective Rules, how to
form an Ovalout of a Circle, a Perpendicular
Into a Square, according as the one or
other Object is reprefenting itfelf to ones
Eyes; but as this Way of proceeding is ve
ry redious, and likely to deter joung Be-
ginners, a fertil Genius will, like many
other great Mafters, advance in his Perfor
mances by more cafier Steps, and form a
rue


139
wue Ided in his Conception of Nature
WElf.
In relation to the true Symetry of the
Human Body, it is to be admired, that
from the Dunenfion of a Toe or Finger,
the whole corporeal Subltance may be de-
monftrated; to that three Sculpiors in three
different Places, having agreed on the true
Meature of the Heighr, may work on one
Statue, and when the Limbs are brought
and fixed together, will make a perfed
lmage according to Art.
A Man that is well proportioned is eight
Jumes as high as his Head, that is, from the
Hair of his Forehead to his Chin; his Face
is three Nofes long, and his Foot is one
Fifth of his Length.
II would feem incredible to some People,
did their own Experience not convince and
latisty their Curiofity, without any Coll or
Charge, that a Thread which reaches three
tames about the End of the middle Finger,
should be juft to long as totake in the Com-
pats of ones Wrift; and that fix tinies of
that Length, is the Meafure about ones
Walte, over the Navel this may be eafily
tried by winding a Thread fix Times about
the Writt, and then meafuring the Walte.
A Thread which goes round ones Fere-
head, will allo reach from the Chin behind
the Neck; and it is remarkable, that by ex-
tending ones Ilands and Arms as far as one
can, the two Ends of the middle Fingers
will


140
will determine ones Height, and a Man
placed in thar Pofture, will defcribe a Oua-
drant, whole Centre is the Privy Paris.
Alfo if a Man extends his Ilands and
Feet, in the Figure of a St. Andrew’s Cross,
and fixes one End of the Compals to the
Navel, and the other to the extream Parts, ir
will take the urmoll Parts of the Ilands and 
Feet in the fame Circle. The Length of
the Face and ones Hland are equal; as are
the Height of the Forehead, the Length of
the Nofe, the Ears, the Thumb, and the
Space from under the Nofe to the Chin
II is obfervable, thar all that is doubled,
is in true Order on each Side, and all that
is fingle in the Middle of the Body. If a,
Man refts on one Leg, a Plumb Line mult,
fall from over his Forehead, Nofe and
Navel, to his Feec if he firs, he makesf
with his Knees and Back a direct Angle.
Here 1 cannot omit a Queltion, viz.
Whar were the proportionable Joints and)
Features of the great Coloffus at Rbodes the
whole Height whereof was 120 Foor?
It does appear by this Hleight char the
Trunk was 20 Foot wide, the Face 12f
Foot long, and his Nofe and Thumbs each
4 Footlong. From such like Observations

we may inform ourfelves of many Thingsf
in Antiquity, by comparing and calculating

the Dimentions of one Part to the other,
and thus find out the true Proportion.

The Usefulness and Use of
PRIN T S.
GHIAT which I now am about to
treat upon is concerning Prints,
the Invention whereof is allow’d,
by all Lovers of Artand Inge—
nuity, to be one of the happieft
Productions of later Ages.
Prints are in our Age arriv’d to to high
a Degree of Perfection, and good Gravers
have given us to many on all forts of Mar
ters, that it may truly be faid, they are the
Depofitories of all that is fine and curious
in the World.
Their Origin was in the Vear 1460, and
arofe from one Maso Finiguerra, a Gold-
finith of Florence, who grav’d his Place,
when cafting some off in melied Sulphur,
he perceiv’d that what came out of the
Mould was mark’d with the fame Prints as
his Place, by the Black which the Sulphur
had taken from his Graving: Hle rry dro do
as much on Silver Plates with wer Paper,
by rouling it finvothly with a Rouler, which
alto succeeded.
This Novelty tempted Baccio Baldim, a
Goldfinich of the same City, to try whether
he


142
he could do the fame, and his Success of
calion’d him to engrave feveral Plates of
Sandro Boticello's Invention and Delign, and
upon this Andrew Maniegna, who was at
Rome at that ime, fet about engraving fome
of his Own Pieces.
The Knowledge of this Invention geting
Into Flanders, Martin of Antwerp, then a
Janious Painter, engrav’d Abundance of
Plares of his own Invention, and fent fe
veral Prints into Italy, which were markd
thus, M. C. Vasari in the Life of Marce,
Antonio, a Painter, gives an Account of the
greatell part of his Subjects, of which there
was one amongtt the reft, (the Vition of Stl
Antony) that pleasd Michal Angelo, ther:
very young, to well, for the Invention of
it, that he colour’d it. Affer Martin of
Antwerp, Albert Durer began to appears
and gave the World an infinice Number of
fine Prints, as well in Wood as in Copper,)
all which he fent to Venice to be fold.
Marco Anlome, who happen’d ac thaif
time to be there, was fo rarith’d with the
Beauty of thefe Prints, that he copy’d Sixp
and Thirey of them, which reprefenced ourt
Saviour's Paffion, and thefe Copies weref
receiv’d ar Rome with to much the more
Admiration, by how much the more the
were finer than the Originals. At the famef
fune Hage du Carpi, an Italian Painter of if
incan Capacity, but of a Wit apt for Inven
tion, found our by means of feveral Plaresf
01


143)
of Wood, the way how to make Prints re-
temble Deligns of Claro Ofcure, and fome
Years after the Invention of Etching was
dicover’d, which Parmegiane foon made ufe
Of.
Thefe firft Prints drew the Admiration
of all that faw them for their Novelty, and
the skilful Painters who work’d for Glory
3
were willing to ufe them to fpread their
Works over the World. Raphael, among
others, employ’d the famons Marco Antomo
to engrave feveral of his Pittures and De-
signs, and thofe admirable Prints were to
renown’d, that they carry’d the Name of
Rapbael through the:World. A valt num-
ber of Gravers have made themfelves famous,
fince Marco Antonio, in Germany, Ialy,
France, and the Low Countries, and have
publiffrd as well by Graving as Eiching, an
infinice number of Prints on all forts of Sub-
jeds, as well Hiftories, Fables, Embleims,
Devifes, Medals, Annnals, Landskips, Flow-
ers, Fruns, as in general all the vifible
Productions of Art and Nature.
There is no body, of what Condition
or Profeffion foever, but may profit very
much by inspecting into Prints. Divines,
Philofophers, Soldiers, Travellers, Geo.
graphers, Painters, Sculptors, Archireds,
Gravers, Lovers of the Fine Arts, all that
are curious in Hiffory or Antiquity, and in
thort, all who having no particular Profef
fion,


244)
fion; Men of Honour and Fortune, can
adorn their Minds with the Knowledge of
those Things, that may render them the
more worthy of Elleem.
It is not pretended that Perfons are ob-
lig’d to fee all the Prints that have been pub-
lith’d, to know how to profit by them; the
infinice Number of them prefenting at once
to many different Ideas to a Mans View,
will rather confound than inform him:
Thole only, who are born with a great and
a clear Genins, who have been us'd, for
sometime, to the Sight of to many different
Things, canmake them profitable to them,
and fee them all without Confufion.
Every particular Man may chule thofe
Subjects that are moft proper for him, that
may either refreth his Memory or frengthen
his Judgment, in which he should be di
rected by the Inclination he has for Things
of his own Golt and Prefetfion.
As for Example, nothing is more fuita-
ble to Divines than Prints which relare to
the Sacred Hiftory of the Oid and New
Teftament, and every thing which difcovers
the Exercife, or the Perfecution of the pri-
nitwe Chriftians: The Antique Basso Re-
levo's, which in ma:y Places inform us of
the Ceremony of the Heathen Werfhip: In
thort, any thing that has relation to our
own, whether it be Sacred or Profane.
For


245)
For Philofophers: All the Demonftrative
Figures, which relate not only to the Ex-
periments of Phyfick, but all that may en-
creafe their Knowledge in natural Tings.
For thofe that are bred up to War: The
Plan and Elevation of fority’d Cities, the
order of Bartles, and Books of Fortification,
of which the demonttranve Figures are the
greatelt Part.
For Travellers: The particular Views of
Palaces, of Cities, and confiderable Places,
to prepare them for the Things they are to
fee, or to preferve the Ideas of thofe they
have feen.
For Geographers The Maps and Plans
necelfary in their Profeffion.
For Painters: Every Thing that may
Rrengthen them in their Art, as the Antique
Pieces, and thofe of Raphael and Caracci
for the good Gont, Cerrectness of Defign,
the Dignity of Manner for the choice of the
Hairs of the Head, the Paffions of the
Mind, and the Attitudes. Thole of Correg-
gio for Grace and Delicacy of the Expres-
sions; thole of Tihian, Bafan, and the Lom-
bards for the Character of Truth, for the
fimple Exprestions of Nature, and above all,
for the Golt of Landskips. Thole of Ry-
bens, for the Grandeur and Magnificence
of his Invention, and the rtifice of Claro
Ofro. In thort thote that, tho' they may
II
be


146
be defective in some particular part of them,
may yet have fomerhing in them fingular
and extraordinary, for the Painters may
draw a confiderable Advantage from all the
different Manners of thofe that have gone
before them, who are, as to many Flowers,
from whence, like the Bees, they may fuck
a Juice, which incorporaring with their
proper Subltance, will bring forth such
Works as are ufelul and agreeable.
For Sculptors. Statures, Basso Relievos,
Medals, and other Anrique Works, those of
Raphael, Polidoro, and the whole Roman
School.
For Archifetts. The Books that concern
their Profeffion, and tharars full of demon
ftranve Figures of the Invention of their
Ruchors, or copy’d from the Hnliqte.
For Gravers. A Collection of Pieces of
different Manners, as well graved as eichd.!
This Collection should alfo ferve to thew
them the Progress of Graving, from Albert
Durer to the Gravers of our own Tines,
which will include the Works of Marcof
Antonio, Cornelius Cort, the Caracer, Sade-
lers, Pontias, Belfvert, Goltius, Maler, Vof-
terman, Vifcher, and a great many more

thar I have not named, who had a particular
Character, and who by different Ways,
Rrove all of them to imitate either Nature,
when they did fomething of their own in
VentioR, or Pictures of different Manners,
when


347
when they only aimed at the Farchfulnels
In comparing thus the
of Imitation.
Works of all thefe Mafters, they may judge
which of them underffood beft the Manage-
ment of their Tools, of Light, and the
ulefulnels of Harmony, as it relates to Claro
Ofnro: which of them in their Operations
reconciled Delicacy and Force belt, and in
their Productions were moft fentible and
exact, that making a good fe of thefe
Lights, they may have the laudable Ambr
tion to equal or furpats thefe skilful Mafters.
For the Curicus in Hiffory and Anriqui-
7. Every Thing that has bien engraven
belonging to facred or profane Iiftory, the
Fable, antique Baso Relieves, the Trajun
and Antonine Pillars, the Books of Medals
and Stones engraved, and feveral Prints
that may help them in the Knowledge of
thofe Things they would know, or to keep
thofe they know already in their Memory.
In short, for thole that to be more happy,
and more Gentleman-like, would form their
Golt by the Sindy of good Things, and
have a realonable Tincture of the fine Arts,
othing is more neceffary than good Prints.
Their Sight, with a little Reffection, will
readily and agreeably inform them of every
Thing that may exercife their Reafon, and
Rrengthen their Judgment. They may fill
their Memory with the moft curious Things
of all Times, and all Countries, and in
learning the different Hiftories, learn the
I2
Leve


-


148
feveral Manhers of Painting: They will
judge readily, by the Pacilicy with which
they may open a few Leaves, and to com
pare the Productions of one Mafter with
thofe of another, and by this means, in pa-
ring their Time, they will spare their Ex
pence alfo; for it is almoft impoffible to put
the Pictures of as many Mafterstogether in
2 Room, as will fuffice to form a perfect
Idea of the Work of each Mafter, and
when at a vall Charge, a Man has filled 2
large Chamber with Pictures of different
Manners, he cannoe have doove two or
three of eacl, which is not enough to en:-
hle him to make a nice Judgment of the

Character of the Painter, or the Extent of
his Capacity; whereas by means of Prints,
one may eafily fee the Works of feveral
Mafterson a Table, one may form an Idea
of them, judge by comparing them one
with another, know which to chule, and by
practifing it offen, contract a Habit of a
good Taffe, and a good Manner, especially
it we do it in the Company of any body,
that has Difcernment in thefe Things, and
can dillinguith what is good, from what is
but indifferent.
Such as have any Paffion for the fine Arts
take a regular Method in their Collections;
they do it by the Painters and their Difci
ples. In the Reman School they place
Raphael, Michael Angelo, their Difciples,
and their Contemporaries. In that of
Venite


149
Venibe, Giorgione, Titian, the Baffanm, Paole
Veronese, Tintoret, and other Venetians. In
that of Parma, Corregio, Parmegiano, and
thofe char followed their Gont. In that of
Bologna, the Carracci, Guide Diminichine,
Albani, Lanfrance and Guerchino. In that
of Germany, Albert Durer, Holben, the lic
tle Mafters, William Baur, and others. In
that of Planders, Othe Venins, Rubens,
Vandike, and thofe that practited their
Rules. In the same Manner they put the
Mafters of the French School, and thofe of
other Countries in their feveral Claffes.
Others collect their Prints by the Gravers,
without Respect to the Painters: Others, by
other Fathions, and indeed it is reafonable
that every one should have Liberty to do in
this what feems to him to be ufeful and
agreeable.
Tho' one may at any Time, and in any
Age, benefit ones felf by the Sight of Prints,
yet Youth is more proper for it, than any
Other Part of Man's Life, becaufe Memory
is the Gift of Childhood, and while Perions
are young, they ought to make Ufe of it as a
Magazine, to lay up Things, that may
contribute towards forming their Judg-
Melit.
If the Ancients had had the fame Advan-
tage in this as we have, and if they had,
by means of the Prints, tranfimicted what
they had done, that was fine and curious,
to Pofterny, we should have diftindly
Known


150
Known Abundance of Things, of which we
have but confuled Ideas in Hiftory; we
should fee the ftately Monuments of Mem-
pbis and Babylon, and the Temple of Teru-
falem which Solomon built with fo much
Magnificence; we should make a Judgment
of the Building of Atbens, Cormib, and
old Rome, with more Grounds and with
more Certainty than we now can by the
poor Remains that are left of them. Pay
Jamas, whe has made fuch an exact De-
scription of Greece, would have accompa-
ied his Difcourfes with demonftrative
Figures, which might have been handed
down to us, and we might have feen wich
Pleature, not only the Temoles and Pala
Ces, as they were in their Perfection, but
we should alfo have inherred from the anci-
en Workmen the Art of good building.
3
11s for want of thefe Means thar the Mla-
chines of Archimedes and the elder Iliero are
loft, and the Knowledge of Diosorides's
Plants, as alfo, of feveral Anmals, and of
a great many of the curious Productions
of Nature, which the Studies and Medita
tions of the Ancrents difcovered: Bur not to
treuble ourfelves any longer in grieving for
the Loss of Things which we cant recover,
let us profit ourfelvesby thofe Prints that we
have amongtt us.
