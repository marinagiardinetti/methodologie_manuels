Holland having juftly recommended him to the Esteem of
28 A.
the most knowing there, I thought it very proper to make
him speak Englith; and the ratker, (to uje his own Rea-
son) for that, the many excellent Authers hove writtin
T
on Painting, yet, in Bulk, they seem rather to cry up the
Art and Artiff than lay down solid Rules for Attainment: To which I.
may add, that those Authers are moftly useless to an Englifuman, and
few, or none, copious enough to answer general Purpole; nor at beft are
of absolute Service in England, where fresh and fair Natureis preferr’d
before the brown and warm Colouring of some other Countries, especially
italy, where the beft Books have been written on the Subject: But princi-
pally, for that I think, nothing has been publissed here so learned, full
and compleat, and so well explained by Plates and Examples, as tbe
Auther will be found to be; ner perhaps, wherein Portraiture (a Branch

which England mightily affects) is so copioufly bandled.
The Author learned the Rudiments of his Art under his Father; and
at Amkterdam (whither be came Toung from Lurtich, the Capital of
a Bishoprick of that Name in Germany) where be settled; lived and.
died, gave early Proofs of the Skill and Eradition for which be was
afterwards famed : Accordingly, be pursued Hiltory and irs chiof Or:
nament Emblematic Learning; and, having made some Proficienty in
thefe two capital Branches, he conceived, that otber things must be eafy
of courte, as being but Rivalets flowing from those main Springs:
Wherefore, tis probable, by what he writes, that, in their Tuins, pe
prattifed Pertraiture and the otber Parts in such manner as to quali
4
him to criticife on all of them.

THe TEANSLATORS PREFACE
Rut bis Tbirff for the Arts sopp’d not bere: He was perfuaded, tbat
so inquifitive, so laberious a Genixs as bis, was as proper for a Plate as=:
the Pencil, and therefore, at Times, be etch’d a great Number of Prints
from his own Defigns, which have met with good Reception Abroad, ef-
pecially in Germanr, where a Set of them have been copied to geod Ad.
Tutuge.
As his Praitice was as useful, laberious and univerfal as that of
any Painter of the Age, so alfo was the Theery whereon be built it. It
dees nit affear, that he ever vifited France or ltaly, or any other Acade-
my: Neverfbeless, Rome, France, England and Germany know him in
his Werks; and at Home be made himself Maffer of such a Fund of Claffic,
Embleratic, Iiferical and Discriptionary Learning, Prints and Books
en Painting, freeifecture, Antiquities and other Requifites, and was so
will acquainted with the Works of the bet Mafters, that he became a
gotd Critic. By this Means and thro' his great Induftry, his Ourline ap-
pears irue and easy, his Colouring warm, foft and expreffive, and his Com-
potitions nable, Earned and jup.
Amid,? tis Fatigues, be preferved the pleafunt Humour which reigns in
feveral Parts of this Work; particularly, in the odd Desription of the
Flood, Book II. Chap. X. and the Conteff between Anuque and Modo,
Book iIl. Chap. V.
 Bat what render’d him mot dear to the dge be lived in, was his: kind
and futherly ixpraction and Encouragement af joung Artiffs, and his com-
aunicairve Advics to Painters in general, (who made him frequent Vi-
6is) which they acknowledged, in often causing him the Umpire of their
Diffates on Art, eteeming his Decisions as Oracles.
: This publick Spirit, this Lice for his Art, as they were aluays con-
fricuous in him axthent Mercenariness, to they remained with him to the
lat: For, not with landing his Loss of Sight, (the Effect of too close an
Application to Etching by Candieligat, as many imagine, and as be him-
Ilj almot acknowkidges) he, as Monj. Gericke, Recfer and Proseffor in
the Rojal cademy of Arts at Berhn, and Painter to the King of
Prosha, obferves in the Preface to his Verson of the futhor's, Drawing:
book, made weekly, (a Thing not to be parallel’d in any other
Mafter) the Genter of a Circle, contifting of young Students, whom he
inftruted in Drawing (by which he got a Mlaincenance) and like the
Son difpented his Beams to all around him.
Under his great Affiction, the Painters, his Cotempararies, knowing be
bdffored a large Collellion of Remarks on the Art, for his private
antement, almol generally intreated him to reduce them to some Or-
der






or mo
11



to the KE ADE R.
14i
der for public Betrefc; which, not withffanding his Less of Sigbt. and
Age, tbey thought him still capable of deing.
His Inability for Painting, an Amusement to his Chagrin, his Friends
Requefts and a Defign to be thereughly informing to promising Tjres;
fvay’d him to a Compliance; and how well the Werk was received may up
pear from the commendatory Copies of Verfes penn’d by the beft Peets of
that Time, and prefix’d to each of his thirteen Books; which I have
omitted in the Translation, as being of no Significancy to an Englith
Reader.
The aforefaid Remarks and Observations were originally in French; and
in compiting, the Auther made several Additions to them, even while the
Sbeets were printing off; which may possibly make the Work seem, in some
Places, less smooth than otherwife it would be, the certainly the better for
them; judging with Piato:
Non chim txdet bis dicere quod bene dicitur.
He tells us, that if Connexion in general be not so well observed as might be
wished, it was occason’d by his doing the Work prece-meal, and taking Things
as they arese: And that, if he be thought to speak too freely and censure otber
Nens Works too rably, it should be considered, that, as a Man, he has bis.
Failings in common with others Nevertheless, if his Reasons be impar-
tially examin’d, be questions not an Acquittal: For, says be, if any Works.
be read without Love and impartialiry, the Labour of Inftruction is
loft; wherefore, he, who would reach Fundamentally and Well, mult
avoid Prepoffestion, wergh duely what feems odd to him, and inquire
and reafon throughly before he fix either his Thoughts or Opinion of
Things. He also says, that if he be any where found to preseribe Rules
which he has not aleays followed, tis oxing to his dark Condition; where
in his Memory and Ideas became more rigerous, bright and intent; and coh-
sequently his judgment more sirong, acure and refined; by continual Re-
fections on the Art, than wben he had his Sight and was bussed in his.
Imployment. For further Satisfaction in this Point, see Chav. Vilts of

 st 27 t

the Book of Colouring.
K now remains to be obferved, that as his chief Talept lay n Pifiety,
the nobleff Branch of Paiating, and allowing the greateft Freedoms; to the
Heat of his Zeal, and the many Inconveniencies attending Portrainure,
might possibly indace him to spedk a little too. Ireely of the latter; in Dook
VII. However, I hope, he will be excused, since he notwithstanding fails:
not afterwards to be very particular in his Infiructions on that Head. And.

the frk Perfon in the Trinity, give any Offence, I enly observe, that, the
bis Reasons are plausible, yet be modeftly concludes, that herein a Painter
muft be very difcreet, and not abute the Liberry allowed him by Scrip-
ture, and the Confent of the Fathers, Coc. Wherefore, since such Thing;
are not allowable by Proteltants, (of whose Communion the Auther profef=
fes to be) Ino farther maintain the Point than to say, I could not, in Tuffice
to the Wark, leave eat the Chapter whichtreats of it.
Bat a grintigal Satisfaction I think necessary to be given, touching the
verbal or delcriptionary Tables, occurring in several Parts of the Work.
Teefe, tho or fir i View they may pesfibly seem dull and tiresome, yet, when
daely confidered, will appear to be Mafer-pieces in their Kind, and not
only di play the uther's solid Learning, but aijo his great Induftry in in-
forcing his Precegts by every Methel. For, as it is evident that he bas
spared for no Pains, beth by Difcourfes and Examples, to evince the Dec-
trine of Dilpolition, Morion, Paltions, Contraft, Colouring, Harmony,
Light and Shade, Reffexions, Draperies, Grounds, Ornaments, and
generally every Thing which can contliture a good Compofition; so
1
cunnot but objeree, how wenderfully be reduces all those Parts to Pratticein
the said Tables, and thereby illugrates divers Things and effential Circum
Rances, which coull not be so well done either by Discourfes or in any other
Manner. In a Word: Theyare Summaries of the Whole, and the beft Instructi-
ons for Performance, and to inferm the Judgment of a Lover of Painting,
and therefore the Work would have been incompleat without them. It is cer-
tain, that by such Precepts as the Auther lays down, the greateft Mafters in
Hiftory bove mude themselves famous; and by thefe, even Face-painters
have artained tbe Leofeness and Freedom, I may jay, the hiftorical Ma-
nagement we difcover in their beft Pieces. But the uther stops not here:
For be sails not every where to inculcate emblematic and hieroglyphic
Learning; a Part of Knowledge which, though much overlook’d, is very
belpful and necesfary in almoft every Branch of Painting.
On the Whole, as his great Reading appears by the Number of Au-
tbers be quates on this Occasson, and as be endeavours to be generally useful,
even to the Handling of Architelture, Statuary, Engraving, Etching,
and Mc2rotinto; so it is hoped, the Werk will prove here, as it bas
done abread, A Srftem of the Art of PAINTINC. And I may poffibly,
in due Season, alfo publish the Drawing book of the same Auther 4
Work as entertaining as profitable to Lovers and Artiffis.

BE HOEVER will Rudy Ares and Sciences, mutt: expect

some, let us duely ponder where the Obfiruction lies, and
whether a Mafter cannot help us over it: Surely, if we be not too full
of ourfelves, we may meet with fuch an. Aid; according to Cato.

Since the Refusal is a greater Fault.
Experience has taught me, that ee mult feek the Sciences, not they

beaten, the more plentiful the Fruit: Bur Men mull not polipone
Things to the Decline of their Lives, in Expectation that the Fruit will

asked, to it would be worle in you to refule it when offered; if you
think, that for this Reafon you are under an Obligation to inttrult others,
- Do as you would be done by.
He, who finds the true Friend in the good Mafter, ought to think
him an invaluable Treafure; fuch an one should have Returns in the
higheff Marks of Gracitude, which the leaft Unthankfulness mult not

Years the Mind exerts its greateft Vigour and Perfeverance, and lets
nothing elcape unheeded. She tits on a square black Piece of Marble;
becaute that Colour is unchangeable and naturally artillant to the others:
And the Geometric and Optical Diagrams on it, point our her Building
on the infaliable Mathematies. Her Hair is Chesnat, becaute that Co-
lour is the moff laffing, and beft befits thefe Years: Her Head attire is
a golden Diadem, alluding to Vellow, one of the three capital Colours.
Her Breaft-ornament and Cownarered and biue, fignifying the two other
capital Colours, which by their fweet Mixture, and Exprestion of Light
and Shade by the Girdle, charm and entertain the Eyc.
Accomplith’d Natare, with her naked Secrers, is the Object of her
Imitation, by confulting Tbeery; who, naked, is partly girt with a
blue Sears, as thewing, by her concinual Contemplation, that the pat-
feffes fomething Divine, and a perfelt Knowledge of all Things vifible.
She flands to the right of Painting, and, lifting up her Locks, inspires
her with fuch exalied Thoughts as bring the Art to Perfection, and fir
it for great Things: Prompting her furcher, with the right hand Figure
on the Picture, to go to the Depth of the Sciences. The Pair of Cam-
paffes on her Head thew her continual Round of Thoughts, in con-

Light, by which the Ancieats expressd Divinity. His purple Garment lined
wirh geld Stuf, and powdered with Stars, fignifies the heavenly Inluen-
ces, contantly keeping their due Courfe and Order. The Eagle by his

Side rells us, that as is Tugiter's Bird, and foars highelt, and bears
Thurder-bolls
tris on a Cloud, and her Arm on the Rainbow (the various Colours
thereof reslect on Pxaring's Pallet) recommends to her a careful and
artfal Tempering and Cfe of the various, yer gradually uniting Colouss.
Her wiste Girmint, and Fise Head-Lross thew, that the ought to execute
neatly her heavenly Conceptions.
Anteros, handing to the left of the Apartment, and lifring up a dark
Cartain, with a Palm-branch at his Feet, denotes, as Brother to Cupid,
Love for the Art. The Poets feign of this Palm-branch, that he, being
long at Variance with his Brother, ar laft got it out of his Hands. Ihis
opening the dark Curtain fhews, that Love for the Art dispels Dark
nets and Confulion; to that the Rays of the Light illuminating Nature
rendersher more agreeable. His Crown of Laurel, Garment and Terch
fignfy hisardent Love and Zeal for the Art; which, being arrived at
Perfection, merits an everlalting Laurel.
Hifory and Peess, fanding . Niches on each Side of the Gate, tell
us, that they are the principal ids to Painting, lupplying her with
rich Thoughts and proper Marerials for Praltice and Ornament.
The Buft of Pallas reprefents the Goddets of Wifdom, the Promo-
terof Art: And the white Marble, the Purity of her Knowledge.
The Sphing on the Pedefal thews, that as this wife Montler is feigned
to devour thofe who could not folve his Riddles; to the Art, futters
thele to die in lgnorance, who do not penetrate her Secrets.
The further Apartment is hung with dark-grey Staf, the better to
Hing off the Compolition.
The Piftures with Figures, frebitefture, Landship, Coc. are the Perfor-
mances of the Art. Their hanging in round Frames raifes our Attention,
as well for their nice Dispoficion as the Contraff they caue in the Archi-
relture; their Placing, with respelt to the Subjects, is alfo very agree-
able; and their Roundness implies moreover infiniry, and that the Names
of the Profeffors of Painting, in their respective Choices, are borne with
immortal Praifes and Honours on the Wings of loud Fame, which is. to
crown them in Affcr-ages
The Pyramid in the Offship is raifed, according to the Cullom of the
Ancients, to the eternal Memory of excellent and great Men; with this
intription—Eterna Memoria facra; — Sacred to eternal Memory.

CHAP. I. Of Handling tbe Pencil.
H E Handling the Pencil is twofold, and the two
Manners very different from each other; the one slix=
ent and smooth, the other expeditions and bold; the
former is proper for copying neat and claborace
Painting, and the latter for copying hold Compoti
tions, as big as the Life. But he, who practifes the
former Manner, has this dvantage above theig
e ther, that, being accuses
alle gncts, he can
eatily execute the bold and light Manner, in rangataerrife difficutt
to bring the Hland to neat Painting; the Reafon of which is, that: ot
being ufed to confider and imicate the Fullnets of small Objects, be
muff therefore be a Stranger to it; befides, it is more eaty to leave put
some Things which we are Mafters of, than to add others, which ye
have not fiudied, and therefore it muft be the Artiffs Care to finith pis
Work as much as poffible.
Tis ridiculous to hear the Disciples of great Maffers boat, that I.
copying great Things, they certainly obtain a great and firm Wianner,
and
A

and a fat and bold Pencil; and therefore are induced to difrelith every
thing that is neat and elaborace; but, after all they can fay, tis cer-
tain, that he who would handle beff, muff Rudy that Manner which
moff exactly exhibits the different Narures of the Objects which he is
to reprefent; for thereare no other flandlings of Advantage to a Paint-
er, than the two before mentioned
But further, to convince any one, that a great and bold Handling
contribures nothing to the Art, let us place a Piece thus painted, at a
due Dillance, and then fee whether the Penciling makes it took more

natural: 1 his Advantage it may perhaps have, it may bring in more
Money, fince to happy a Mafter can difparch double the Work of a-
nother, through the Bent of an imagination firted to the Expedition
of his Hand Each Branch has a peculiar Handling adapted to the
Narure of the Objects to be reprefented; as, the Landskip-painter, in
the Leafing of Trees; the Cartle painter, in the Exprestion of Wool and
Hair; the Ornament painter, in Foliage, Branchings, Coc. and the
Flower-painter, in thin Penciling.
Painters are allo obferved to ufe, fome, long-hair’d, others, hort-
hair’d Pencils; this thin, that fliff Colours; but, notwithttanding any
fuch Differences, all is reduceable to the two Handlings aforefaid; yer
in fuch Manner, as that neither of them ought to appear but for the
Advantage of the Arriff only, the Art being a Theory of the Mind,
and the Handling, a manual Praltice, confitting of a Penciling in an
orderly and decerminate Matter, for reprefenting an Object certainly
and quickly, and without muddling.
Many are of Opinion, that this is a Cift of Natme peculiar to some
only; and tho' I cannot incirely dilown it, yer muft fay, that it lies
more in Pratice: And tho' we fee many Painters, in the decline of
their Lires, fall into an hard and muddy Manner, yet that argues not
againtt my Polition, fince it happens either through in-lination, or Want
of better Foundation in their Vourh.
How offen do we fee Mafters known by their Disciples? Little and
flovenly Mafters never bring upneat and curious Painters, tho' it fome
times happens, that a neat Matter may rear a flovenly Dikciple. And
the Reaton is plain; for good Inftrultion is not alone fufficient, without
a doe and perfet Apprehention of it; Carelessnets being the ulual Pa-
rent of a bad Pilture; and to infelting an Evil will continue, as long
as the Artiff remains in this lgnorance.
It is certain then, in order to obtain a good Handling, that a right
and early Apprehention of Instruction, and thorough Sight of Faults,
276

Chap. 2. Of Penciling, Second Tint, and Beauty.
are ablolutely neceltary: When thefe Points are gained, the Artiff
mult endeavour at the three following effential Qualitications.
1. Boldaets of Hland, in the Dead colouring.
2. More Care, Circumspection and Labour in the second Colouring,
nd,
2. Thorough Pacience and Attention in the Re-fouching or Finithing
a Pilture; the nigher to Perfection, the more Care.
Thefe three Qualities are as effential to a Painter, as the three Graces
t0 Venus.
Our firft Work then mutt be, to lay both Lights and Shades bold;
with a broad and full coloured Pencil, one by the other, even and
without muddling; and then, gently moving the Pencil to and fro, up
and down, as the Nature of the Object requires, we thereby unite the
Colours, and fetch out the Relief: Wich this Caution neverthelets, that
the Lights mull not be fcumbled too much into the Shades, or the
Shades into the Lights. Thus the Work will have a good Effect.
By proceeding in this Manner, we shall perceive no very particular
Handling in our Work, and therefore it mult be a good one; for the
firlt Colouring is hid by the second, as that is by the third, wherein
les the Neatness.
Having hitherto fpoken chiefly of Painting in little, and its Man-
ner of Hlandling, I shall, in the next Chapter, lay down Inftructions for
Painting as big as the Life.

CHAP. II. Of Painting after the Lise.
E who paints after the Life, and finds it difficult, through
 A Years and Inability, to make a good Compolition, muft pot
undertake Things beyond his Strength; if ten Figures be toe
much, let him take hve; if thefe be two many, two or one, nay.
an half Figure; for little and good is preferable to much and bad
Again, if he have no Genins for Draveries, let him fiudy the ik-
ed, as Spagnolet, Carlet and other Mafters did; but then, like tham,
he muft labour to excel in that Branch; for a middling Arciff will
neither get Honour nor Gain.

 C



4 Of Penciling, Secmd Tint, and Beauiy. Boonrs
1. To gain a thorough Knowledge of Form or Preportisn, and tbi
Pations, that vou may not only give your Figures their potaral Moti-
ops, but that it may allo well appear what causes those Motions.
2 Express properly the Condition and Dignity of your Figures by
their Carriage; whether they be private Perfons of either Sex, great
Rich, or Deries
2. Seck the Colouring, not in Spagnolet or Carlet, but in Natarr
Eerfelf; let your Carnations be as natural as possible; the freth and fair
you muft paint fo; and the yellow or ruffet mult be of thofe Colours.
But, above all, induftrioully avoid inclining to a particular Man-
her; do not maintain that warm, glowing or brown Colouring is beft;
(2 Bat is, in his Kind, as beauriful as a Parrot) for then you will cer-
fainly err; and, fince Aen are too apt to hug their Faults, your
Care muft be, to be known by a good Manner and Handling.
Now, for our rrifts fafer Conduct, we shall lay down the following
Precepts for the right Ordonnance of a Piece.
1. Let him chiefly confider, where the Piece is to be fixed; in order
to place right the Herizon, and Point of Sight.
2 Let him contider, what Force the Light has in that Place, and
thereby, whether the Painting mult have frong Lights and broad
Sbades, as bring near a Window or, mere faint and melting Light, as
riioved fumber into the Room. This we may foon perceive in a Land
skip, of other within door Painting, and whether the Shades should
be ftrong, or not; fince it's certain, that the Objects, whether great or
tmall, have different Efects in thefe two inftances. And now, if the
Perspettive be also well managed, and the Colours laid fresh and proper,
and well bundled, by gently uniting them with large Pencils, the Piece
will be good
If this Hindling and Meling of Colours be not yet underftood, I
Hill clear the Point in the following Inftance: Take what Colours your
Objed requires, be they Red, Blew, Green, Violet, Coc. lay them
Fread and diffintt by each orber, without scumbling; then, viewing them
5
through a Prece of Lantern horn, you will perceive a perselt Union
of Corours, and that none of them he diffintt, the, in Fatt, tbey do.
This folly ifaltraces what I fay of a ffuent or fimooth Pencil: Now
Te Effed is the fame when we paint in Vernith, or tough or fac Oil;
becaute painting with ftarved Colours, on a dry Ground, can never of
fell this Smoothness

Ih painting after the Life, we ought to ule large Pencits; and tho'
to tome, this may seem an ufelets Admonition, becaute great Paincings
require

require fuch, yet I mult recommend it, becaute some ule common-fiz’d
and worn ones, which to muddle the Work, and fill ir to full of Hairs,
that it will bear fcraping. This Evil is to ftealing, that ar latt it be
comes habirual, and then the Painter neither minds or fees it himfelf.
Becaule there are two Sorts of Piltures; the one moveable, the o
ther fixed; the former hung at pleature in Halls or Rooms, the latter
for Cielings, of far above the Eye, each of them calls for a diftentt
Management. Niches in Galleries, as near the Eye, mult be ranged in
the Class of moveable Pictures, as well as Pourtraits; wherefore
they ought to be neater handled, tho' fometimes placed higher; at o
ther times lower.
If it be asked, whether an upright Piece, 4o or go Feet deep front
Floor to Cieling, ought to be imoothly handled, and finithed through-
out! I fay, No; but rather to be to painted, as high as you can reach;
less finithed in the middle, and less than that as it advances in Height;
and yet with fuch general Care, that all Parts seem to have a like Ferce
and Einissing. And tho' we find a different Condult in Ferdaan's magi
nificent Triumphal Piece in the Houfe in the Wood; neaf the Hogue,
yet that can be no Rule; becaute the Painting being large, the Eve
cannot diffinguith, whether the upper Parts be less fnished than the
under; moreover the Firures are bigger than the Life.
But here, methinks, a Difficulty may be started: Suppofe, in a Keont
where fuch a large Piece is, another were to be painted by it fmalter;
(as a fingle Figure no bigger than the Life) how shall we manage, in
order to give this latter Picture the same Force as the former? I antwer,
That Force and Warmth he in the Colouring, not in the Roughness of a
Picture; whence it is, that the small Pifture muft be handled in the same
Manner as the great one, to make them look agreeable; for heighten
ing and shading it with the fame Force, will produce the fame Eiffect:
And if not immediately by the pure Strength of Colours, yet by icum-
bling and glazing we fetch it out. But then, lay fome, it cannot
have a due Conformity with the Life; becaute, on comparing it with the
large Picture, it feems lels than the Life: I antwer, That this Objecti-
on muft not make us exceed the common Size of Narure, fince no fach
large Men, as in the great Pilture, are to be found in Natare; and
if any fuch were, their Parts would look too big, their Skins rougher.
Pores coarler, Hair more buthy and Rrong, 6oc. than we fee in Nar
ture: But the contrary may be practifed in a Cieling-piece, where the
Compolition is moftly hieroglyphic and filtitious.
I proceed now to thew more amply a good Manner or Handling.

CHRP. III. Of Dead-colouring; and how to perform it with Certainty
and Expedition.
HE moll certain and regular Way is, to begin the Pilture
from the Depth or Lointain, (especially when a Landskip is
introduced) lnce all Things muft juit and fall in with the
Lightafand Darkeff the fir, and the several Tints of the Piece be
modifed and governed by it; as indeed muft alfo the Light on the Fore-
ground, and the Force of the Figares; otherwife the Effelt will be dif-
agreeable and uncertain.
But if the main Compofition contill of Figures, or other large Ob-
jelts only, is better to begin where you intend the greateff Forct; whe
ther it be on the firft or second Diltance, and then work to the Off part
of the Picture.
Now, in order to proceed with Certainty, we muft take Care that
general Harmony of Parts be well obferved; that the Tints and Colours
be justly managed, according to the Laws of Depth and Diltance, to
that nothing appear offentive to the Eyc; and then the Work will

be in a fit Condition for second Colouring, with little Trouble.
Many Painters indeed err, in not knowing where to begin rightly,
and, only confulting what Objects they like beft, heedietly tall on them
firft: For Inftance, if it be a gold Vafe, they begin with that, and
then proceed to a blue Drapery, then a red one, toc. Others begin
with the Nudities, and to run thro' all the Nakeds in the Picture; by
which ftrange Disjunction the Work becomes mif (hapen, and the Paint-
or made more uneaty, than by an ill-primed Cloth.
But fuch Painters never think on any Means to extricate themfelves
ot of this Labyrinth: To what Purpofe is it to thew them their Er-
for ? They are fatished with what they have done; and falve all by
laying
- The Picture is but dead coloured; on Finishing it shall be o-
tberwife; what is now too light shall be brought down, and what teo
dark beigbtened — But all this while, the Work does not go for
ward; the rifing Difficulries pall the Fancy, and the Work is in a bad
Condition for second Colouring.

Decorum, we certainly render the secend Colouring the more eaty;
for then we can unbend our firfl general Thoughts, and apply them
folely to lay neatly and finith particular Parts, and to to work on the
former good Ground. But, to do this in the bell Manner, we mull, as 1
have laid, begin from the greateff Lointain, the Sky, and werk forwards
from thence: By this Means we have always a wer Ground to mell in with
the Outlines of the forward Figures, which otherwife they would not
have; befides another pleafing Advantage, that the Piece goes forward,
all Parts well supported, and a good Harmony in the whole: Whence the
Rye mult be fatisfied, and the Mind concinually spurr’d. This Manage
ment is one of the prime Qualities of 2 Painter; for what can encou=
rage him more, than an Affurance that he works on a fure Bafis, and
which he finds without feeking it: But unhappy is he, who works
diforderly; for muddling on one Thing as long as his Fancy for it lafts,
and then thoughtlefly proceeding to others, and dwelling on them in
the same Manner, he miffes the necellary, becoming Air of his Piece;
and, at laft, all appears out of joint, and difrelithing.
Having come thus far, we proceed to the Manner.
CHAP. V. Of Retouching, or Finishing. The French call it Recov-
cher; we, Revile.
O W fure a Painter is, having got thus far, let Experience and
I his own Reffection be Judges; for the Figures having their pro-
per Dillances, Strengths and Effects, and all Parts due Harmo-
ny and Keeping, nothing remains but to give the Piece the laft Force
of Light and Shade.
Todo which well, rub your Piece (or to much as you think you can
paint of it at one Time, and before the Vernith grow dry) with a good
thin Pifture-vernis, mixed with some fat white Oil; then work on
this wet Ground, by clapping your Lights on the lightef Parts, and,
by

by a ventle Scumble, unite them with the wet Ground aforefaid, ann

the Tenderncts of the Nudities and Draperies, in foch Degrce, as is
neceffary for each; then put in the Vellow, or Glow of the Reffecti-
ons. If, after all, the Lights of the Nudicies should be here and there
too frong, reduce them, by mixing a little light Oker, Vermilion,
brown Red, Lake, or Afphalcum (according as the Colour is tender or
Rrong: under the Vernith,) glazed thinty over them; then heighten
upon this with fuch a Colour as you thirk fir: Do the same by the
Draperies. Thus the Work will fucceed, and the Colours be prevent-
ed from going in, in drying
CHAP. VI. Of the secend Tint, and the Relief it occasions.
HER E are many who, whatever Pains they take, cannot be
brought to relith a Thing, in which they find to much Diffi-
culty. They, who have long practifed after Nature, are vexed
to fee the Works of other Mafters beter coloured, and more pleating
than their own: Infomnch that, with Difficulry, they re-affume their
Profeffions, and thea, eagerly hoping to do Wonders, find their old
Veration fill return.
Would thefe Menrightly fearch the Caute, their Trouble would end;
for, tho' we are narurally better pleated with great Maffers Works
than our own, becaute of our inferiority in Knowledge, yet we muff
not be therefore difcouraged; but (as I faid) fludy where the Fault lies.
Let us then make good Reffeltions on neat Piltures, in order to profit
by them; and alfo converfe with better Mafters than ourfelves.
Tis to be lamented, that thefe Men fomerimes fee fine Things in
another Mafter, but can give no Reason for it, becaufe they work ra-
ther by Accident, or Chance, than on fure Principles: As was the Cale
of a young Painter some Vears ago, who, shewing me fome of his
Pieces, faid, — This Piece I painted fix Tears age; this four, and
thot less; yet can perceive no Difference between them in Goodness:
Now, tho' the Difference was vilible, the laft Pieces appearing hetter
managed, in all Parts, than the former, yet he would not believe me;
trying, Thar, notwichilanding all his Endeavours, his Pictures were
grey and muddy, when others were clean and pleafant, and their Lights
broad:—Ilay on my Colours, tays he, fine and warm as they do, and then
expediciously scamble thew into eack other; now, pray tell me, what mus

then eccason this Foulness?— I teld him, —Certain Painters, with
whom you daily converfe, spoil you; and, as long as you follow them, all woy
Advice is to no purpose: As jor your Thoughts and Ordennances, I like
them very well, but dislike your Handling; you de not lay on your second
Tint clean enough; (by the secend Tint, I mean that which is laid on
the light Parts, cowards the Out line, by means of which, all relieved
or round Parts are forced to unite with the Ground, and to go off round.
ing) this you mult lay on clean and beautiful, in the same Colour as.
that of the Light; but it mult not be muddy, and like Sbade; for be-
ing alfo lighted by the Day, the Darknels, and its Grey, can have no
Effelt upon it; Relief, or Roandness, being nothing elle than a Light
receding, or geing of, which ought to partake more or lets of Blue,
in Proportion to the Colour of the Carnation; which, if yellowifh,
the second Tint mult be greenith; if Red, the Tint mult be Violet;
and if a Whice Colour, the Tint is a Medium between the two Co-
lours aforefaid. From all which Premifes tis ealy to apprehend, that
this second Colour is to be got and mixed with Bine; but not with a
foul Colour becaute it then lofes it's Fleshiness. — Here he asked me,
In what Manner then he should make it darker! I antwered, that, as
the Diftance of Objects caules Faintnels in Colouring, and what we
call ir makes a bluiss Interposition between us and them, to he mult
mix nothing with his Tint, but fine Blue, or Small, in Proportion to
such Diftance: This is a Colour, if I may fo fay, which gives no Co-
lour, or does it without much Alteration. This Conduct relaces not
only to Nudities, but allo to Landskips, Grounds, Stones, Draperies,
and, in fine, to every Object, having either Roundnels or Diftance.
Moreover, another Perfection, neceffary to this Tint, is, that we muft
not let it be too dark upon the Relief; becaute a broad Light looks ma-
jeflic, and fipne, when, between it and the broad Shade, a tender Diffe-
rence only appears. —He returned me Thanks, and I went off.
There are many, who know not the importance of the Things they
Rlight, and, in Comparifon with others, think them of no great Mo-
ment: As was the Cafe of another Painter, who, copying a Piece of
Poutin, obleryed nicely the Colouring, tempering even the half Shades
and tender Tints exactly on his Pallet; but, having finithed the Piece,
he, in other Pictures, fell again into his old Road: He himfelf law
very well a great Difference between this Piece and thofe others, and
was forry for it. But the Mifchief lay in not retaining the Manner
B
which



 
23 Of Penciling, second Tint, and Beanty. Book I.
which he had before imitated with to much Pains; and this occafion.
ed his Stigbtness.
We find even Painters who believe, that the second Tint mult, upon
Excremines, be quite dark, mixing in it the Colour of the Ground;
and fay, the great Mignard did so; which I intirely deny: It is true,
that once I read a fmall Trearife, written by the famous Bofe, ehti-
iled, Le Peintre Converti, or, The Converted Painter; in which, among
other Things, he precends to prove, that Mignard made his secend
Tist too dark, on the Extreminies of his Objects: But 1 fay, that it
muft not be underftood from thence, that he muddled the Tint with a
foxter Groundcolour; but rather, that, in Proportion to the Lightnets
or Darknels of the Ground, he made it either lighter or darker, with-
out uting any Red, Vellow, or Black in it, as they prerend. Moreo
ver, we know the vall Difference between a foreright Face, and afore-
Chortened one; that the one on the near Side grows larger than the o
ther; as the Faces in Plate L. plainly thew: Which, by observing or
regleding, gives the Painting either great Elegance or indecorum.
The greateff Difficulty fome Painters meet with, is, that one of
the Quanties of a good Picture lies in a broad Light; this they ima-
gine to confift in a Fiarness, reafoning thus: If it be Truth that a Pic
ture, with fuch Lighes, is beft, more round ones mult needs be worle.
A very loofe Argument certainly ! Since Narure and daily Experience
of round Objects teach us the contrary, especially when it is not Sun
Thiny Weather.
I have faid before, that the Contour or Out line ought to wwite in the
Tints of the Groand, that, going off from the more enlightened Parts,
iI say sof appear to much as the others: To illultrate which, we ex-
hibir here in Placel. aforefaid, a round Pillar A. againtt a Ground,
half light, half shade; to that the light side of the Pillar is fer off
by the Shade of the Ground, and the shade of the Pillar by the light
Side of the Ground. Now, it muft needs follow, in order to ovtain
the Relief, that the Shade of the Pillar ought to be made lighter on
the Excremity, that it may round off towards the light Ground; o
therwife it would be but a Semicircle. On the oppolice Side Tis the
tame, except that the Light does preferve itfelf, and its own Colour;
becaute the Air, which interpofes, caules the Our-lme to recede and fall
back; and in the Shade the fame, with this Difference only, that

there it is deubled by the Lighiness of the Back-ground, partaking
more of lefs of its Colour.
if this be not well apprehended, let the next Example explain it:
Place a globular Body againlt a light yellow Ground, as in the said
Plate; then, viewing it at some Diltance, you will perceive the Out-
snderly to melt into the Ground, without any
line on the haded
Hardnels This relates to the Roundaets only.
Now let us obferve, how much the Colour partakes of
If this
Ball be of a blue Colour, the Extremities will be greenith apainn the
Vellow; if the Ball be Violet, they become purplith; and if the
Ball be Vellow, as well as the Ground, they will be more yellow in
the Shade, as we have already taught in treating of the Naked: The
fuperficial Roughness or Smoochness of the Ball caufes litle Alle-
tation, except with respect to its Nearness to, or Dillance from, the
Ground.
Looking now on the light Side of this Ball, we shall find, that if
the Ball be lighter than the yellow Ground, the Colour of the Ground
cannot then have fo much Force on it; fince the fuperficial Colour of
the Ball cannot be overcome by a leffer Colour than it, and therefore
the yellow Ground cannot add to its Colour; whence it happens, that
the meer Interposstion of the Hir caules the Relief, or the Ourline to
round and go off.
Again, were the Ground darkith or black, yet the diminishing of
the Coloar, cauted by the interposition of the Air, will be nither
less nor more, but will be more or less fet off by the Ground, and feem
lets round
Arcifls err in thinking, that the balf Tint, which is laid next to the:
Excremity on the light side, and called Mezzo-fint, is the fame with
that placed between Light and Shade, under the Name of middle Tinr;
for this laft is a whole Tint, and the other but an half Tint, and not
to broad as the Mezzotint, which more than half mixes with the
Shade, and confequently is olser; altho’ some give it upon the Edge
of the light Side another Colour, more like Shade than the Colour
of the Objecl. The Mistake of which we have already thewns.
Bur when the Light is froncing (or comes directly from before);
then this Merzoint is half mixed with the middle Tint. Let me.
not here be mifunderflood; for 1 speak not of the Side light, which
Bainters generally wtc.
From

12 Of Penciling; second Tint, and Beauty. Book I.
From all which Premifes his plain, that this Tiat, though: called
Mer2OLint, of broken Tint, cannot be confidered as Shade, fince it
partakes of the Light.
Again, it happens frequently, that, in the fame Piece of Painting,

which ought to be fo, when, by means of
of Sight, we can difcover more than the Semidiameter, of their Round-
and but a Semidiameter or less, in others; as in the
Dets
two Pillars in the Plare aforefaid: For if the Point of Sight be in
the middle of the Piece, and the Light fall in it obliquely from the
right side, then the Objects on the right Side will have a broader
Shade, and thofe on the left a broader Light; as thefe two Pillars
plainly evidence.
But if now, on each Side of thefe two Pillars, were fome other
Pillars placed alike diltant from the Point of Sight, and both cut from
Top to Borrom through their Centers, parallel with the Horizon, it
is certain, that, at the proper Diftance, we thall fee, not only the in
ward Splitting, but alfo some Purt of the hindermoft Half, as in Pil.
lar A. Now obferre (as the Pillar to the left thews) that the Part
which is feen beyond the half on the light Side, rounds off fo much
the further, and confequently becomes darker than where the main
Light rounds off; on the contrary, viewing the light side of the
right hand Pillar, you fee as much less of the foremolt Diameter,
or half, as more of that on the shaded Side; wherefore the
Our-line cannot round off to far on its light side, nor the Extremi-
by be to dark, as on the other Pillar, where more than the Half is
vifible.
CHAP. VIl. Of Beasty; and the Proportions of the Members in an bu-

E A VT Y being the moft valuable Part of Painting, it muft
 therefore be the firft and chief Object of our Work; but my

Derign is not to mention all that can be faid of its Power, and In-
finence, fince daily Occurrences furhith us with fufficient Examples.
The wifel of the Ancients venerated it, as we fee in Plate, who
defines it to be, an Fuman Brightness of a fovely Nature, having Power

Neverthelels it mult be confelt, that it lies moft in an Ides cenceived
in our Senses and Judgment; whence tis impoftible to think, that it
should center in any one fincle Object: The moft we can fay then is
this, that thermas miny Beauties as different Objects. The Pro-
verb fays well,  So many Minds, so many Beatties. Paris imagin-

ciffes, on the contrary, thought no body handlomer than himfelf.
Stratonica, amongtt the Persans, was accounted the greateft Beavty,
and her Starue worthipped. The Neck and Breaft of the Arbemars
Tbeodota were fo amiable in Socrates's Eyes, that he fell in Love with
her. Many more inftances might be given; but feeing its Standard is
no where fixed, in order to know it certainly, we can only obferve,
that each Country, each Lover thinks it has the greatell. The Gre-
cians think the brown Complexion the moft agreeable; the Latins, the
fair; the Sponiords think black Hair, and the Germans, brown Hairs
the moft pleafing: This loves fall and well-fet People; that eftcems
Stendernels; this, a modet Carriage; that, a wanton one. From
all which Premifes is plain, that Beauty depends moft on Imagi-
nation.
Beauty is three fold. 1. Common. 2. Uncommon. 3. Perfell.
The Commos, depends much on the Fashion, and fatishes Common
fente.
The Uncommon, is fingled out by our Judgments from amongtt many
others. And,
The Perself is that, as we have faid, which fublifts in the lmagi-
Ration.
But we mult nevertheless fix on some Standard, or Model, for Beair
ty; which therefore we have drawn, to the bett of our Skill, our of
the many Patterns left us by the Greeks.
The Beauty of a Nudity in either Sex, confilts herein.

ed by the Poets the three Graces; affirming, that they were all to be
found in Venus Uranig.

of the Members, I shall here fubjoin the Meafure, as I took it from

And now I question not, but he, who governs his Figures by, thefe
Proportions, will find his Advantage in it; especially if he obferve
the Gracefulnels of the Statues.
For Instruction in the second Part of Beauty, the graceful Motion
of the Members, ler the Tyro confult the Figures in Plate VI. where-
:in he will find the principal Dilpolicions for beantifid Action, contifting
in raifing and finking the Shoulders and Hips, and their contraffing
Motions; as allo thofe of the letter Members in the fame Poffure;
from whence arifes not only the Grace of beautiful Figures, but allo
advantageous Shades; which give the laft Hand co. Grace.
1 This Iattruction is of to yniverfal Importance, that ic ought to be
obferved as well in dead as hring Nurre; in pailionate, as meek Men;
:taging, as quiet; forrowful, as joyful; thofe in Pains or dying, as in 2
dead Body: Nay, tis impoffible, that any parcicular Moyun or Po-
Jre ofthe Body can be good, which is not naturally expreft, and
condulted by the three following Qnalines. 1. A fine Oueline. 2. A

free Sway in the Motion. Laftly, A beautiful Colouring: For, ta co
lour a living Figure as a dead one, or the contrary; a raging 6He,
pale; a quiet one, hot; or a mourning one, in a merry Air, would be
egregious, and againtt the Truth; and all Lyes being hareful mult be
unworthy of Painting.
if I feem unintelligible in laying, that fine Aftion and Colouring ought
to be observed in a dead Body, void of both; it mult be Known, that
peak of a painted dead Body, not a natural one; becaute this latier
has neither the Power of Motion, nor Difpolition: However, when re-
quired, we mult difpole the Model for our dead Figure in such Man-
ner as looks moft beautiful; the Face in front; the Breaft fwaying
fidewars; one Hip riting; one Leg clofe, the other fiung out; one
Arm ffung this way, the other that way, and to forth: This is called
a fine ftron, and the whole, a beautiful Figure.
As for the Colouring, it mult not be like Wood or Stone, but
Resher, as we fee it in Nature.
If any object, that, becaute there are three principal Stages of Life;
Touth, middle Age, and old Age; each having its particular Attiop, Co-
louring and Proportions, is difficult to chule perfect Beauty out of a
n7 of them; 1 antwer, that all Three ought to be reprefented alike
beautiful, according to their Natures; the Toung, tender, gay and freth;
the Middle-aged, ledate and flethy; and the Aged, flow-motioned and
decayed: For, notwithflanding Age, each of the three has his com:
mendable Qualities—That is an handfome Vouth— Theres a
Mind the Gravity of that old Man—and to forth.
comely Man
But I pray confult Perrier's Statues, and carefully mind the Vouth of
Ganimedes; let Antinous, or Apollo, reprefent the lecond Stage of Life;
and the old Founus, the third; and you will thereby fee, that each of
thofe Figures is, in his Character, perfectly beautiful; to which add
their fine Colouring, agreeable to their Vears: All which confirmsimg.
Affertion, and the Figure muft be beautiful.
Altho’ now a beautiful Figure confifts in a good Proportion and PE
potition of its Parts, with relpect to Action and Paffion, yet it cannot
be said to be abfolucely perfelt till further improv’d by beautifil Lightss
for we often fee, that too faint Lights render Objects dilagreeable; anot
produce an Effect contrary to our intention; which makes us unealy,
becaute our firft Purpofes are fpoiled, and we know not the Reafor
of it. But fo it will happen, when, without minding the Effect of
our Objects, we chufe an improper Light; as a violent Paftion in x
Light, which loofes at once its Effect and Motion: Contrarily,

a tender and pleafant Object may, by teo prong and broad a Light,
and Shades 10o, Burg, be quire broken, and its Grace gone.
Hence it is of the laft Moment to confider thoroughly, before we
begin our Work, the Nature and Effects of the Subject we intend to
handle: As, whether it be the Murther of Tulius Cafer in full Se-
nate; of the Death of Cato; or the Nuptials of Stratonica with An.
fiectus; or the Reception of the Qucen of Sbebs, with her Retinue of
Ladies, by Solemon, &cc. Becaule different Pustins are to be incroduced
in those different Subjerts: in the former we mul (uppoie great Hurry
and Conttenation, Frght and Confuion, nay all is in Motion: In
the latter, nothing is feen but tender Beauty, eaty Carriage, graceful
Modelfy and Auchoriry.
And now who will not agree with me, that the two former Sub-
jeltsought to be handled with frong and sirp Lights; and the two latter
with joft and more tender ones? This Effect lies alfo in the very Na-
tures and Qualities of Lights themfelves; fome producing Strength
and Sharfnes; others, Sweetness, Softness and Pleasure: But a contra-
17 Manarement renders Things fulje and contradistory; becaute then
our two former Examples may be called a graceful Confussm, and the
two latter, a fevere Amour. Wherefore I conclude, that a Figure well
Proportioned and ditpoted, having a graceful Motion and Sway, and
2 Light agreeable to its Out-line and Motion, may be called a perselt
Figure.
CHAP. VIII. Of the Motion of the Members.
ET us proceed now to the second of the Parts wherein Beauty
 contifls, namely, The Motion of the Mfembers.
This depends chiclly on a contraring or Oppesstion of all the
Members of the Bodr, and on their Lights and Skaass; which give a
Figure Morion and Life: And this is chiefly obtained by a Winding,.
 S02j; as when the Face is froncing, the Body mult turn a little

A lecond Obfervation is, A Contraft in the inclining Poise of the Bo-

3. The right Knee or Foot rifing again: And the contrary on the op
pofite fide of the Body.
A third Obfervation is, that when the right Arm and left Leg at
vance, the left Arm and right Leg fall back.
But this Motion doubles, when the right Shoulder is feen fronting;
for then the Head and under Part of the Body muft be the fame, 9s
the fame Figure thews. When the Breaft rifes, the Headought to fink;

and the contrary. See Fig. B.
The Head mult always meline to the upper Shoulder, as in Fig. A.
in an erect Pofture, the Feet mult make a Rectangle, to wit, the Heel.
of the one with the inward Ancle of the other, as in Fig. C.
Hunds mult always have a contraping Motion; if one be seen inward-
ly, the otherought to be ourward; if one hang down, the other should
be railed up. The under Purt of the Arm being forethortened, the
upper Part should be feen direct. If the Thigh be forehortened, the
Lee should be direct, as in Fig. D.
The Motion of the Legs is almolt like that of the Arms, comparing
the upper Part of the Arm with the Thigh, and the under Part with:
the Leg: If the upper Part of the Arm fink, the Thigh mult rife, and
contrall it. When the right Arm is raifed, and the left depretsd.
then the Knees or Feet mult be contrary. If the Hip fwell, the upper.
Part of the Body finks into the under Part. If the Shoulders heave,
the Neck finks into them.
Here take efpecial Care, that the Hand and Arm be not on a Line;
but that each Contraft the other in an opposing Turn, as we fee in the
good and bad Examples, Fig. E.
The cross Line of the Face is never parallel with that of the Body,
either fronting or profile wife: Nor the upper Part of the Body with

the lower.
in these Motions confift, in my Opinion, the Beauty of the Body,

1. That of the Head. 2. That of the Hunds and Fect. Laflly, That
of the Body.
Thole of the Head are foursold; forward, backward, and on each
Side. Thole of the Hands and Feet are the fame.
The rms and Legs have but one Motion; to wit, one on the Et
bow, the other on the Knee; the Arm bending, and the Leg drawing
back.
The Motions of the Body are threefold; foreright, and on both
Sides.

Befides chefe, there are yet four other Sorts of Motions proceeding
from the fame Members; to wit, the simple, the active,
the paftive
and the violent.
1. The Simple is, when the Members move naturally; as in Walking,
one Foor is fer before the other; in Drinking or Earing, the Hands
are lified up to the Mouth; the Head turns, and the other Members
are made tubfervient to the prefent Altion; and to which Children,
as well as aged Perfons, naturally incline.
2. The Active confilts in carrying, pulling, thrulting, puthing, climb-
ing, and the like; which is done by Knowledge and Judgment. This
is only in part proper to Children. See Plare VIIl.
3. The Paffric arifes from Difquiets of the Mind, or what the Soul
thews by the Body in the Paffions; as Love, Hatred, Anger, Sorrow,
Por. Spite, Scorn, and fuch like
The Effelt of thefe, tho' morly inward, yet is feen from without the
Body; chieffy in the fmall Members, as the Eyes, Nofe, Mouth,
Fingers and Toes See Plate IX.
4 The Vielent, proceeding from Fright, Fear, Defpair, Rage, Cor.
or any thing that is nufual and fudden, and perturbares Nature either
by hearing or feeing; fuch as a fudden Thunder, Spectre, or frightful
Sight: Thefe caule a shrinking, fretching and winding of the Mem-
bers; to both which, Voung and Old are subject. See Plate X.
But all thefe Paftions together cannot produce a perfelt Figure,
without the Affiftance of the Members; becaute we can go up Stairs
with Hands in Pockets; or lift a Weight with both Hands, and yet
the Legs may be clofe: A Perfon can be affrighted by fomething sland
ing or lying before him, without shewing it in the Face; we can allo
be in love, and it shall not appear in our Mlotion. But my principal
Intention is, to express thefe Puspons by the Motion of the Members; and
to sbew bee each Member contributes towards them. As when the
Body rurns of winds, the Members fir, one advaing, another fall
ing back; one raifed, others finking.
But fince it is very rare to fee all thefe Motionx and Paffions, as hap
pening very feldom and unawares: And fince no Model can be to let
as to give them, I did, for Certainty, fland for them all; exprefting e
very one, even to the leffer Members, Eyes, Mouth, Nole, Fingers
and Toes; and thefe were nimbly and dextrouly, as you fee, delign
ed by my Son

f E ought to obferve in the firft Place, that the greatelt Part of
thefe Motions are but in part to be apprehended, and moftly
by reprefenting the Caufe of their Motion by the Relation
which they have to each other, whether in their Beginnings or Conclu-
Lions: For the End of one oftentimes begins another, as Anger is a
Step to Madness; Sorrow to Faint heartedness, and this produces De-
pair or Folly. This is the Effelt of moft of the violent Troubles of
the Mind, and Pains of the Body; for this Smart flirs the Members
violently, the Mutcles fwell, the Sinews, Nerves, Coc. fretch out of
meafure, nay, fometimes beyond their Power; as for Inflance, in
burning, wounding, and the like: Which Pains, tho' they produce par-
ticular Contractions in the Face and other Members, yet they would:
not be plainly Known, or diftinguished, if fomething of their Caules
did not at the fame Time appear; as Pyramus ftabb’d with a Sword;.
Eurydice and Hisperia bit by a Smake: Procris kill’d with a Javelin;.
and the Centaur Neffus thot with an rrow; Hippolytas wounded by
the Overturn of his Chariot; and more fuch. By whom we mult

framus, either the Veil of Thisbe, or the naked Sword; and by Eary.

Blood: And thus of any others. Moreover, we ought to pow the
Wound, and bow it happen’d; two Circumflances equally necelfary.
The same is allo to be obferved in Neffus, who is thot from behind;
Earydice and Hisperia bit in the Heel; Acbilles wounded in the Came
Part: All which Circumftances a skilful Mafter ought to dispofe pro-
perly. But, left thefe hints be not plain enough, I shall make them fo,.
in the following Description reprefenting,
The Death of HISPERIA.
Hisperia, Daughter of the River Sebrenus, being purfued by Esacus.
Son of Priamus, is bit in the Heel by a Smake; of which Wound the

This young and beautiful Maid is in the middle, lying on the Grats,
and furrounded by some Nymphs, who mourn her Misfortune. Her

ed Headdrets comng loofe over her Shoulders; her Gown curn’d up,
which difeovers her Thigh fiained with Blood. A Boy, lying near,
points at the poifon’d Hound, and at the fame Time puthes away 2
Nymph who is liting up the Gown, and flooping fees the Wound.
Another Nymph, coming by, with a thort-flick in her Hand, thews to
the former the Fore-ground where the Snake lies killed by Come Boys
With Sticks and Stones. Thefe Boys, in lively Altion, beat the Snake
with Sticks and Thorn-butkes; one of them tramples on its Neck;
which makes it gape; another, affrighted by it, feems to run away;
at which, a third talls a laughing.
A Wood is on the right side of the Piece. In the middle, on the
chird Ground, are feen tome ruing Willows and other Trees of the
watry Kind; behind which, runs a River cross the Piece, flowing on
the left Side forwards, wherein floar Reeds and other watry Productions.
On the Banks of this River are some Veffels and Urns, some fallen
down, others lying partly in the Water; and one flands upright by the
Stump of a Willow.
Some Veils, Reeds and his-feares, bundled together, are fcattered
up and down. Several Satyrs, Driades, and other Wood and Field
Gods appear out of the lood; tome with Pineapples, others with
Torches of the same Tree; fome threiking outragioutly, others view-
ing the Snake, others, the dead Body: Moft of them are ornamented
with wild Plants of Oak-leaves about their Heads; fome are array’d
with Goatskins, others with Deer.
On the left Side of the Piece, in the Offskip, an high impending
Rock is feen, and level with it, in the middle of the Piece, Tbetis
driving her Sea-chariot towards the Rock, in order to fave EJacus,
who has thrown himself from its Top: Here we fee him ffounce into
the Sea, and, full of Sorrow, beating the Waves with his Wings, and
heaving his Breall towards Heaven, with his Head funk in his Neck,
feems to complain to the Gods of his hard Fate.
Some who are curious, run in haffe to the Rock, with lond Cries
and Irerc’dout Arms; at which, the foremoff Figures look back,
pointing a: the Sea, to give them to underfland that is already over
with him.

whole drift of the Story: Nay, 1 dare flatter myfelf that a Perton,
not converlant with them, will obterve the Paftions in it, and the Ca-
talrophe, tho' he cannot tell who the Perfons are.
But to return to the Motions; it is certain that all upright Figures,
whether of Men or Women, mull, for Grace-fake, poife bst on one
Leg, never on both: By which means, one Hip will always rife. The
Legs ought not to be further apart than the Length of a Foot.
Walking, the Hlip can rife little or nothing; the Breaft ought to bear
perpendicularly over the Leg, which fupports the Body: If the right
Leg advance, the left muft draw back; by which means, the Body
is puthed forward: The right Arm or Elbow falling back, the lett
Arm or Hand, as alfo the Face, muft appear foreright.
The Weight of the Body of one ranning, is intirely fupported by
the Leg which advances; the Breaft projects; the Head finks into the
Neck; and the other Foot is off the Ground.
A Perfon climbing, finks his Head into his Neck, and the Neck is
crelt: If the lefe Arm rife, the right ought to incline: Contrarily,
the right Leg is climbing, and the left hangs down; the Body bend-
ing over the climbing Leg, without any vilible Swell of the Hips.
Thole who push and pult, have a different Action from each other;
and are thewn here fufficiently with thofe who curry; wherefore we
hall fay little of them: Tho' this mult be obferved, that no body can
carry any great Weight in his Hands, otherwife than on the Side where
the Hip riles; nor, on the contrary, pull down any great Weight, or
therwife than with the Hand of the Side where the Hip inks; the
Head ought to bend over the riling Shoulder.
There are still remaining two Sorts of Afotion of no lets Import-
ance than the others; namely, Befeeching and Steoping; yet this latt is
not confined to the Bed at Night, but occafioned by Accidents in ther
Day; in old Men, thro' Heaviness; others, by Exercife of Mind and
Body; Women, by domeflick Labour; and Vouth, by their Play.
And tho' we cannot properly call thefe Mctions, but rather a Celfaci-
on of Motion, yet I thought proper to exhibit them in Plare Xl.

CHAP. X. Of the diferent Colouring of the Naked, in a Child,
2
Man, and Woman; in Health, Sickness, and after Death.
A VIN G carefally ffudied this Point, I find that one Chaptes
is too little to comprehend it; neverthelets I shall here lay dow
the principal Parts of it, hoping to handle the reff in this Work
25 it comes in the Way.
Having already treated of Two of the fixed Beauties of an huma
Figure, we shall (Keeping Nature Hill in our Eye) proceed to the la
of them.
The different Coloars of the Waked are as manifold as the Objed
themfelves; nay, almoff innumerable: But we shall confine ourfelv


Chap.io. Of Penciling, second Tint, and Beauty. 25
to the three Conditions of an bealthy and fick Person, and a dead Body;
applied to a Child, Man and Woman.
The Child, being in Health, is of a roly Colour; the Man of a warm
and glowing Colour; and the Woman of a fair Colour.
But in Sickness, the Child inclines to yellowith Pale; the Man to dark
Pale, or Fallow; and the Woman to a milkith or yellowith White Colour.
Being dead, the Child is violet; the Man more grey. yet fome-
what yellowith; and the Woman like the Child, but more beautiful,
as having the whiter Skin: The Reafon of which is, that the Child,
having a thin Skin, and being full of Blood, mult appear ruddy; the
Man, being more yellow, and his Skin thicker, mult appear more grev,
fince the Blood can thine less thro' it; and the Woman, having a white
and fmooth Skin, mult therefore thew herfelf fomewhat ruddy. Hence
it is, that a Child, in its tender Parts, is more violet, a Man more
grey, and a Woman blue, yet more upon the Green than the Violet.
All this is demontirable by the Colours themfelves; for mixing Blue
and Red it becomes Violet for Children; Blue, Red and Vellow make
a Grey for a Man; and yellowith White mixed with very lirle Red
and Blue gives a Greenness for a Woman.
Now, in order to Hrike the right Colour for each, take thefe; for
the Child, Whice and Vermilion, it being prety ruddy; for the Man
the lame, with the Addicion of fome yellow Oker, which makes it
more warm, and alfo more fiery; for the Woman, take Whire, a lirtle
Vermilion and some yellow Oker. And to know perfectly the proper
Tint of the Tenderness of each of thefe three Perfons, you murt, in
Finithing, take some Small or Ultramarine alone, and, with a foft
Fitch, icumble your Blue over the moft tender Parts of your Figure,
to that it hie foft and tranfparent: And you will perceive, that this
Tendernels produces in each Figure, a particular and natural Colond
So much for healthy Nature; that of the Sick and Dead shall be spok-
ten of afterwards.
Here methinks I can fcarce underfland (tho' nothing more common)
the perverfe Opinions of Painters about Colouring; they feek after
Art, but do not underfland Nature; make large Enquiries to lictle
Purpole; and, as it were, traverfe the Earth, without moving a Step.
They talk faxever of this or that Mafter's Colouring; of one they fay
Ay, that is beautiful and freh, — of another, — That is like Fleftt
and Blood. — Another lavs, — That is very fresh and glowing.
Others, after having prauled a long Time, and ftupified themfelves

in tee Warll; I canneither findner imagine it; it cannot be nitoted.
And more fuch Talk. But what fine Thoughts are thefe! If our
Sents cannot apprehend a painted Nudicy, what muft Narure herfelf
be ? is not the Original better than the Copy? Had Titian and Geor-
gione a beautiful Colouring: Ler us follow their Manner: They chole
Narure for their Partern, withour imtating other Mlafters, becaute in
Whatever other Respects Nature may be deficient in relation to the
Art, the is certain in Cclouring; therefore the Life muft be the beft
Model; and whar is not intirely like her, tho' never to flattering, is
falle and of no worth.
As I have defcribed some Weakneffes in Painters, to the following
are no lets Evils: They precend to correct Nature, tho' the be, in Co-
louring at leaft, not to be correlted; incredibly difficult are their
fruinlets Attempts, and as difficult their Mieanings, thro' the Neglect
of effential Methods for doing Things rightly and truly.
Another Mischief proceeds from Tyro's themfelves; thefe, falling
upon the Life at firtt letting our, can hardly endure to be debarr’d by
their Matters: Bur I defire luch may know, that, by this Hindrance,
till they can copy well, their Alafters act prudencly: After this let
them proceed to the Life, fince irs certain, that they muft firtt get a
thorough Knowledge of the Alixtures of the Colours; without which,
they will make but poor Work of the Lise; belides it is far more
caly to imitate an Object painted, than one neither deligned per. co.
loured
The better meaning Artifts mult therefore not pretend to arrive at
fhe Colouring, without conjalting Nstare; for the greatelt Grace lies in
Iis Variety, vis. in Rofinels, Vellowness and Blueness, as well in Old
28 Toung, principally when each Colour is rightly applied and paty
ally reprefenced: But this Variety cannot be feen in the Academj.
Rgure by Night, but in the Day-ligure at the Drawing Schools
Now, for the docible Arcilts Sake, I shall, in the next Chapter

thofe, hst to open a Door to farther Enquiries; for one Country afe
thefe, another other Calours, and yer both good, if they at latt an

Eeuring. Bur I fuhmit all to Praftice, and their own Judgments.

Oker with it.
in a Soldier, brown Red, and a lirtle Whice in the dead Colour; fe-
cond Colour as the others.
For a fallow or Sun burnt Peafant, White, brown Red and Un-
ber for the dead Colour; light Oker and White for the second.
For a fick Perfon, White, a little Vermilion, or brown Red in
the dead Colour; light Oker and Whice for the second, yet but little
ruddy.
The Figures being brought thus far, retouch or finith them in this
Manner; bruth thinly over your Figure some Vernith mixed with 2
little light Oker; then clap on your main Lights, fcumbling them
foftly and gently into this wet Ground, as far as is neceffary: Fer a
Child mix, under the Vernish, a little Vermilion; some light Oker
for a Man; and fomewhat lels light Oker for a Woman.
But chiefly oblerve, that the shaiph Tenderness mult not be mixed of
laid on in the two firft Colourings; but, on Finithing, is fcumbled in
with the main Lights, and meked into the wet Ground of Vernifl
not with Grey or Blue mixed with White, but with pure and thief
temper’d Small or Ultramarine only, touched with a Firch-pencil, as
have already intimated.
Thus alto the Reffexions are to be managed, whether they be Rrong,
or apparent, or of what Colour foever they be; Of which, more in
its Place.
The Tints of the Naked are but three; namely, the Light, the Mex-
120, or second Tint, and the broad Sbade: But 1 except the Ruddi-
ness, which if ffo divided into three Degrees or Parts.
The three former Tints ought to be made and proceed out of one
Colour, in Shades as well as Lights, but I reckon not among them
kither the greatell Shades, or main Lights ufed in Retouching.

The Colour of a dead Body, could, by this Interpofition, have no
Place after thofe others; in fuch a Figure ule brown Oker, and White
in the Deadcolouring; which being thinly glazed with Lake, more
or lefs according to the Age and Condition of the Perfon it reprefents,
thereon paint with light Oker and Whice for the second Colouring; in
which, have a due Regard to Fingers, Toes and other imall Parts
both of Body and Face, which ought to be grey and violet, as in
living Nature chofe Parts appear roly and bluthing.
II any ask, why I expretly affign light Oker, Vermilion, or brown
Red to this or thar Body; and be not content with recommending
Red and Whire, or Fellow and Whire; he mult know, that there is
a vall Difference between Red and Red; for Inftance, take Vermilion
and White, and brown Red and Whice, and obferve how much the
two Mixtures differ in Force and Beauty; thus it is allo with the Vel
low; which makes a great Difference in the Colouring of the three
Nakeds aforefaid, and allo in their Tints.
Bur I do not abfolurely contine mytelf to thofe Colours; I name
them only as my Opinion touching them, and that I may be the bet-
ter underitood in what I fay about them.
Has the Arciff a mind, in the second Colouring, to put in the ten-
der Tints) Let him do it; but they will, on viewing the Painting at
some Diltance, appear like Spers. He will alto find more Work and
Trouble, becaute the Colours he too thick; whereby he is convinced,
and obliged to work it over again another Time.
Before 1 end this Chapter, I mult propofe one familiar Queltion,
frequently flarced; Why many Ditciples give into a worfe Manner,
than that of their Mafters? Which I refolve thus; their bad Manner
he joint Fault both of Mafter and Disciple; the Mafter's chieflj,
being tomerimes negligent in his Inftruction; for tho' he understands
the Grounds, he does not reach them his Pupils: The greateft Care
he takes, is, to put them on copring all Sores of Pieces, as well of
old as later Mafters, each handled in a particular Manner, fomerimes
quite different from his own. The Difciples, on the other side, being
conment with a fupericial Likeness, viz. this Parr as red, that as yel
low, blue or green, as the Original, (which they themfelves mul
find our by tempering and re-tempering) thence it follog
 that in one
fart or other ther generally fall into Extravagancy, Irter they hare
left their Marters. Is the Mafter's an hard Mianner? Theirs will be
harder. Was he rough? They will be rougher. He, warm and glow
ing! Ther, herr. Did he colour flaring! They will exceed him
Wtas his Mlanner to paint young and old Women alike? They wil

paint both Women and Men, young and old, after one Manner; and
make their Wives or Maid-fervants their only Models. As for Paint-
ing worle, this lies at the Difciples Door, thro' a Propenlity to
some particular Parts, without regarding the Whole: One affects Dra-
peries; another likes Nudities; another delights in By-works. But
luch mult not take it amils, if 1 compare them to Thiflles, which,
where they fall, Rick.
But a Mafter, who feeks Honour and Efteem, mult not only be
acquainted with what I have now delivered, but many more Things,
if he will be valued for Hiffory, the univerfal Paincing.
CHAP. XII. Of agreeable and beautiful Colouring.
7INCE a Piece cleanly and beautifully Coloured muft needs be
D very pleafing, as well to the Ignorant as the Knowing; and the con
trary ones be difpleating; we shall treat of it as a Matter of great
Importance: But many miss the Mark herein; some knowingly, others
againt their Wills; I fay, knowingty, in taking a Fancy to this or that
Manner, whether good or bad; and, againt their Wills, when they
are palt Recovery, and Cultom is become habitual. Sometimes it allo
happens thro' Carelessness and Fear of doing worfe: Thefe, tis true,
give good Ear, but neglect right Methods.
As a pure Light caufes Objects to appear clean and beautiful, to it
mull needs be, that the more it is broken, and fullied by Darknets,
the Objects will alfo become darker, and lels beautiful: Many oreat
Mafters have, in this very Particular, been much miftaken; as aff
the Flemiss, Rubens; and in Helland, Rembrant, Lievens, and in
others of their Followers; the one, in endeavouring to paint too bedly-
tiful, is fallen into a flaring Manner; and the other, to obtain Soft-
nets, got into a rotten ripe Manner; two Excreams, which, like two
dangerous Rocks, ought to be avoided. But Prudence obferves a Mean
in every thing; and a skilful Mafter will make a judicious Ufe of the
Colouring in general, whether in Nudities, Draperies, Landship, Stone
ork, or wit elle.
I have often wondered, how some have tormented themfelves in the
different Colouring of a Man and a Woman; painting him warm and
fery; her, tender and fair without reffeeting whether fuch Colouring
was proper to their Condition, or not: Nay, without making any
Diffinction.

thew how mafterly they can match fuch a Colour, or whether they
are fond of fuch Extravagancies, or hid Defiance to thofe who Colour
the Nakeds of Men, Women and Children with little or no Diffe-
rence, I will not determine: But mult at leaft obferve, that tho' good
Colouring in general is very commendable, yet what we moft thew our
Jnagment in, is, the giving every Object its proper Colour, according
to its Asture and Quality; for the Difference among Objects on the
fore Ground ought to be much greater than thofe of the second or
third Grounds, becaute the Diftance or Medium of Air between, y
nires every thing leis or more, as welt Colours as Objects.

How often do we find, that when we betake ourfelves to Thought,
e are, by fome outward Caufe, interrupted, and our Projelts poilt by
the Confution of our Senfes; to obviate which, is beft to be alone;
and then, having Paper, Pen and ink, or a Crayon, and fettled the
Scheme of your Ordonnance as to Height and Length, you mult mark
out the Plan or Ground, and fix the Pomt of Sight, whether the Delign
he Landsk: p, or for a Chamber, Palace, Grotto, or what elfe: After
this, weigh well your whole Delign; then, what Sort of Perfons mult
enter ir, and who ought to have the firft and most visible Place; which
mark in antly, and their Bigness, not in Figures, but Strokes; here on
the firth Ground, there, on the second, according to their Charalters
and Meries; beginiing with the King or Prince, and next, his Reti-
nue, or other proper Perfons: If there be sill another Party to be
incroduced of less Moment than thefe, and yet as effential to the Or-
donnance, mark it with Points in its proper Place, without more
ad0.
Having brought your Delign thus far, you may, some Time after-
wards, reaffume the Thoughts of it, beginning with the principal Fi-
gures; and now confider by what Passions your Figures are moved; how
they ought to fand, ft or he; what they are doing, whether they fy
or run, and whether before or againft the Light; how they contraft,
and how they shall be fer of againtt each other. Skeich all this on
another Piece of Paper, and tho' in to doing fome Circumftance may
have been omitted, ver the Confequence cant be great, fince the let
fer. like a River, flows from the greater, without Burthen to the
Memory.
Go to your Sketch again at some other Time with freth Thoughts,
and then contider what Charafters muft be naked, what cleathed, what
beautiful, what common; together with the proper Colouring, and its
Agreement and Order. Thus the Delign is brought to bear, and this,
in my Opinion, is the fureft Way to help and eafe the Memory.
Thus much of Ordonnance in general, proceed we to treat of each
Part in particular.

Matter for above three limes as many Compolitions. The Caule of
all this, I find, after much Pains and inquiry, to be Ignarance and
Carclessness, thole two impotent Silters, who check the Senles and ob-
Rrult Inquiries; an Evil to be cured only by diligent Exercife,
We need not doubt, but that the ancient Painters have pick’d fuc
the beft Hiffories; but tis Felly to think they therefore delpited all

the reft. It were unhappy, if the Secreis still remaining had pfen ye=
fore all difcovered; for then we might bid adieu to an future Endea=
yours. But suppoling, that the beft Subjects are cholen, it falls out
neverthelels that thofe which are flighted are ofcentimes the imott


painter-like; and have the sirongeft Passions; and at the lame. 1ume fbe
most clegant Ry-works; to that we need not defpair of sufficicat Masies

to handle.

But we fee in Cattle that they will follow one Leader; and to it 

with fome Painters, who think they have done enough, when between

their Compolitions, and old ones on the fame Subject, the Differeace

Thefe Things I judged preliminary to what follows; and therefore
we shall proceed to the Management.
CHAP. III. Of the Ordennance of Hisfories.
HE Management of Hiffory will ferve for univerfal Condul
throughout this whole Work; for no one can be faid to be a
good Mafter, without a perfelt Knowledge of it: It is foge-
eral, that it affelts every Branch of the Art; as the grouping of Fr
gures; placing of Colours; Choice of Light and Shade; laying Grounds;
nay, even the Difpofition of each fingle Figure: But I shall neverthe-
lets be brief, and to proceed
When now you have cholen your Subject, whether in Hiftory,
Filtion or Emblem, make a rough Sketch of it, and to imperfecdly
as only to underfland your own Marks and Strokes: Then read with
Ritention the beft and exafteff Writers of the Stery, in order to conceive
it well, and fix it in your Nemory; marking immidiately what you have
reid
On your next Return to this Sketch, you mult principally confider,
in whot Country, in what Season, and what Time of the Day, the Aei
on happened; and whether within or without Deors; whether in state
B Places, or common ones; and lattly, the Quality and Dignity of the
Perfons concern’d; thus much for Circumftances: Now mind exactly
the Efence of the Story, and then the Accidents proper to it. The
Event of the Story mult always fill up the chief Place in the Compo
fition; and the Beginning of it to be dilpoted in the Ofship; as a Can-
mon hall, fhor from a Diftance, batters a near Bulwark, and fcatters
whatever opposes it; by this means the Driff of the Matter will ap-
pear at firft View: Note all thefe Things in your Pockecbook, that

you may remember them; and be fure to confult them often for that
Purpofe.
Some Day afterwards, early in the Morning, when your Head is
caty and clear, re -confider the whole Matter: Imagine yourself to be the
Figure; which (one after another) you are to exhibit; and so proceed to

the most inferior.
Next, extend your Thoughts to the Places where the Attion happen
ed. This will bring you to apprehend the Nature of it; and you will
quickly perceive all your Figures in Order, and the Quatities of
each, their Distances and proper Places: Mark this in General with
Strokes enly. Put each principal Perfon's Name to his Firure, that
you commit no Miltake in them, for the Difpoficion slp our of
your Memory. After this, you mult mind every other particular Fi-
gure: And lattly contider, by what Passions they are all moved.
By this Method it is certain, that we are far advanced in General,
but litle in Particulars; the Delign is as yet no more, than as if a
Perfon, flanding on an Eminence, or the Top of a Steeple, were
viewing, in an open Country, the Preparations of a great Army. I1s

whether it mult proceed from the left, or the right, from bebindior

next, difpole the reft of the Figures in Groups, fome of twe or three,
others of four or five, more or lets, as you think proper. But of this,
we shall fay more in a particular Chapter.
in the mean time; to help thofe who may not prefently apprehend
this, we shall give an Example from off the fore Ground: I lay then,
that you mull place your principal Figares confpicuous and elevited
upon the fore Ground; give them the main Light, and greateff Force
of Colouring, in one Mass, or Group; the less Objects must be fome
what lower, and their Force of Light and Colour more fpread THe
second Ground ought to be in Shade, or filled with shady Objectss and

behind them, on the third Ground (which mult be Light again) dispose
the Objects of fmalleft Confequence; obferving always, that large Ob.
jxts are placed behind small ones, and fmall Objects behind large ones;
as allo flrong Lights againt dark Shades; if you cannot find it by the
Shade, endeavour to effect it by dark Colours, as we shall thew more
amply in another Chapter.
Having got this far, make your Skerch apow, on another Paper,
wherein deagn all the Nudiries after the Life, and the Draperies from
Tee Laymss, Figure after Figure, as finithed as poffible; dilpoling eve
by thing to to the Light, that nerther more nor lets Shade appear, than
the Whole requires. Forget not to place your Figure and Layman a
greeable to the Point of Sight in your Sketch.

Now contider the Aletions and Passiens; which, to reprefet natu.
rally, I hhall here thew a proper Method; flanding before a Looking-
plais, make, with jour own Body, fuch Actions and Motions as your

Figures require; the Passions you, muff conceive from the Hillpry
fox Initance, for a Figure in a Fright, obferge how. you: fland,  what

joh are doing with the right Hand; and where the left, isq: hew. you
turn your Head; what the left Leg is doing, and what, the right; how
you bend your Body, and to forth: Skerch all this with their Circum-
Dames, without heeding Proportion, but the Motion of the Members
. Then fet your Layman is that Skerch, difpoling it, to, as. you
hallneed it in your Ordoanance, chuting the moft begutifid Side, bef
Light, and moft advantageous Shodes for the Purposes. If the Figure
mull be cloathed, caft your Draperies as fine as poffible, accerding to
his Charafter. Then delign it curroutly on blne or Drawing-paper; but
fwith the Natel fram the Life only. Take the same Methad in other

which is not borrowed from Prints, or other Mens Drawings. Are they
to compofe an Hiffory, Emblem or Fable, they bring it together
Piece-meal, and by Scraps; and fearching their whole Store of Prints,
Drawings and Academy-figures; take an Arm out of one, a Lee eut
of another; here a Face, there a Drapery, and out of another a Body
in order to make of the Whole an Ordonnance: But towhom does the
Honour belong! Has fomebody uted an Ordonnance of Poufin, is the
Delign that Perfons, or Poufins? This is like Duck-eggs harched by
an Hen, and we are puzzled to know to whom the Praile is due; but
its certain, that if the true Owners of fuch borrowed Goods were each

to take his own from fuch Painters, 1 fear their genuine Offspring
would be but fmall; it would even fare with them as with Eresmnss
Cuman Ass, who, with the Lion's Skin, look’d terrible, but his Ears
difcovering him, he was sript of his borrowed Cloaths, and feverely
bantered by every one.
But another Mifchief attending this Method of Proceeding is, that
it makes them flight the Life, nay, oftentimes forget it; whereby,

and the Neglect of Rules, they never become good Deligners.
The necelfary Ufe of Prints confills herein, that next to what has
been laid in the preceding Chapter, and the Skerch fetrled,, we in-
form ourfelves what great Mafters have thought and done in the fame

Subject; how they chofe their Objects, and with what By-works of
namented; this will improve our Thoughts. The next Thing we hre
to obferve, is, the Grace of their Actions, Faces, Lights and Shades;
and if any thing be for our Purpofe, sock it in the Life, or if Draper
fies, take them from the Layman; thus we may call the Work our own
But above all, we mult make ule of Academy-figures of our own Do=
Lign, especially thofe done in private. No Figure muft be painted
twice in one Ordonnance, without urgent Necefficy: But the following
Ornaments, whether our own or others, we may lawfully ufe; fuch as
Trees, Stones, Tombs, Fountains, Urns, Statues, Ruins, all Sorts of
Architecture, and other Ornaments, as much as we pleafe. He who
goes further, bigots himfelf fo much to Prints, and other Mens
Thoughts, that he thinks himfelf under a Necoffity to exprets every
Thing their Way: But it's certain our im in viewing Prints is twe
fold; firfl, to footh and pleafe the Eye; next, to enrich our Thoughts
when we are about a Compofition of our own; for then they prove of
the greaseff Advantage to a Tyro, in giving him not only fine Thoughts
bit alfora pleafant and beautrful Manner, agreeable feffures, gracefid
Actions, well-call Draperies, and, whats above all, a Quickness of

CHRP. V. Of Probability; and what is Painter- like in an Orden
nance of few or many Figures.
ROBABIL IT V, as operating on the Mind and Imagination
by the Helo of Sight, ought chiefly to be obferved in the Par-
fition and Representation of Hiftories, and is next in Confideration
to the three Branches wherein Beaury confifts; of which we have al.
ready fpoken.
it ought to appear not only in general, but in each single Object;
and we mull take Care to rejell every thing repugnant to it.
in order to it, contider what Charafters the Subjett confifts of, whe
ther of People of Fathion, or ordinary People, or of both mixt; let
this appear in their Carriage, Shape, graceful Motion and pleafant
Colouring, as being People of Education.
If the Figures be ruffical, let Rufficity be vifible in them, not on-
ty in Dress, bu: in their Behaviour, Colour and Motion; and if
therein fome Agreeableness appear, let it Hill favour of Rufficity.
By this Means, and what follows, your Thoughts will appear natural
and likely, to wit, by giving mere or less Beauty to Pertons of Condition,
and more or less Simplicity to meaner Perfons; one may be thort, ano
ther tall; one fquab and corpulent, another thin and flender; one
fomewhat crooked, another of a brown or pale Complexion; one of
2 quick, another of a flow Motion: Nay, in three or four Figures
there ought to be at leaff one quite unlike the reft; I might fay, that
hardly any two ought to be alike; among 6 or 8, one at leaft should
be hunch back’d: And tho' this may feem to contraditt what we
have before faid touching Beauty, yet it gaintays it not in reference
to Condition, fince an Hunch back, wry Shoulders, difforted Hips, a
bigger or lets Head, have as good an Agreement with the other Mem
bers, as the moft handfome-made.
If it be asked, what would be wanting if the Figures were all well
proportioned, yet some inferior to others in Beauty! I antwer, that
thele laft but in fome meafure partake of the Agreeablenets of the
others, and one in a lets Degree than another; and as it is a Truth

that great People are subjelt to Deformity of Body as well as firtle
ones, to their Deformity is not to vifible as in meaner Perions.
Hence, I think my Opinion not ill grounded, that chieffy in refor-
tual Compoficions, fuch as Plays, divine Services, Courts of Juflice,
and Concourfes of all Sorts of People, all Sorts of Shapes are to be
introduced; as crooked, thort, tall, awry, fat and lean, and even fome
same and crippled, as Occation requires; but then they mult be to
diffected, that, without Offence to the Eye, they do by Comparifon
infentibly fet off other Figures near them; which is a main Proof of
the Likelihood or Probability of an Hiffory: But to make this Point
the plainer, I shall thew the Difference between one old Perfon and a-
nother, and one young Perton and another, each in a lets or greater
Degree of Beauty; and confirm it by Examples.
As for the handling of Fables and Emblems, thefe, leing not Falts,
but Fictions, confifting moftly of Virtues and Vices, require a quite
different Management; for in reprefenting Virtue no Blemith muft ap-
pear, and in Vice no Perfection.
As to Deities, who ought to be perfect in every Respect, we
shall, as Occafion offers, write more at large, and treat of them
throughly in a felect Chapter; and in the mean Time thew here fome
different Hlandlings of the fame Thing in Perfons of different Conditi-
ons, as in Plate XII.

This pleating Air is admirably obferved by the great Rapbael and
Correggio, and particularly by Barocci, as we may fee in a find Print
afier one of his Paintings, where Mary is reprefented with a Spoon in
her Hand, taking some Spoon meat out of a Dith, held by an Angel,
in order to give it to the Child Ixsus, who, half fwaddled, flands
in her Lap: This Print is, in my Judgment, to admirable for
Grace, and to natural, modeft and great, that nothing could be bet

the Body; the intide of the Hand turned upwards; Fingers loofe and
airy bending downwards; hearkening with Attention, the, with the
other Hand, lifts up a Part of her Garmert. She flands flreight; her
Head turned fideways, a little forward; her Knees and Feet ciofe, and
one Heel turned towards the inward Ande of the other Foot: Now,
on comparing the other Woman flanding by her, likewife liftening, we
may fee what a Difference Education makes in People's Attions;
both her Hlands reft on her Hips; the flands on both Feer without any
Sway; the upper Part of her Body bends a little forwards; her Brealt
and Chin advance; her Head fomewhat toffing; her Morth a lirtle
paping; but her Hlips fwell not.
In tuch Obfervations as thefe, confiff the very Nature and Grace of
a Compotition, be it of many or few Figures, in reference to Persons;
and therefore I cannot too much enforce the Enquiry into to important
a Point: I fpeak here of grand, majefic and most agreeable Action;
for the contrary is naturally and daily to be found in us; and tho' ma-
ny would be better thought of, yet they thew the contrary by daily
Converlation with mean People, whereby they slip the Opportunity of
getting better Ideas of genteel Carriage, contenting themfelves with
thooting at Random only. However, they excule themfelves, by fay-
ing, that they have no Opportunity of getting into fine Company; a
weak Shield to defend their Sloth! Do not the Church, the Playhoule,
and the Park give them Hlandle enough to fee fine People, and to ob-
ferve how they behave? As for me, before I had the Happinets to
which we may fometimes arrive by the Smiles of Friends, I mift no
Opportunity of making Obfervations, and noting them in my Pocket-
book; which an Hiltory-painter ought always to have about him,
wherever he soes: And with good Reafon; for Thoughts are often fo
volatile and llippery as to be retained with Difficulty, as I have before
intimated in the firff Chapter about Ordennance. Nay, when I faw an
handlome Gentlewoman walking in the Street, I made it my Bulinets
to enquire into the Recson of ber Grace, and in what it contifted, and
wby she appeared more agreeable than others; and on the contrary, why
ych Refealches as thefe, we come to the

Things; which, as I have faid, when once loft, may perhaps never be
retrieved.
Many miltake, who think that magnificent Garb and rich Ornaments,
as Jewels, Pearls, gold and filver Stufts, Cc. are infallible Marks of the
Greatness and Power of People: But can the moft Difcerning certainly
conclude them to be fuch by thefe Tokens, without enquiring whether
their Education be equal to their Grandeur? Even then allo they may
be deceived, fince fome mean People have naturally, or by Imitation,
fuch an Air and Carriage, that, were their Dress anfwerable, they
would be taken for great ones: The Reafon of which is, that at firtt
Sight there appears uttle Difference between falfe Jewels and true, tho'
on a nice Enquiry may be found; as in the Jewels, fo in their Altions
and Behaviour, fuch a Difference as points out their true Character.
Again, if thefe different Conditions depended only on rich Cloaths,
nothing would be more ealy to a Painter than this difficult Part of rt;
fince at that Rate there could be no Fathion; or a Broom-sick might
become a Lady's Hood Nevertheless there have been, and sill are,
Painters enough infelted with this Opinion, and follow it as a Law;
thinking that Drvid, Solomos and Abasucrus would not be known for
Kings, did not their Crowns thew it; thefe forfooth they mult always
have wherever they are, and as well in the Bed-chamber, as on the
Throne; and the Sceptre as well at the Table, as at the Head of an
Army. I fay nothing yet touching their royal Robes.
He who duely weighs what I have been faying, muft allow, that
State and Carriage are two fuch excellent Qualifications, that a Picture
cant be faid to be good without them; nay, I think them the very
Soal of a geed Piftare: But as a noble Soul, in a well-haped Body,
without the Addision of Ornaments, vifibly shews itself, to of Courte,
tirch are needlets in exprefting true Greatness: indeed, when Ornaments
are introduced with Judgment and Caution, they add to the Splendor
of a Pixture, but nothing to Charafter, nor can cause any Passions; 2s
we fee in Raphael, Pouffin, Deminichine and Barecir, who, far from
approving it, have, by the very Simplicity of their Figures, Thewn
the extraerdisary Greatness I have been (peakipg of.
If any object, that Rapbait himself has,not obferved this Condult

which being done in my Apprenticeship 1 am ftill under some Conterr
for; but by the Incroduction of the Sunfhine, his Thoughts may poke
fibly be finer than they appear at firft View, becaute, had not the Sium
thone on that amorous Couple, Abimelech could not, at his Distance
from them, have feen their Courthip; and if he had reprefented them
in any other Corner of the Room, than that where they were, they
could not have been ficting. However, fince great Malters have their
Failings, tis probable, that Raghaets Bible-prints were fooner or lat-

wards retouched by himfelf, fince tis impoffible that one Mafter could

fake of Improvements, and to give the laft Hland, and the urmoll Per-
feltion to them: But as for this Bible, if it be obferved with Attenti-
on, there will be found a great Difference between one Ordonnance
and another, tho' in some, the Greatness and Likelibood are well pre-
served.
But to conclude the Matter of this Chapter, I mull lay, that my
Precepts ought not only to be obferved in an Ordonnance of many,
but of few Figures alfo, fince it is very difficult to bring them all into
one Story: But if the Subject be Courtly, as of Solemen, Abaswerus,
or fuch-like, it muft be Known, that the Perfons, to whom Majetty
and Grace are moft proper, ought to exceed in it, viz. The King a
mong his Courtiers; the Queen among her Ladies; a Governour among
Citizens, and thus the greater above the lets, according to his Quality,
Office or Dignity; this caules a proper Diltinction of Superiority, and
exalts the prime Perfon above the reft.
Even Peafants, who are a little converfant with the Towns, and Know
tomewhat of good Manners, are obferved to turpals others worfe carriaged
than they, in their Difcourfes, Holiday-mirths, and Church-ceremo
nies; but Clownithness mult appear in them, tho' with respect to the
Paffions, some may appear to excel others; except that if a Burgo-
mafter, or topping Citizen be mingled amongft them, he mull appear
tuperior to them all by his handsome Carriage, and City-behaviour.

CHRP. VI. Of the Difference between Touth and Age, in both
SexeS.
HE Artiff ought not only to mind nicely the Actions, but allo
the Difference of the Perfons who are to compofe his Ordounance;
and he mult have great Regard both to univerful and parti-
:uler Differences, as well in the Sexes as their Ages.
Children alter commonly every three Vears, and till they are
fix Vears of Age, have always thort Necks and round Fingers. The
Difference between Boys and Girls is vifible in their outward Parts,
without opening their Legs, as Tefa does.
In the imall Members the Difference is not very vifible, tho' Girls
are fomewhat thinger, have fmaller Ears and longer Heads; their
Arms are likewife more round next and above the Wrift, and their
Thighs thicker than thofe of Boys: But the upper Part of Boys Arms
is thinner and fmaller.
Thofe of Francefco Quefneyare incomparably fine to paint after; nay,
nobody has attained his Perfeltion; we fee his often reprefented either
without Hair, or but very little; whether he thought it more beauti
ful, or it was his Choice in making Models, I cannot determine; yet
methinks Boys may very well fomerimes be allowed Hair, and that
frequently curled: Girls may have theirs twifted and wound on their
Heads, with flying Locks, ferving not only for Ornament, but Diftinc
tion of Sexes
Boys of or 6 Years old may have Hair finely curl’d; Girls more
thick and diplayed; another Difference in the Sexes may be this
that Girls Hair is more foft and long, Boys more curl’d and short.
Children of g, 6 or more Vears old ought feldom to be reprefented
with clofe Mouths; their upper Eye-lids are generally hid under their
fwelling Brows; they have commonly a quick Look.
Voung Damfels have a vigilant and lively Look; raifed Forehead;
Nofe a little hollowed; a small but almoft half open Mouth; round
L:ps and small Chin, in which, as in the Cheeks, is a small Dimple;
tney have no under Chin.
Virgins we lee feldom open -mouth’d; their Eyes are more fedate
and compoted than the others.
Old

Old Women ought to have a more fet and heavy Look, and hollow
Eyes; their upper Eye-lids large and loofe, yet a little open, the un-
der Lids vifibly fwelling; Noftrils fomewhat contracted; Mouth clofe,
and fallen in: And when they are very old and without Teeth, their
under Lip comes over the upper; they allo have Rifings under the
Cheeks on each Side of the Mouth; a long but little crooked Nofe fuits
them; but in Men a more crooked one is proper.
People in uchority become a grave Look, a Forchead fomewhat
raifed, and large heavy Eyelids, and thofe half open; their Aspect
fettled and calm; their Faces turned a little fideways; the Nofe alike
with the Forehead and Eyes; Mouth thur, and a double Chin
it is necellary to take particular Notice of the different Make and
Form of Persons, to far as they are defcribed in Hiffory, in order to
exprets the better the Nature of the Matter; as Alexander and He-
phestion in the Tent of Darins; wherein Hephetion ought to be taller
than Alexander: in Saul and David, the former tall, and the latter
less and ruddy. And thus of any other Circumftance of Hiftory.
We should here have brought in some Examples of Phyfiognomy;
but as there is lately publifhed, on that Subject, a fine Treatife written
by Mr. le Brun, and trantlated by F. de Kaarfgieter, we think it not
necellary to fay any thing about it, but refer to the Book, fince its of
Service not only to Painters, Statuaries and Engravers, but allo to Po-
ets, Hifforians and others.
in the Obfervations about taking and bolding any thing, I have taken
Notice that Infants are very fickle and harmlets in it, and becaute
their Members are very feeble, and commonly ply any Way, they
all as if half lame; their Hands are always fquab, and therefore moll
Open.
Toung Girls are wanton in their taking and holding; as in the Man-
Rer of Goltzius.
Virgins and payed Women are modelt and mannerly in their taking
and holding; as I have shewed before.
But aged People have fiff and dry Hands; for which Reafon they
are moft Times thut, and they cannot extend their Fingers.
Altho’ different Accidents caule an Alteration in the Face and Polture,
thole Alterations are neverthelels very unlife each other, therefore
each ought to be handled in a diftint Manner; chieffy when any par-
ticular Passion moves us to this or that Action, whereby the Features
and Lincaments of the Face are deubled by the faid Unlikeness.
Suppotes.

Suppote, for Inflance, that all Faces were call in one Mould, and
euch governed by a particular Passion, as Sorrew, Gladnels, Hatred,
Envy, Anger, Madnels, Coc. Hence its certain, that they will be
very unlike and different; as well as the Actions of the Body: And if
now you give each a particular Make, and Lincament, this will ang-
ment their Difference.
This Obferration is of great Ule to Face and Hiffory-painters, and
the contrary as ufeful when Nature and Circumflances induce us to
make fue or three to be like each other in one Compofition; name-
17, a Company of Figures all of one Family, who therefore may
well take after one Person in Likeness, as the Sons of Tacob; the Ho.
rotis and Caracis; for thus we evince the Truth of the Story.
Again, in handling the Fuble, where the Daughters of Gecreps open
the Basket, in which was Ericbtonins, here we are obliged to make
their Fares alife, to thew that they are Sifters; for otherwife who
would know them to be fo, tho' reprefented alike beautiful? And it
would be asked how the Affinity appears, feeing tis not enough to
tay they are Sifters; or that Pallas is Tupiter's Daughter; or the long:
bearded Esculagins, the Son of young Apello. But if you give thele
three Sifters one and the same Aspect, yer to each a diffintt Passion, they
will then differ very much; for Inftance, let the youngeft, who opens
the Basket with Surprize, flart back, as if the were laying - Good
God, what is this? The fecond, full of Fear, runs away, calling out
Dear Siffer, face me from this Monfter! And the third, being
elder and more ftayed, fepring back, with Amazement, fays, 
What! this is a Monfer. Thus proceed three different Motions from
one Aspect of Likeness; for tho' the Retemblance is fomewhat alcered,
yet the same Proportions and Features Hill remain.
The Cafe is the same between Parents and their Children; for In
france, if the Father have a crooked Nofe, or that of a Cafar, the
Child will, in some Degree, have a Nofe fomewhat longith and rifing;
has the Mother a long and Rreight Nofe, the Daughter will have the
fame; except, that in tender Vouth tis lets or more bending, as in old
Age Tis thicker and broader, but little different in Length; as Expe
fience thews.
We fee in the twelve Heads of the Roman Emperore, their Natures
and Inclinations well expreffed, and agreeable to the Hiffories of their
Lives; yet 1 doubt, whether they all agree with the true Aspects of
thote Emperors; or, whether the cotemporary Mafters (who were
well-skill’d in Phyfiognomy) have not thus alcered them according to
their



Char. 6. Of Ordennence, or Composition.

heir Natures, father to reprefent their innate Faculties, than their
outward Appearances.
It is admirable to contider how our Senfes are furprized, when all
the particular Aspects are well oblerved according to the Passions which
they reprefent; methinks, we thereby difcover Mens inmoft Secrets;
that this Perfon fings an high Tune; that a low one; that one bellows
with Pain; another inwardly laughing; the Teeth of one chatter with
cold; another parched with Heat and Thirf; thus a fmall Line can
let you into a whole Countenance; less or more Fatness alto much al.
ter a Face.
But, for the Artiffs Benefit, I think proper to thew him a Way of
finding out all Sorts of Aspects after a certain and ealy Manner.
Ler him take a Looking-glats, and draw himself by it in fuch a
Paston as he defires, as joyful, forrowful, painful, (piceful, cec. and
imagining himself to be the Figure be wants to reprefent, draw this nicely
with red or other Chalk on Drawing-paper; obferving nicely the
Knitting of the Brows, Look of the Eyes, Swell of the Cheeks,.
Contraction of the Noftrils, Clofenets or Openness of the Mouth; Jurt
of the upper of under law -bone, according to his Pofition, whether
Rreight or bending: Then let him take a Plaifter-face, and make a.
Mould from it of Lead, or other hard Matter, in order to make af-
terwards as many impreffions of Clay as he pleafes; thefe let him al-
ter to the before mentioned Drawing, either with his Fingers, or mo-
delling Sticks, as he thinks proper, taking away fomething here, and
adding fomething there; but full preferving the general Likeness: Thus.
they will ferve inftead of the Life, chiefly when the Face, on which
the Mould was made, comes to be like the Drawing, that, by the 2.
forefaid Alterations, the rtift can allo fee how much the Features.
likewife alter..
Thus all Sorts of Paffions may be moulded with little Trouble,, and
the Moulds ufed in as many different Manners as he pleafes, whether
they are to be viewed from below or above; or in Profile.
He, who is provided with Store of such Models, will find great Helfe
from them; fince we cannot be furnished with them from the Life it-
felf; nor from our own Perfons, otherwife than in a lingle and fronting
12
Polition in a Lookingglats.. As for knowing how to make them,.
a few Days and a little Inftraction will teach us as much as is neceffa-
hy, if we can draw well.. If to thefe the Arriff add a Mould for. ar
Khild and a Womas, the Sett will be the more compleac.

Ere we conclude this Chapter, is neceltary to fay fomething of
the Disposstion of both Sexes in a Sketch of a capital Ordonnance; as
in a Concourfe of all Sorts of People, at an Offering, a Play, Coc.
where we, fee, that thofe of a Sex get together, and Vouth to
Touth, Age to Age, Men to Men, and Women to Women: Bur
voung Women, our of Curiofity, are observed to crowd under the
Peopie, and tho' notwichllanding they join themfelves to their Sex,
yet they are afraid of Mithap, and therefore, for Protections Lake,
often take Children in their Arms; but a Man of Judgment will ne-

in Places of publick Pleadings, firm and high Places should always
be affigned to Women; as againtl Stone-work, Walls, and the like;
becaule their Bafhrfulness makes them timorous, and their Repurations

Members, in order to express the Passions.
REVIo US to the Matter of this Chapter, I shall infiff on
an Obfervation, which, in my Judgment, is worth the Artiffs
Notice, as being for his Advantage, as well as his Diverfion; it
is, in affigning the Reafon why many make to little Progress in their
Studies; now 1 imagine it to proceed from their Inconflancy, and
Inkewarm Affection, which tie up their Hands, unless Neceffity
drive them to work: They often fay, —I was to lucky as to do

ellly and fedately, not accidentally, what they are about; thefe are not
facisfied with having painted a Picture well, and being as well paid for
it, but reflet how much they are furchered in the Art by it, and cor
fider, if they were to do the fame again, what lteration and Im-
provement they could make in it, fince its certain, that tho' we ir
prove by Practice, yet by shorter Ways we can artain a perfect Know-
ledge, and in a lets Time too: Our own Faultsmake alfo a deeperimpref
fion on us when dilcovered by ourfelves, than if obferved by others, be
caule we naturaily hate Reproof.
Nothing affected me more than when I found my Errors, or morere
joiced me than when I had corrected them; which nevertheless did not
fully fatisfy me; for I endeavoured sill to make what was good better.
About 24 Vears ago I had a Mind to paint in little the Story of Stra:
tenica's paying Antiechus a Vifit; I took abundance of Pains in it, and
it was extremely liked. Some Vears after, an Opportunity offered of my
doing the same Thing again, but fix Times larger; I did not think it
proper to govern mytelf by my former Thoughts, tho' much approy-
ed, but diigently confulted the beft Writers on the Subject, rejelting
the trivial ones, and then proceeded as carefully to finith my Work;
which got me more Reputation than the former, becaule executed with
more Simplicity, and less pempous Circumfances; it reprefenting only
King Selencbus, Stratenice, Antrecbus, and the Phyfician; whereas, in
the other I had introduced a train of Courtiers about them, and, in fine;
every Thing I could think of to make it look pompous and gaudy.
Thus, out of a fingle Flower we may by Care and Induflry produce 4
double one, as was the Cale of another Picture of Scipie and the young
Bride, which is in the Apartment of the States of Holland at the Rague;
this Picture was of my firft Thoughts; but handling the same Subject a
second Time, this latter, as better compoled, got the Preference tho' done
but 2 Years after the other; which I fubmit to any one's Judgment who
compares them: Now, if any one ask the Reason of this great Difference,
and in to little a Time too, lanfwer, that having perceived my ignorance
and Errors in the firft Compofition, I doubled my Pains, informed my-
felf better, madenicer Reffections, and (pared no Trouble in order to
exceed myfelf, if posfible, in the second Performance.
This Circumftance alfo attended my firft Afexander and Rexana; for
that which I painted afterwards, and is at the late Major Witzen's
Houle in mferdam, is of a much better Tafte, and very unlike the

Thus I think I have fufficienly shewn, by my own Example, the
great Difference between fitting down contented with what we Know
and do, and feeking further Improvements. Nothing delights more
than to find what we feek, and to improve daily; in order to which,
I shall give the Arciff the following Examples.
E XAMPL E I. Plate xin. Of mutual or reciprocal Love.
Two Children are feen to exchange lighted Torches, which each
gives with the lefi, and receives with the right Hand, thereby figni-
fying, that what is given with a Good will, ought to be received and
required with Thankfulness; the right Hand denoting mutual Kind
nets, or Help and Tuition.
Decency teaches, that the Giver should hold what he gives at the
upper End, and the Receiver to take it underneath, or in the middle.
The Giver offers it with an Arm freiched out; contrarily, the Re-
ceiver takes it bathfully, with his Arm clofe to the Body: Both in
cline the upper Parts of their Bodies; their Hleads lifted up, and in
clining over the side of their Giff in a friendly Manner, and Mouths
open, giving the Torches crols wife to each other; they are in all
Circumftances alike, in Beauty, Shape, Motion and Aspecl, except
a Difference in their Mouths, with respect to the Priority of In
Heatj.
The Giver holds his Torch with z Fingers, the other accepts it
with a full Hand; now, after each has received his Gift, they may
be supposed to exchange right Hands, and their Shoulders to meet,
their left Ears croffing each other, that is, their Heads come crols-wife
over their left Shoulders; and, if you pleafe, each Kilies the others
left Cheek; their right Feet advancing come clofe to each other.
EX AMIPL E. II. Of voluntary Submistion.
Here we fee a Coward furrendering his Sword to another; he holds
it by the Blade clole to the Hill; the other receives and takes it at
the Hilr. As thefe Actions are twofold, to are both the Paffions, the
one thews his Pulilanimity, the other his Courage.
The Giver ftoops his Head very low, with Eyes call down at the
others Feet; he flands on both Legs alike bent, as if he were faint
ing away; the left Hland open he is putting forth, or prefting the out-
fide of the Hand againft his Breaft, as if he were faying, — Theres

all I have, my Life is at your Mercy: The other contrarily flands fet
and upright, his right Foot advancing, his left Hand on his Side and
turning hindwards; has a ftern Look, his Mouth thut, his under Lip
and Chin Randing fomewhat out, looks with Scorn fomewhat over his
Shoulder on the Civer.

upright, and, with a fwelling Belly, is flepping forward; the Rec ex
er, on the other hand, makes up to the Giver, bowing his Bodp
retching out both Arms as far as poffible, with his two Hands ho
lowed like a Bowl-dith; looks on the Gift with Joy, Eyes Haring, o
pen Mouth, as if he were faying, — O po!

EX AMPL E IV. Of Benevolence.
He, who prefents an Apple to any one, holds it from underneath
with 3 Fingers, as friendly intreating, prefting his left Hland, intide
upwards, clofe to his Breaff; his Breaft and Chin advancing; his Head
bending fomewhat over one Shoulder. The other contrarily receives
it with Respect, taking it on the Top with 4 Fingers; advancing the
upper Part of his Body, and fomewhat bowing his Head; he difcovers
a modeft Gladnels, looking on the Gift; in the mean Time the other
is watching his Eyes.
EXAMPLE V. Plate xv. Of the same.

He, who offers his Friend a fine Flower, holds it with z Fingers,
at the lower End of the Stalk; the other takes it with the Thumb
and fore Finger, next the Flower, with his Head over it in order to
smell. The Civer, as having lmell it, draws back his Head over one
Shoulder from it, his Face lifted up, Eyes fomewhat thut, but one
more than the other, his Mouth half open; his left Hand, clofe to his
Shoulder, he holds wide oven, as in Surprize; he refts on one Leg.

Legs cloled, with his left Hland behind him: The Giver fands firm;

E. XAMPL E Vi. Of Fidelity, or Friendpig.
The Perfon, who is prefenting a King to a Virgin, as a Token of
Fidelizy or Friendhip, holds it upright, with his Thumb within it,
and the Stone upwards; he advances his Body and Face, and looks
direlt, clapping his left Hand to his Breaft: The Virgin, on the other
hand, flands or firs ftrail up, her Breaff fomewhat heaving clofe to the
King; her Head fomewhat bending and fwaying to her right Shoul
der; her leff Arm hangs down, the Hand open; receiving the King
with s Fingers of her right Hand. The Giver looks not at her Eyes,
but her Mourh, fpeaking with a Look between Hope and Fear: She,
with a modell and ferene Countenance, looks down on the King; refts
on one Leg; her Feet clofe. The Giver advances with his left Leg,
his Knce bent, and refts on his right Toes

to the Sentiments
As the Gifts in all the Examples are different,
are offen very various as well in giving as receiving.
Whether it be done in Sincerity, out of Iypoerify, or for the fake
of Decency, the Metions in either Cafe differ very little; becaute in
them all the Parties endeavour to alt with as much Dexterity as poffi-
hle; nar, fometimes to far, that thinking to impofe on each other,
both are frequently deceived: in such Cafe we mult take ppearance
far Trurh, and the contrary.
Bur firxh Reprefentations would not anfwer right Purpofe, as having
falfe Meanings; for inflead of Diffimulation or Decencr, we should
take it for pure Love, fince in all three, as 1 fay, the Motion is the
Same; therefore, to remove all Doubt and Incertainty, we mult have
Recourfe to emblemaric Figures, which will clear the Meaning, and
point our Hypocrity, Falthood, Deceit, c8c. by proper lmages,
Beal, or hneroglrphic Figures: Which By-works a prudent Arcil
4
ought to to difpote, that, tho' inactive or myfterious, they may ye
andwer their Purpote; for they who are deceived or mifled should not
perceive the leaft Tittle of it
Some may think that the Deceived as well as Deceiver ought to be
fot off with fuch Emblems; but this is fuperffuous; for as bosh Par
his feem to profels Sincerity, nothing but Hypocrity muft be thewn.
Ovid rells us, that Morcary, having stolen fome Oxen, and perceir
ing that one Butins law it, and fearfus of being betrayed, defired him

to keep it fecret; which Batras faichfully promifed: However, in order
to try him, Mercary difquited himself, and a lttle after came to him,
in the Shape of the Owner of the Cartle, and asked him whether he
could not give Tidings of them. Battas pointed to the Cave wherein
they were hid; which incented the godly Thief to much, that, reaf
fuming his Form, he beat the Traitor, and turned him into a Touch-
Rone. Now irs very probable, that in the Difquife Afercury hid his
winsed Cap and Feet, and Caduceus, that he might not be Known.
The same we find related of Tupiter and Catiffe, when he, in the
Shape of Diana, deceived her: But here the Matter would not be
Known, did not fome Tokens make it evident, that it was Tupiter
and not Diana, tho' he appeared like her.
The Cafe of fuch a Picture is the fame with a Theatrical Repre-
tentation, where every thing is exhibired as if it really happened;
the Charalters deceive and belye one another fecretly, without know-
ing it; but the Spectators perceive all; nay, their very Thoughts
ought plainly to be feen and heard.
CHAP. VIIl. Of the Ifue, or Refult of Thoughts, touching His.
tories.
S there are Grounds and Principles in all Arts and Sciences;
whereon we mult build, and we cannot, without exactly Keep-

ing to them, either execute or gain true Knowledge of Things,
to they ought chiefly to be obferved in the Arr of Painting, and efpe
cially in the Ordennance; and fince the Memory cannot furnith out a.
Story, with all its Circumftances, in fuch due Order as a regular Sketth
requires, we muft eftablith certain Rules in order to fupply that De-
felt, fince, tho' a Perfon should be to happy as to have a firong Me-
mory, and brisk Conceptions, yet the Hands are not to quick at the
Execution; no, the Thoughts excced them: Some Things allo muft

neceffarity go before, others follow which implies and requires Fime.
Could we but draw as fall as think, Memory would be ufelets; where
as irs certain, we can defiga nothing but the Ideas which Memory firft
conveys to the Senfes.
However, let no one imagine by whar 1 fay, that a Maffer muft
firtt sketch what he firf thinks, and run thro' the Defign as Things
occur to his Thoughts; for Conceptions never obferve Order, and
therefore.

therefore by fuch Irregularity, the Performance would be abortive,
as in the following Inftance: Suppofe a Reprefentation of Cain and
48el, and the Frarricide; the firft Thing that offers, is, Cain flying
from Gods IIrath; next is Abel lying dead; next the Burnt offering
on the Alcar; and laftly, the Weapon lying by it. Now the laft be
ing furthell in your Thoughts, it is firtl feratch’d down with your
Pen; then the Alcar appears; afterwards Abel; then Cain; and then
the Almighty; and ar lat the Landship, which is to determine the Big-
ness of the Compofition. Judge now what fuch a confuted Method of
deligning mult produce; tis therefore a Matter of no indifference how
you begin a Delign; for the principal Figure must be firft considered,
and thin the Incidents: As Gold is feparated from the Earth, and clear-
ed by refining. We ought then to proceed orderly in the defigning,
making arid the Plen, nest the Stone -work, and then the Figures or
By-works. However, we handle this Subject, in the Chapters of Or-
donnance of Hillories, hieroglyphic Figures, coc. Where we main-
tain, that the Principal ought to be placed firft; then the Figures of
lets Contequence; and lattly the By-works.
But whar I incend now, is, to thew a short and certain Method of
commodioully apprehending and retaining Things, whether they be
given in Urting, or by Word of Mouth, prolix or brief, together
with their Circumstances, be they many or few, that you may sketch
them exactly in all their Particulars perfectly agreeable to the Relaci-
on as well in Motion, Colour, Dress and Probability, as By-works; of
fingular Ufeto thofe of Chort Memories, but who are neverthelets skilled
in the Exprestion of Action, the Paftions and their Effeets, Ufes of Co
lours and Draperies according to Sex and Age, laying of Colours a.
gaintt proper Grounds, Difference of Countries, Sun-Chine and ordi-
nary Light; and more fuch.
Having confidered well of the Subject, and where the Action hap
pened, firft make a Plan or Ground; next, determine where to place
the principal Figures or Objects, whether in the middle or on the
right or left Side; afterwards difpole the circumftantial Figures con-
cerned in the Matter, whether one, two, of more; what elfe occurs mull
fall in of Courfe: After this, to each Figure join its Mark of Dif
rinction, to thew what it is; as, whether a King, Philosopber, Baccbus,
of River-god.
The King mull have his Minifers, Courtiers and Guards.
The Philesepher mult be attended by learned Men, or his Dif-
sifles.

Bacchus is adorned with Vine-sprigs; crowned with Grapes, and

The Water-gods are fet off with Urns, Flags, Reeds; and crown

All which Badges are naturally proper, tho' not defcribed in the

ratters remind us of them, when we are handling them: As if we

the charming Venus is actended with her Graces. This may fuffice for
personal Charafter.
As for Motions.
A King is Commanding.
A Philolopher Contemplating.
Bacchus Rambling. And
The River-ood in his Station.
When the King commands, Alls in an Hurry and Motion to execute
his Will; his Retinue are obsequious to his Words and Nods.
When the Philofepher is exerciting himfelf, he is eitber reasoning.

When Bacchus is on his Ramble, the Menades, Bacchanals, and Satyrs
madly attend his Chariot, sbreiking and bowling; and with Tabers, Pipes,
Timbrels, Cymbals, E&c.
The River-god in his Station, either refts on an Urn or Pot sbedding
Water; or is sitting among his Nymphs on the Bank of a River.
Thus each Charafter is occupied according to its Nature; and to we
deduce one Circumftance from another without feeking it, or being at a

If thefe Examples be not fufficient to eftablith my Purpofe, I shall
add one or two more; and the rather, becaute no one before me has
handied this Subject to methodically; nay, I may fay, hardly touched
on it.
We read in Scripture that Quces Eftber, over-awed by the Frowns of
King Apajuerus, twooned away. That Betthazzar, perceiving the
Handwriting on the Wall, was, with his whole Court, troubied in
Hind. Again, in Ocids Mecamorphols, Arinane, in Defpair on the
Thore, was comforted and made ealy by the acceptable Prefence of Bac-
rtas, who offered her his Aid. Fromall which, and the like Circum-
itances, we are enabled to conclude with Certainty, that a simole Paffion,
handled according to the Manner before laid down, can alone furnith
Marterenough to enrich a whole Ordonnance, without the Aid of other
By-works, fince many Things and Circumftances do proceed from that
one Faffion only. For let us luppole two Perfons paffing by each other,
as in Plere XVl. and one feen in Front the other in Rear; he who
walks on the leff Side, and is going off, has a Bundle on his right Shoul
der, from which, fomething drops behind him; he has a Boy and a Dog
with him. The other coming forwards, and perceiving what falls, calls to
cell him of it; whereupon he looks back, and the Boy runs to take it
9p Now I refer to any one's Judgment, whether my Thoughts, by
to fimple a Relation, be not prefently conceiv’d, fince tis all the Sto
Iy; I fancy they are, but yet fill better, if keeping within the
Bounds of the Relation, I were to make a Sketch of it; for tho' the
bare Description of the Thing eatily makes an Impreffion on the Sen
fes, yet he who is not converfant with the fine Motions and Beauties
of Action, (which confift moftly in the contrafling of the Members)
can never hir the Writers Mleaning.
I place then, the Man calling our foreright; and the other Man
pall by him, looking back and hearkening to what he fays: In thete
Poftures both look over the left Shoulder. Now if any one ast
whether he, who is pafting on, could not as well turn to the right as
the left in looking back, and the other do the fame! I fay, No; un

less we will run counter to Nature; for 1 fuppofe, that he who is ap
proaching has a Stick in his right Hland, and with his left points to
the Cloth which is dropt; and the other having the Bundle on his
right Shoulder, his left Hand refts on his Side, by which alfo the
Child holds him: Now, becaute each other's leic Side meets, and one
fees the Cloth dropt at his left, his Kindnels compels him (peedily to
call over the fame Shoulder to the other Man; who plainly hearing,
turns to the Side of him who calls; whereupon they behold each o
ther; the Boy, being nimble, runs quickly to the Cloth, and the
Dog outstrips him in getting to it firft: From all which Premifes is
impued a natural Motion, and furning of the Members, without our

and what they have to fay, the reft mult follow of courfe.
Such Reveries as thefe give us a Right Judgment of a Picture,
make us retain it, and help to remove Difficulties; and if to this be
alded fome certain Strokes to point out either the Place of Actions
of Figures, it would fill be more eafy and helpful to the Memory.
I know a Painter who made each Letter, or Mark, have its parti-
cular Signification: For Inftance, an L was a Figure fitting on the
Ground; a T Chriff crucified, and to forth: Moreover he had ano-
ther Secret, whereby he exprefted certain Figures he made ufe of;
as a decumbent Figure of Caraccr, a running one of Rephael, a flying
one of Berettini da Cortona, a Child of Quefnoy, Light and Shade of
la Fage, and many others.
If now the preceding Example, of the two Men paffing each other,
should feem infufficient, I will fubjoin one other of the Jame Nature,
but Falt; I mean, the Story of Tudah and Tamar, (fee Plate XVil.)
when coming from his Country-dwelling, he is in the Way accofted
by her in the Habit of an Harlot; I put the Cafe thus: Yudab comes
forward, and the Road lying on the left Side of his Houfe, along
which fome of his Servants are going off in order to theer Sheep,
Tamer fits on the right side of the Road, on the Grass, airily and
wantonly artired, and with a Veil over her Head: Now it's probable,
that having a lewd Delign, the firft accofted Yudab, who, like a Man
of Repute, paft her; but when the lifted up her Veil and beckoned
to him, he stopt to hear what the had to fay; thereupon, 1 fuppole,
he food still, refting on one Foot, and advancing the other to make
an hall, to fee who calls him; he turns to the left, opening his left
Hand like one in Surprize, and then claps it to his Breaft, to thew that

thod for handling a great Work by a thort incroduction.
If any one fuppole, that if the Road were to he cross the Piece,
and the whole Dilpolition alcered to as to make the Man go from
right to leff, and not place the Woman on either Side, it would be
all the fame, fince then the would still be on his left Side? I fay, No;
for the calling him, we should then, of both their Bodies, fee but one
of their Faces; and what were fuch a paffionlets Statue good for
Again, we could not thew his principal Motions, which are very ef
fencial to the Fact; wherefore the other Way is beft.
But let no one deceive himself by my Manner of relating this Hif
cory; for, confulcing the Scriptures, he will find, that I have inverted
the Senfe to a Subject thewing how to give two Persons diffinct Passions,
and thereby to embelith a Picture; for by the Scriptures it will ap.
pear, that Tudst is going to the Place whence I make him come, in
order to fend Tamar a Lamb or Goat to redeem his Pledge.
I leave it to any one's Judgment, whether it cannor be plainly infer
red what Morions thefe two Figures muft have, to make thereon
three diffinct and probable Reprefentacions, which I thus deduce.

Secondly, An Enquiry who the is, and what the wants.

Pafftions in borh, different from each other; the firtt, grave and mo

The Woman contrarily is moved by three Paffions.

Secondly, he approaching, addreffes her in a friendly Manner; but
altering her Speech, the antwers him roughly, and will not be

Lally, He, being transported with Paftion (at which the fecretly
laughs) the puthes him coyly from her on one Side, and lays hold of
him on the other. From all which Premifes we may find three Pe-
fitions fpringing only from the Words which we fuppole mull naturally
pals between them.
Perhaps some may lay, —1 Know nothing of fuch Effects, fince
they never happened to me.— But it's certain, there are very few
who never fell them; and even they can fomerimes account for them
better than others who have known them. Many know the Virtues
of Medicines and Poifons, without taling them; arguing with Judge

The Truth is, we can only guess at it. But this laft Story is propot

CHAP. IX. Remarks on some Mistakes in Histerical Compositions.
T will not be amiss, as a Caution to others, to cenfure some Mif
takes of Mafters in Hifforical Compositions, in order to thew of
what great Contequence it is to reprefent plainly the true Nature
and State of Things, that we may improve, and not meet with Rebuke
inftead of Glory. A Man of good Seafe may freely exercife his
Thoughts as he fees good, but many think they merit much by sol.
lowing the Letter of a Stery, tho' at the fame Time they overlook
above half its Probability; which frequently happens, when they are
got into Effeem, and hove a Name. But, alas! what rich Man would
not be thought fuch ? What valiant Man do a cowardly Action! Or
wife Man commit Folly? Only thro' wilful Carelessness; truly it
feems unnatural, and I think, that no body of but moderate Sente
would ftrive to excel in this or that Art, without being tickled with
the Detire of Fame either in his Life-time, of after Death: And al.
tho' some Inttances may contradit this, yet you muft obferve that 1
am ipeaking here of pure Firtue; for he who built the Temple of Di-
and, and he who tired it, tho' infligared by one Defire, to leave a laft-
ing Name bekind kim, have been as different in Praife as Action; from
whence I infer, that no Arciff can be void of Inclination for Praife and
Honour, which otherwife he mull not expect; and if fo, who would
blaft his Credit by an imprudent Act)
Raphael, in his Adum and Eve, has reprefented him receiving the
pple of her, and refting on a withered Stump, and that fmoothly
fevered as with an Ax or Saw; which is a double Miltake, and if done
wilfully, not to be excuted; for how is it likely, that a Tree, which
has hardly received Life, and placed to near the Tree of Life, should
to toon be withered; this muft be an Overfight like that of Cain, who
Kills his Brother Abel with a Charp Pick ax; and in another Piece
Fre has a Diltaff; what Improbability and Impertinence is this? For
when Fie has fpun her Flax, whence mutt the Weaver come, and who

for there we fee Egyptians, Persians, Arabians, Moors, Apaties,
Americans, Europeans, Turks, nay, Swiffers, all in their modem Ha-
bits: Surely we need not ask them whither they are going, becaute
the Love for our own Country prevails above all Things; and there-
fore every Man is returning to the Region whence he took his Cha-
racter, Manners and Habit. What this Painter's Meaning was, I
Know not, but, in my Opinion, tis a true Confulion.
I cannot omit another Piece of Rowland Savry, reprefenting Para-
dife; wherein we fee that facred Garden replenished with all Kinds
of ravenous Beafts and Birds, as Elephants, Rhinocerofes, Crocodiles
Bears, Wolves, Unicorns, Offriches, Eagles, (oc. which mull incire-
ly lay it wafte: Now I appeal to any Man, whether fuch a Crowd of
Bealts and Birds of Prey, contribute any thing to the Circumftance of
eating an Apple, which might as well have been done by an Ape,
Squirrel, or other imall Creature; which makes it look rather like a
Deer- park than a Garden of Pleafure. Had more People been created
than Adam and Eve, the Cherubim need not have guarded the En
trance to keep the favage Creatures out, fince they were already entered,
but rather to keep them in, in order to fave the refl of the Earth from
Incommodity. I have feen more such Compofitions, but to avoid Te-
dioufness shall not mention them here; it's fufficient, by few Exam-
ples of great Mafters, to Know how eafy it is to commit Miltakes,
thro' ignorance or Want of Heed.
Inthe firft of the aforefaid Examples, I would thew how it fares with
thofe who amule themfelves more with a small Part than the whole of

ter, without being in dny Pain for forcing Nature, or turning the
Senss. Of the second Example I shall fay nothing here, fince it may
be gueffed what I mean by the lron of the Pick-ax. Of the third.

As to Surry's Piece, my Thoughts are, that all Beafts are created
by God, bur not in the same Manner with Man; and that each Clime
Prodined it's proper Species of Anmals, which came from thence to
Adim to give them a Name according to their Natures; which was
o fooner done, but they returned to the Countries they came from;
tome to the Exl, others to the South, according to their natural In
clination to this or that Climate; to that the Garden, wherein the
Spirit of God dwelr, was only for Adam and his Confort; in it they
lived happily, and befides them no irrational Creatures, except fuch
as could delight their Eves and Ears: Moreover its my Opinion, that
this Garden could not hartour any Uncleannels, Purrefaltion of nox-
ious Creatures; wherefore my Compolition is this
Thefe two aiked Perions I place as Principals in the middle of
the Piece, on a lmall Riting, clofe to a fine tufced Apple-tree of larg.
or Size than ordinary, and of a found Body; Adam lits with Eve in
his Arms, who half in his Lap directs the Apple to his Mouth; he,
with his Face towards her, with a ftaring Eye, and raifed Brow, looks
Iurprized, and feems to put the Offer away with his Hand; to the
Acceptance of which, the, with a lovely and enticing Air, feeks to
perfuade him; at the tame Time, with her other Hand behind him,
the is receiving another Apple, which the Serpent, hanging on a Bough,
reaches out to her. Behindher is a Peacock with its Tail (pread, and 2
Cal pawing her; befides a fine Hound, who looking back is going away.
I introduce alfo Cocks and Hens, and other tame Creacures proper to
the Region for embellifhing the Landskip. I plant there all Sorts of
Trees, except the Cypress, to gracify the Sight and Palate. Small
Birds are flying abour to pleafe the Ear: The Snow-white Swans fwim
in the Brooks and Rivers which water the Garden. On the right side
of the Piece I thew the Entrance into the Place, and on the Sides, two
Square Pillars of green Leaves, befer with Melons, Pumpkins and the
like; befides a long and high green Wall, running up to the Horn-
20n, and uniting with the Offskip. The Horizon is level; along the
green Wall are feen Orange and Lemon-trees, intermixed with
Date trees. The whole Piece is enlightened with an agreeable Sur
Chine.

Chap. 9.
Of the Flight of ADam and EvE.
I was formerly of Opinion, that when this Pair received their Doom
and were driven out of Paradife, and both subjected to the fame Fate,
the Beafts mult fly with them, having learnt to know their own Narures;
wherefore I intended to make my Ordonnance accordingly, to wit,
the two naked and afhamed Perfons flying from the fiery Sword which
threatens them; and for Embellishment, a great Confution of Beafts
each attacking the Enemy of its Kind; as the cruel Wolf fetting on the
innocent Sheep, the Charp-fighted Eagle on the timorous Hare, and to
forth. But as by this Violence the main Action would intirely lofe
irs Force, and fall into a perverted Senfe, I deifted till I had better in
formed myfelf of the Matter, especially feeing no Bealt fayed in the
Garden, but each recurned to his Country. I thought again, how
can this be like the Flight of Adum out of Edenl It looks more natu
fally like two condemned Malefactors driven into a Foreff to be de
voured of wild Bealts; which their Fear and frightful Looks make
more probable; and therefore1 afterwards contrived it thus.
in Adam's Flight the labouring Of accompanies him to help him in
tilling the Ground; the fealy Serpent moves before, turning and wind-
ing on her Belly; by the Ox are the long-bearded He, and wanton She-
goat; the woolly Sheep; the crefted Cocks and Hens, and other fuch
like Creatures for Sultenance. As allo the faithful Dogand pawing Cat,
and luch other tame Animals as are proper in an hieroglyphic Sente; af
ter thefe, follow noxious Creatures, as Rats, Mice, Coc. No Sun-
hine appears, but all is gloomy, and the Wind blows hard, whereby
the Trees thake, and their Leaves drop; all is walte and wild as if Win-
ter vere at Hand; the rugged and dry Ground, parted by the Heat,
makes here and there Ups and Downs; the Water in the Fens being
dried up, the Frogs gape for Breath; the Sun being quite hid, the
Moonor North-ffar appears: Such were my Thoughts of this Story.
I will end this Chapter by skerching a third Composition of my own,
for the ftudious Cattle-painters Bencht, being the
Story of ORTHEUSs Death.
I lay the Scene in a defolate Place, yet filled with Men, Bealts,
Trees, Hills, Rocks, Warerfalls, and Brooks full of Fith, and
What can be more proper to the Macter, all being in Diforder? Ovid

Shade: Next we behold the mfalting, mad and intoxicated Women girt

River running on one side: A young Girl, who Kings in his Harp, is
likewife driven by the fame Frenzy: Behold now a Gurzler who (tho'

Kicking the Body, and flinging a Drinking-pot at it, which makes her

its Enemy; the hurtful Moufe, cill now ficting quietly by the party-
coloured Car, hangs in her Mouth; the greedy Wolf feizes the Sheep
by its Throat; the faithful Hen elcapes the thiewith Fox, who near a
fallen Fir-tree carches the latcivious Dove; the Hills and Rocks retire
clathing againft each other, whereby they tumble; here we fee an huge
Stone; there a flying Tree; nay, the Water itfelf feemsto flow back-

ed by the Vulture and other Birds of Prey, dive under Water, but yet
the white Stork ffies with one of them in his Bill; the cautious Hare,
runing from the [wiff Dog, fops thort, whereby the Dog ooes over
him, and the Hare, to make her Elcape, takes a fide Courfe. The black
Raven and folicary Oul chatter in the Tree at one another, beholding
the murthered Body, which they defire to ear; and by it lies the faithful
Dog howling, regardlets of any thing elfe. The Piece has no agree
able Sun thine, but the Air is fformy, and full of driving Clouds fore
boding a Tempelt; the principal of the Compolition is fhady, and
fung off by a light Lomtain, which is almoft in the middle.
Thus I enquire into the genune State and Nature of Things, like
an Huntlman, who tracing the Courfe of a Deer finds at lail his Cover;

thing cend to the clearing up and better understanding them in their full

A well grounded Thought leads the Way to many others; even to
it happens here in this Poers Fable, laid down as a Truth; nay to
agreeable to the Truch of the Flood, and Noabs Prefervation, that
there is lirile Difference between the Truth and the Fable; for what
is in the one is alfo contained in the other; and the Circumflances of

receiving the Stones from Capid, which each Time the cafts away,
and he, walking along, takes up before her; Dencalion’s Garment is a
fullied Purple; her Drets old and dark, and her Gown violet; Cupid
is adorned with a red Diadem; the Grass, full of Mud and Sand, lies
fat. A little from thefe Figures is Tbemis's Temple, built on an E-
minence, and supported by Columns, or a clofe Wall quite over- grown
and full of Moss; this Temple is furrounded with fine and blooming
Trees, and near behind it is feen the two headed Mount, pafting by
the Point of Sight, and encompaffed with Water.
On the left Side, in the Offckip, I reprefent the Ocean full of Tritons
and Wercides fwimming about the Mount. To this Hill I fatten an
Anchor, the Rope whereof is tied to the Boat, which, being left by
the Water, remains hanging Keel-upwards.
Thefe are the principal of my Conceptions; as for the leffer Cir-
cumflances, I shall not limit them here; fuch as the difperting of the
rainy Clouds by the Eaff Wind; Re-appearance of the covered Hills
and Rocks, Difcovery of Buildings damaged by the Water, Pieces of
Wrecks, Statues, Sea-monfters, Bones of Men and Bealts, Ornaments
and other Remains appearing here and there out of the Mud, Plath-
es, and infinite other Things removed by the Force of the Waves from
one Part of the Earth to another, and wathed from Eaft to Well; all
which I leave to the Artiffs Difcretion.
But now it may be asked why 1 introduce Capid, who, in Nasos
Description, is not mentioned; and I give this Reafon, that he being
the eldeft of the Gods, and, according to Hefsod, brought forth of
Chaes and the Earth, by him contequenly all Things are produced,
according to the Poets; therefore it's probable, that in this second Cre-
ation he can be (pared no less than in the firft: Love was alto the Prin
cipal, nay the only Paffion, which thefe People preferved to each o-
ther after their great Misforcune, and which they cherifhed by their
Simplicity and Uprightness.
Again, tho' they were aged, and near their Ends, yet they were
Hudying Means to efcape Death, and to render their Race immortal;
and who, of the Gods, can contribure more to it than Cupide Mutt
not Tupiter himself own his Sovereignty ? Therefore, tho' the Poet
makes Mention but of two Perfons, yer Reafon permits, nay, would
have us bring this God into their Company; especially fince Painters
have the Liberty to add new Matter, and more Figures for Orna-
ment take, when they are pot repugnant to Nature and Likelihood;

Add then freely, when the Writer is filent, one or more Figures to

Affer having entertained you with my Conceptions of this Stery,
give me Leave to exhibir a Reprefentation of the fame Subjet

dace Iruth, and thereby thew the Validiry of a Rule, which is level

his Piece on the Eafel, and thus entertained them.
Behold, Gentlemen! here is a Proof of my Judgment and Art; 1
 call neither the Learned, nor the Virtuofi to unfold its Mleaning; no,
an ignorant Pealant can tell it you at once. There is the World

Ruins and Rubbish; no living Creature is to be feen but Deucalion
and Pyrrba, and their three sons and their Wives, all done to the
Life. Now who will not take this to be a Flood, and believe that
all happened in this Manner! Look there, I myself am fitting on the

my part, I think that no one before him ever reprefented fuch our of-
the way Thoughts; many indeed have now and then erred, but being
made fentible of it, they have rectified their Mistakes; whereas this
whole Compolition was but one Miltake; Scripture jumbled with Fa-
ble; Moses with Ovid; Anriquiry with Novelcy; a Cardinal's Cap.
Vatican, Cards, Things found out a thouland Vears after, with An

CHRP. XI. Of the Ordennance of hiereghphic Figures.

and Emblems, but in carving Statues and Bas-reliets for great Men and
their Palaces.

wteful Book for all Perfons whole Art has any Relation to Painting;

Ufe of that Book, according to the Occation, and Difference of the
Subject, which by that great Writer is not laid down; fince its with-
out Dilpute, that each Figure muft express no other Paltion than its
own; but when they are uled for By-works or Ornament, to illuftrate
someprincipatreal Charaffer, chey muft then subferve the Ends for which
they are introduced; for inftance, in a Fight, Victory should attend
the Conqueror; Honour or Fame, an excellent Man; Love, or Cupid,
an amorous Man; the Vindictive, Revenge; the Hypocrice, Fallhood;
the cancrous Man, Envy; the Innocent, lnnocence; and fuch like.

no Share in some Acts, nor come into play unless they are ufed alone,
and without the Company of living Perfons; as the Elements againt
each other, Virtues againft Vices, and to forth. lis therefore of the
greateff Confequence for a Painter, Staruary, Poet or Orator to Know
thefe Things thoroughly, and keep them in Memory; which Praltice
will make eaty.
I remember, that when I was under my Father's Inftructions, and
Rudying Delign, my Gulto was for Emblems, which I collected from
his and other Mafters Works, and then made intire Compofitions of
them; which, tho' triffing, becaute of my Vouth and Inexperience,
yet furprized many, who advifed my Father to let me purfue that
kind of Study; but whether he thought me too young, or that I ra-
ther inclined to Hiftory, he diverred me from it as much as poffible;
especially fince it drew other Mafters Disciples to fee my odd Producti-
ons; which he much difliked. But when my eldeft Brother brought me
out of Iraly, Cafur Ripr’s Book aforefaid, (which hitherto we were
Strangers to, or elfe was locked up as a Secret) then my Flame for
Emblematic Learning broke out again. By the Help of this Book I
produced many and Rrange Deligns, which, for their Singularity, were
accounted as Prodigies of Dreams, by fome out of Spite againtt me,
others thro' Ignorance; however my Proficiency was fuch, that it
jielded me an annual Profit, becaute the Tefuits Scholars yearly be-

spoke of me the embellithing of above 1go of their Potfions or
Theses, with Emblems, Hiffories or Fables in Watercolours. " Judge
now, whether thefe my Studies tended not tomy Advantage and improve-
ment, and whar Honour was thewed me in preferring me to the imploy,
before my Cotemporaries and Fellow-ditciples, and what lictle Skill
they mut have in heroglyphrical Learning, tho' 1 doubilets then made
many Miltakes.

with Sorrow in a greater or less Degree.
In the lecond Mlanner we thew how Defpair, accompanied by Rage,
is drasging Love to the Grave, with this Inscription,—Didg's Death.
And to I deligned i for the Fronciffiece of Monfieur Pets Tragedy on
that Subject.
Now irs eaty to fee why, in the former Manner, neither Rage,
Despair nor Love attend the Princets; and in the later, why neither
Princels, By-Handers, Alcar nor Pile of Wood are introduced; fince
in the firtt Manner no Aid is wanting, becaute each Figure fufficient
ly acts its own Part, and thews every thing which its Paffion natural
ly leads it to; wherefore it would be redundant, nay obfcure the
Story, to double all the feveral Motions, with the fame Paffions and
Senfes, by thefe Figures; whence it is that they can have no Place.
But where the Subject is purely Emblematic, and Emblematic Figures
the principil Characters, as in the fecond Mianner, they muft come
into play; becaute each Figure then expreffes its natural Quality, in
order to clear and illuftrace the Sente of the Storr, without the Addi
tion of any body elfe.
in this Manner Apelles contrived his Piece, on his being accuted by
Antiftilas; wherein he reprefents innocence purfued by Rage, Vice,
Lies and Slander, and dragg’'d by them before an ignorant Judge;
thus many Things are couched under a fingle Allegory: But when a.
ny pirticuler Perfon, Man or Woman, and their Charalters, Shapes,
Countenances, Cr. are burlefqued in this Manner, then fuch a Delign

may be called a Pasquil.

It is without difpute, that every Man has but one predeminant Past
on at a time. which moves and governs him; wherefore a prudent,
generous and valiant Man, when he is doing a prudent Alt, may be
accompanied by Generofity and Valour, but not with Prudence, becaute
that Quality appears in his Act: Again, if in an Attack he perform a
valorous Action, such mult appear in his Perfon, and Prudence and
Generofity only must accompany him; if: he thew his Generolity, as in re-
Roring Captives without Rantom, Prudence and Valour are sufficient to
attend him, without the Addition of Generesity. The Cafe of a famous
Mafter is the same; for he being pofieffed of feveral good Qualities.
as Judgment, Affiduity, quick Conceptions, Coc. if he be reprefents
ed employed at his Eafel; these Characters may all illuttrace him, ex=
cept Assduity, which thews itfelf by his Motion and Pofture. If a Phir
lolopher do a foolith Thing, all other good Qualities should ornament
him, except Folly, becaute he is committing it.
Such Obfervations as thefe, are worthy of Notice, and without them
an Emblens cannot be good. This Part of the rt is very
Lable to Cen-
hire, but yet few underfland it, becaufe the Falts being
always couch-
ed under uncommon Appearances, are Secrets to the
Vulgar, with-
out Explanation; nevertheless they should be to handled that People of
Judgment at lealt may Know their Meanings, and the Arrift not be re-
proved.
I remember to have feen a Piture of Bocchus and Ariadne, wherein
obferved a Miltake, in placing Sorrow and Defpair about the Princels,
the latter was feen flying from her; which, in my Opinion, was right
and proper in the Mafter; but our Difpute was, whether the Figure of
Sorrow had any Bufiness there. He juftified it by very plautible Rea-
ons, laying, that altho, by the Prefence of the compaffionate God,
her Sorrow was at an end, yet it abaced nor. luddenly; becaute the
Was to give him a Relation of her Difaffer, and then to wait for a
favourable Anfwer; and to long Sorrow mult be with her. I have.
lays he, reprefented her with a forrowful Look; and Tears in her Eyes,
pointing towards the Sea at the perfidious Thesens, the Occation of her
Sorrow; Baccbas is attentive, whofe upper Garment is opened by
Cupid;, and becaute frisdne knew not whom the had with her, Man
or God, Love difcovered his Godhead, and made her fentible of his
Power.
This Piece was, in my Judgment, fine; yer I think Sorrow should
have been left out of the Compofition, becaute, according to our Poli
tion, no Pasfion can aft in two Places at ence; for tho' the Princelss

in the Ufe of hieroglyphic Figures for expresing the Passions, con-
fider, in an especial Manner, whether thofe Paffions work internalty or
externally; I mean, whether the Action and Metion of the Body alfo shew
fofficiently irs predeminant Passion; for a good natured, fedate Man needs
no auxiliary Action to thew he is fuch; becaute his Countenance does it
effectually. But when we defire to make known Love and Sorrow,
which are internal Affections of the Soul, thefe mult be exprefted by
means of Hieroglyphic Figures; and yet if the Body be difturbed and
moved by thole Paffions, the afting Passion may be clearly perceived
without the Help of Hieroglyphies.
Notwichftanding the Necefficy of this Knowledge in all who have
any Relation to Painting, yet many young Statuaries imagine, that
being generally concerned in carving fingle Figures only, it does not
affect them. But they mistake; for suppofe they should be required to
fet off a Figure with Emblems, whether on a Pedefisl, or in a
Niche, in Bats or whole Relief, in order to blazon the Qualities and
Virtues of the Perfon it reprefents, they would be at a sland; and the
rather, as we fee Painters exhibir moft of their Emblematic Figures in
Stone-work, in order to make an Hiffory clear. Now the Statuary,
not able to truff to his own Sirength, relies on the Painters: Aid to
Defign him fuch and tuch Thoughts; to which he fets his Model, and
to proceeds to work.

formaned be the Confequence. : Again, yis prepofterous, that a Prince
should fland in a commanding Potture, at the same Time as. his: Sate
vants are executing his Commands. It would be as unnatural to frame
the Story of the Woman catch’d in Adultery, in this Manner; Cbriff is
writing in the Dull, while the People are fneaking away difcontent-
ed and athamed; and (which is fill worfe) some provided with
Baskets of Stones, either waiting on the fecond Ground for the Iffue,
or departing out of the Temple; tho' our Saviour had not finished
his Writing, by which thole Paltions were to be raifed. The incom-
parable Pouffin poffefted this Condult in an high Degree; as may be
feen in his Picture of this Story. When a General is spiriting his
Army, each Soldier obferves Silence and Attention while the Ha-
rangue is making.
In my juvenile Vears I painted the Story of Progne, where, in Re-
venge of her defloured Sifter Pbifomels, the is thewing and calling at
Terens the Head of his Son, whole Body is almoff eaten up by him;
At which purfuing her in a Rage, the was metamorphifed into a Bird.
reprefented thole outrageous Women shewing him the fevered Head: At
which the King, trantported with Fury, rifes from his Seat, with a
drawn Sword; the Table is overturned, and the drinking Velfels, Difh-
es and other Table furniture lie broken to pieces about the Floor, and
the Wine fpilt at their Feet; and yet I made the Women keep their
Randing, holding the Head. To re-confider this Story, tis natural to
think, that in the Reginaing the Tyrant fat quietly ar the Table, ig-
norant of what was doing; afterwards the Women entered the Room,
thewing him the Childs Head cut off, accended with Speeches proper
to the Occation; which put him firft our of Countenance, and then
piercing his Heart, he furioully arofe from Table and overturned it;
and drawing his Sword in order to purfue them, he puthed down every
thing in his Way: Notwithllanding all which Rage and Difturbance,
the Women remain in the fame Pofture and Station as when they came
in. Vou may ealily perceive my Overight, and improper handling
this Story. Tis true indeed, that all the different Motions were fudden
and quickly fucceffive, yet the kept the Head too long in her Hand, to
throw it on the Table after it was overturned. In all Likelihood, at
the End of her Speech, the mult have thrown down the Head, and
taken to flight as foon as Tereus made the leaft Offer for rifing; and
then muft follow her Metamorpholis, and the be off the Ground. I
conceive therefore, that the Table ought to have been still flanding;
and the, after the Head was thrown upon it, to be flying; and, to

Body, looking up at the Leaves, and feeming to addreisher, who sow
is no more. Another, flanding by, is raifing her Shoulders, dropping
her folded flands, and Head hanging. An old Shepherd is pulling 4-
polle by the Flap of his Coat, but he does not regard it. In fite, no
thing is feen but univerfal Diforder, Sorrow and Wonder; the Gods
and People are flocking from all Parts to view this new Sort of Crea-
ture, to wit, Dryades, Satyrs and Hunting-nympbs, fome with Re
spelt, others with Amazement, others with Joy; the univerfal Mo
ther Earth herfelf Rands in Surprize. To conclude this Fable, I muft
add this Remark, as not foreign to Apollo's Propheey, That the Lan-
rel in Times to come should ferve for a Token of Viltory, and adorf
the Brows of Conquerors inflead of Oak-leaves, and that, in Wic
mory of Daphne, thole should be facred to him above all others.
Here, Valour, or Hercules, appears with his Lion'’s Skin and Club; to
whom Viftory, relling againtt a Laurel tree, is offering a Garland
with one Hand, and pulling off a Branch with the other; in her Arms
is her Trophy.
Memory fits by the aforefaid Tree, on an Eminence, recording, in a
Book, the ctions of the Heroe; Saturn thews her Hercules. On the
second Ground, by a Morats, lies the Body of Hydre, with fome
Heads ftruck off, and others burnt black.

CH AP. XIII. Of Use and Abuse in Painting.
AHIS noble Art having been the Elteem of all Ages, as Writ
ers tellify, his certain, that nothing to pleafingly flatters the
Eye, as a Pilture viewed in irs full Luftre; but in all Things
there is an Use and Abuse, and to it happens in Painting.
The Use lies in handling of noble and edifying Subjects; as fine
Hiflories, and Emblems moral and fpiritual, in a virtuous and decent
Manner; to as at once to delight and infruct. Thus the Art gains its
Lufire.
The Abase appears in treating oblcene and vicious Subjects; which.
ditquiet the Mind and put Modefty to the Bluth: He, who follows
this Method, can never expect the Reward of Virtue (which, Horace
fays, is an immortal Name) but rather eternal Infamy.. We shall confi-
der the Matter in both Respects.

Bot if a Dilcourfe can ths captivace the Heart, how much more
mull the Eye be attracted by a Painting? Since the Sight affects the
Senfes in a greater Degree, especially when the Subject is vicious:
What Honour would a Mafter get by painting the good Man Noab,
wallowing obfcenely in Liquor? And would it be a lets Crime than
Choms mocking him? He did it only to his Brothers; who, turning
away their Faces, covered their Father with their Garments, in order
to hide his Nakedness; whereas the Painter expoles him to all the
World les as indecent to thew Potiphar's Wife, naked on the Bed,
in an unfeemly Polture, inticing Teseph, tho' it was a private Fall,
and not attended with the worll Circumftances. Nor is Michirel Angelo
Buongreti more to be commended, in exhibiting his Leda flark naked,
with the Swan between her Legs; a Circumftance certainly that he might
have omitted Is it not to be lamented, that fince there is fuch a Fund
of Marter for fine Deligns, Virmes as well as Vices. whence we maj
draw good Morals, fober Matters will commit fuch fcandalous Faults,

Doubtlets in every Country, except among Savages, are to be found
good Laws and Manners, and three principal Fimes for dretting, tfee
cially among the Women, whole Actire Worning and Night is plain
and loofe, but at Noon fet out.
Iis no Wonder, that among the Crowd of excellent Mafters, fegr
make Trae Decerum a Maxim in their Works, fince their Opinions 24e
to various, and governed either by their Degree of Skill, or inclinati-
on; one thinks, it lies in the Harmony or Conjnction of Lighss and
Shades; another, in the Compofition of Colours, and thofe ahofether
broken; a chird, in chuling the Colours as beautiful as poffible; and=
ther, in great Force; another, in airy Reffections, Coc. But, fet them
fancy what they pleafe, none of thele Parts will alone confliture a be
coming Picture, hew fimple foever; much less a compleac Ordonnance of
Figures, Landskip, Archicecture, Flowers, Cartle, Edc. For Inflances
of what worth is a Composition of Figures, where all the Pollures and
Airs are alike! Of a Landskip, where, in the Bolcage, we fee no
Difference or Variety in the Bodies of Trees, Leafing or Colouring)
in Archifecture the fame; but how decorous mult a Cartle-piece be,
when we fee the Qualiries of the Animals well expreffed! some fmoashi,
others rough, hairy or woolly. True Decorum then proceeds from
a Conjunction of all the Particulars above mentioned, and a great Force
of Light, Shade and Reffexion, and an Harmony of Colours as well
beautiful as broken, and the whole managed according to Rule, and
agreeing with Nature.
If we will weigh thefe Things, we shalf foon perceive that the
Fault is often our own, and that tis in our Power to arrive at Per-
feltion, if we want not Ambition to excel, and do not undertake
Things above our Capacities. Ultra vires ibil aggrediendum.
Many excellent Mafters have miftaken the Mark; Ars longa, Vira
brevis, fay many; but it is a poor Pretence for an rtift. If it be
true, that you endeavour to gain this Decorum, after your particular
Inclination as soon as possible; be as careful in the lealt as the greatelt
Circumflances, of your Picture; reafon diligently with vourfelf at va=

IL IG EN CE and a proper Talent, in Conjunction with Pru
& deace, may gain Riches; fudden Wealth is not to stable as that
got by degrees; the former is the Effelt of Defire and Luck,
the latter, of Prudence.
I think that Mafter refolves beft, who confiders in the Courfe
of his Study of any Branch.
1. Whether his Fortune and Well-being depend on one particular
Perton, or on the Body of the People.
. 2. Whether it be not more advitable to accommodate himfelf to
the Occafions and Tempers of the People, than to confine himfelf to
his particular inclination.
Laftly, How his Studies may be fometimes enriched with Variety
of new Matter.
He is, 1 far, a prudent Arciff who, weighing thefe, Premifes be
times, as quickly puts them in Execution; elpecially fince the World
is beft pleafed with Variety and Novelty, which fpur them to Love,
Inclination and Defire: What can iubfict without Variety? Is a Cook,
who can dress but one Dith, and one Way, to be compared with him
Who can do feveral?
We have many fad Inflances of excellent Mafters, who, thro' Ob.
finacy, have drudged in Parerty and far down in Want; rather than
go againtt their Cultom; if the Mafter painced Figures, he contin
ed himself to He and She faints; if Landskip, nothing but Wildernef
fes and Deferrs; if Flowers, nothing but Flower-pots; if Seds, no
thing but Storms and Tempelts; if Architecture, nothing but Grottos
and Ruins. Irs true, that Tis more commendable to excef in one
Branch than to be indifferent in many; but as true, that Variety of
Food caufes new Gulto: In short, making a Virtue of Neceffity, we
are obliged to alter our Notions, and fubmit them to Seafons and Oc
cations

The general Fund confifts,

Secondly, in pleafingnew Matter, moving to Love; as the Proverb
fays: Non sufficit unus; wherefore Variety and Novelty are necettary;
but I mean not, that it should appear in every Piece we do; but now ald

then, occafionally, in order to pleafe and retain the Curious.

Laftly, Ir mult be confidered, whether there can be found such a
conflant Flow of Novelty, as the parricular Study of the Arcift calls
for, and wherein it confifts; some principal Inflances of which, from
whence may be deduced an infinity, I shall here fubjoin; as, foff
the Figare painter, there are not only He and She faints, but allo Phi-
lolophers, Prophets and Propheteffes or Sybils, eminent Men and Wa-
men as well in Policy as Warfare, Monarchs, Law-givers, Statelmen,
and Ecclefiafties; the four Parts of the World; the five Senfes; and
innumerable other remarkable Perfons and Objects: Judge then, whe
ther there be not Matter enough for thofe who would go greater
Lengths than to spend Vears, nay, their whole Lives, in fingle Figures.
in Landskip what a Field is there for Variety, belides Wilderneffes and.
Deferts? as, delightful Lawns, beautiful inclofures, Rivers and Cat
cades, Rocks and Caves, Pyramids, Burying-places and Tombs, and
Places of publick Exercife; Plantations of Trees, Country-houfes,
Sports of Shepherds; Sacrifices and Bacchanalia; and all thefe varied by
being made Fronting, in Profile or in Rear, fometimes with an high, at
others a low Horizon; fometimes in Sun-thine, at others in Moonlight;
to Which add, Bealts, Birds, Csc. For Sea-painters, remarkable Ac-

of the Branches affords greater Variety than Archireffure; as well in

ment, what an Abundance of beautiful Temples; Palaces, Fronrif

and other ornamental Stone; to which add, the great Diverlity arifing
from the Ornaments of Gold, Silver and Marble, Bassreliefs, Paint
Jngs, Hangings, Alcoves, Pavillions, Cabinets; in fine, nothing can
be imagined, that the Painrer of Architelture cannot make his own:
Andthe proper Defigas in Painting may be, Solomon praying for Wif
dom; the Queen of Sacbs with Sofomon; the Nuptials of Tofeph and
Mary; Crrif among the Pharifees; Mark Anthony and Cleepatra;
the Murther of Tulas Cafar; Solon with Crasus; the Goddels Veffa
appearing before the Entrance of the Puntbeon, to curb the infolent Ar-
tempe of the Peoble to violare her; Herse and other Virgins going to
the Temple of Flers, and Mercury, in love, hovering follows her;
Mfercary and Herse in her Bed-chamber, Coc. Other inward and out
ward Decorations may be Sacrifices in Temples, Court-ffories, and Oc-
cufrences in Palaces, Halls and Apartments (fome of which we have
elfewhere thewn) befides Confules, grand Encertainments, Plays, Vifits,
Wiccheraff, Gholls, delightful Appearances, Coc. As to the Flower
painter, what can be more pleafant and agreeable than Flowers in their
great Varicty, beautiful Air and Colour? A Sight which never fires,
tho' but in Painting: I confine them not to a lingle Flower-pot; for
they may be varioutly ditpoted; wreathed as Garlands; or made into
Feftoons and Groups; or loofe in Baskets; fometimes intermixed with
Grapes, Apricocks, Peaches, Cherries, Grains of Paradife, Cor. accord
ing to the Seafons; which may be expreft by Bults of Copper and all
Sorts of Marble, and by Balsreliefs; befides the five Senfes: Add,
for Variety, notable Leating, as Laurel, Cypress, Oak; and fometimes
to the Fruit, Corn, Turmps, Carrots, Pumkins, Melons, Walnuts,
Figs, COc. Proper Defigns for this Branch may be thefe; for the
Spring, Venas and Adoms in Courrship, fet off with Children and
Flowers; for the Summer, Pomons and Ffora, with Flowers and Fruit;
for Aurumn, Pomens and Vertumnas, in a Summerhoule.
I think it needlets to defcend lower, fince there is no subject, how

Product of my weak Abilicies would not give Offence, I purfued my
preations, imperfect as they are, I shall be ar lealf pleated, if my En.

Iis agreed, that a Table or Ordonnance is a Reprefentation of fome
Fall, either with the Pen or Pencil. A Poem is a fhort and plain Ac
count of the moft material Circumftances; fhewing the true Caute from
wheme the Falt proceeds.
Three Qualiries are necelfary to a good Poet. 1. An exalt Ac
quaintance with Hiffory, and the beft Authors. 1. Good Knowledge
in Antiquities Laftly, an eafy and delicate Poety; to which add,
an agreeable Stile, by which, after having weighed what Materials
and Paffions are proper, he dispofes every thing in a consecutive Order,
and the moft perfpicuous Manner.
Grace is as neceffary in Poety as Harmony of Colours in a Painting;
but tho' all the aforefaid beautiful Qnalicies be well obferved, yet they
camiot produce a perfell Ordonnance without the Aid of the Rules of
Painting: For a fine Hiffory of great Perfonages, accompanied with e.
legant Byornaments, in a delightful Country, unartfully dispoted, is
to far from Perfection, that it cannot have the wimofl Grace, tho' it
were the Life irfelf. Much may be faid for a Subject well treated;
but more for an Ordonnance of a skilful Mafter, painted according to
the Laws of Art, which make even Crookednets feem firait.

The third has a threefold Moral; teaching our Duty to God, our Neigh-
bour and ourfelves: And the laft is fourfold, as couching, under a
Thort and myfterious Senfe, the three before going; handling Virtue and
Vice for the Benefit of Soul and Body, and thewing the Happinels and
Immortality of the one, and the Corruption of the other.
In Hiffory, the Poet or Painter, ought intirely to confine himself to
Tratb, without Addition or Abatement; his Ornaments, tho' borrow.
ed from Poety, mult be fo reftrained, that nothing, ferving for II-
inttration, create Improbability; for Inflance, not to reprefent Day-
break by the poetic Figure of Aurera; or the Night, by Dians; or
the Sea, by Neprane; which is needlefs, and an Error, becaute thofe
Things can be naturally expreffed by Colours; as Day-break, by its
Appearance, of Vellow, Red and Blue, or by the Sunrays appearing on
the Horizon; the Night, by irs Darkness, and by the Moon and
Stars; the Sea by its Waves and Billows, Rocks, Montters and Shells
on the Shore; allo the Nile, by it's Crocodiles, Coc. or any Thing
proper to the Sea or Rivers.
The Poetic Tables differ from the hifforical in this; that, inflead of
true Story, they confider Fictions only, intermixing Deities with Mor-
tals, as we have faid; and thereby fignifying nothing elfe, but the
Courfe of the Wolld hme the four Elements, as Air, Earth, Fire and
Water; and tho' hifforically handled, yet each is a fimple Figure, hav-
ing a myftic Meaning, either in Name or Shope, and often in both;
25 Scylla, Atlas, Ledu, Cyclops, and many others. And thus the Fable,
being both philofophic and moral, in one and the iame Manner pre-
fcribes Virtue and decries Vice; as we gather from Ovid, Virgil, and o-
thers. It is necelfary therefore, in deligning fuch an Ordonnance, to
keep intirely to the Fable, as before is laid, without any Addirion of
hicroglyphic Figures, as Temperance, Prudence, nger, Jealouty
COo. which are fo improper here, as hereafter shall be thewn, that they
deftroy the very Incent of it; for there are others, which (tho' in a dit-
ferent Manner) willexpretsthe fame Paffions; as Cupid, inflead of Love;
Pallas, inflead of Wifdem, and many others; as we collect from the
POets.
The Moral Ordonnances are true Falts, or Hfifferies, propoled only for
Edification or Inttruction; exhibicing either the gallant Alts, or Crimes,
of human Nature; and thefe explained by fome additional emblematic
Figures, which express the Paffions by which they were moved, or
milled; for inflance, with Alexander we may place Ambition; next

In this Sort of Ordonnances we are no ways confined to Time, the
Sun’s Place, or the Qualiry of the Country; for we may intermix Sum-
mer with Winter, even all the Elements may appear; the Subject may

a Lacitude has a Moralift: But he mult take Care to avoid Superffuity,
and Things improper to the man Action, which, as in Plays, fpoil the
Beauty of the Repretentation.
The Hicreohpbic Ordonnances are quite different from the three for-
mer in their Nature and Quality, having no other Affinity with them
chan an imention to exalt Firtue, and debase Vice, by the Rewards of the
one and the Punishment of the other They are as well Chriftian 2s
Heathen; the Chrillian affect the Soul, and the Heathen the Body:
The former Gemonttrate the Immortality of the Soul, and the latter
thew the Vicifficude and Vanicy of the World. Thele Tables canfiff in
affembling feveral emblematic Figures of different Paffions, which all
together are to express a fingle Meaning; as Piety, Peace, War, Love,
Csr. And fuch Tables are called Emblems, by their Application and

Objects which

caufe, havingneither Hiffory nor Fable to build en, taey confift only of
a fingle Paltion, proceeding from the Subject (which may be at our own

Being well apprized of thefe Things, we obtain the bell and fureff
Method for deligning any kinds of Tables, of Ordonnances, how ab.

plentiful Marter to furnith out and earich a large and capital Compo-

the Greek Philolopher Eschylas, that, as he fat meditating in the Field,
he was killed by a fortoife dropp’d by an Eagle on his bald Pate; which
mournful Accident I handle thus. A lirtle to the left from the Point of
Sight, I place the unforcunate old Man, on a small Eminence, with a
Pen in his Hland, and a Book in his Lap; he is fallen on his right
Thigh (which is forethortened) with his Legs across, and one of them
extended to the left, his upper Parts bending, and inclining fomewhat
to the right; his Head is in Protile and downwards; he flings his right

under him) hovers the Eagle, looking downwards; at the Corner of 4
Stone, (fix inches high, and covered with a Part of the aforefaid Gar-
ment) running towards the Point of Sight, is an inkhorn, and some roll-
ed Papers, and his Cap. This is the Subllance of the Compofition:
In the Offskip, where the Ground to the right lies low, I thew a Pyra-
mid, and near it a Shepherdels fitting by a young Shepherd, who is
Randing, and offers her a Bowl of Water, or Milk; up and down are
Cattle grazing, and nearer (behind the fore Ground) it would not be

wher's Cry, does, in Surprize, look back at him, fwaying the upper
Part of his Body (which is almoft naked to the Walle) to the left.
The Philofopher is plainly dreft in a long Veflment, and a Flappet of
his upper Garment, whereon he fat, comes under his right Thigh;
the Vellment is dark Violet, and the Garment light Fillemot; the
Stone, whereon the Garment lies, is blucith; the Ground Gratsgreeny
the Paffenger, behind the fore Ground, is in Shade, except his Head,
and part of his Shoulders; and is drell in a reddith Skin, a Cap on his

Some perhaps may ask, why Pre chosen but a fingle Figure for the
Subject of this Ordonnance; my Reafon is, to thew thofe who are
skill’d in Landskip a Method of giving their By-ornaments greater
Luftre, and Excellence; thofe, I mean, who are fo rich in Invention
of inanimate Objects, that they are content with one Figure, and at
moft two, and thofe perhaps of little Significancy; tho' it mult be
granted, that the Name of an excellent, wife and celebrated Perfon,
reprefented in an artful Landskip, gives the Work a Lullre, and the
Mafter Reputation; for a skilful Landskip-painter certainly deferves
Honour, but double when he thews that he alfo underllands Hiftory
and Poetry.
Many Landskip painters (not excepting some famous Ialians) chule
commonly low, mean and poor Subjects, and By-ornaments; for my
part, I generally leften my Landship, to give room for Embellifhment.
In fine, if we cannot be alike perfect in all things, we may at leaft,

of another Mafter, adorned with elegant By-works, and fine Colour-
ing, to be a flavith imitator of it, by incroducing neither more nor
leis Figures, nor other Draperies and Colours? What Reputation is
got by it, were it ever fo well executed; nay, if differenly difpoled
and incomparably painted! Iis certain, that something mere is necelfary
before we undertake a Subject. A prudent General will not rely on
the Report of one Spy; nor (pare either Men, Money or Pains to get
right intelligence of the Enemies Deligns; a good Painter should do
the fame, in order to excel; which to do, the following Obfervations
are highly necelfary.
1. We mult know how the Story, we pirch on, is defcribed by the
Author; and confider, whether we agree in every Circumftance with
his Opinion.
2. We muit confult the Comments of the beft Writers on that Sub-
jell, in order to get the true Meaning of the Story.
3. We mult weigh the fuiting and Application of the Draperies,
and their proper Colours and By-ornaments.
4. How the four Elements, the four Complexions, and the four
Hours of the Day, with their Form, Ornaments and Colours ought
to be reprefented.
Thus we may obtain Truth, and the Mafter will make it appear
whether he has gone to the Bottom of Things.
Few Painters excel in Hiftory, especially Fables, for want of Incli-
nation to enquire thoroughly into their Subject; Reading, they think, is.

and the ofber, a Flower-pot; why then should not these be my Patterns,
ince they cone fron such great Maffers? I readily grant, that Books of
Prints are of great Ule to Painters; but to ule them in this Manner
is a willing Clavery, unlets we cannot read.
In my Touth I was to converfant with even the leaft of Ovids Fa.
bles, that on hearing but the Name of one of them, I could repeat
the whole Circumftances of the Story; but their Meanings and Ules
(which shall be our prefent inquiry) my Father had never told me;
ill long after, led by Curiofire, I re-confidered them; and with the
Affiltance of my Brother Jumes (who was Mafter of the Greek)
was led into fome of the myfferious Meanings which they con-
tained.
Many have a fuperticial Knowledge of Ocrd's Fables, but few un

nothing from the Text; wherefore we shall now explain ourfelves in

The Fuble of APOLLo and HYACINTHUs.
Ovid relates, that Spollo was in love with this Vouth for his ex
traordinary Shape and Beaury; and that, as they were playing at Coins
together, the Vouth was unhappily ftruck with one of them, which
occafioned his immediate Death.

to gain the Vouth's Elleem, at length, thro' Rage, gave into Despair,

Explanation of the Fuble.
Hiacineras, who, according t. te Poets, was metamorpholed by
Apollo into a Flower of that Name, is a true Emblem of Wifdom;
for Apollo preliding over the Mufes and Learning, Hyscinthus is repre-
fented to us as a Fouth beloved by him for his Beauty, having his natu
ral Faculries as ver uncorrupted, as being a Child without Judgment or
Difcretion, jet beeiful; exalting his Mind, in order to contemplate
himself. Ithence we learn, that when the Senfes fortake the Follies
of Touth, they bring forth the Flower of Wifdom, adorned with
Virtue, whole immortaliry is, by Writers, facred to all Ages.

The Poets differ in their Relations of this Fable of Dians and En=
dymion, but moftly agree in the Explanation of it, as I shall now thew:
They fay, that the Afoon, (Diang) falling in love with the Sheoherd
Endymion, fiung him into an everlafting Sleep, on a Mount in Caris;
named Latosie, that the might Kifs him at pleafure; but others report
otherwife. Punfanies intimates, that they went further than Kiffing,
and that Endymion begot go Daughters on the Moon. Others affirm,
that the yielded to his Pleafure, on Condition he made her a Prefent of
some white Sheep: Tho' all be fabulous, yet it carries some Probabi-
lity; for Pausumas concludes, that Endymion was the firft who obferv-
ed the Phafes and Courfe of the Moon. Pliny alfo reflifies, that Endy.
mion firft obferved the Motions of the Moon, and learned her Narure
and Qualities; which gave Rife to the Fable, that the fell in love with
him. Alexander Apbrodifius likewile writes, in his Emblems, that
Endysion had great Skill in Aftronomy, and, becaute he flept by
Day, to fit himself for Night obfervations, it was teigned, that he had
carnal Knowledge of her, and alfo a wenderful Dream, by which,
being a Philolopher, he got that Knowledge: Others fay, that he was
a poor Shepherd, (as Seneca, in his Tragedy of Huppolifus) tho' a King's
Son, and that he dwelt on Mountains and in Colitary Places, the better
to observe the Moon's Motions. The learned F. Gattrucharthus has

is, that Endymion obferved nicely the Moon's Motions; and therefore

the Story, the Parts and Ordonnances whereof follow.
Tible, or Ordennance, of DIANA and ENDYMION.
Ethlius
Endimion, Son of 14 King of Elis, a beautiful and well-haped
Vouth, is lying afleep on his upper Garment, on a near Mount, on the
right side of the Picture; under his Arm is a Tacob’s Staff, a Crook
near him, and at his Feet a large Celeflial Sphere, and some Books
and Papers, whereon appear Charalters and Diagrams. He is in Profile,
his upper Parts fomewhar raifed, and he leans, with his left Ear a little
forward, on his left Hand; his right Leg is extended, and the left lifi
ed up; he is all in the Shade of the Trees, except his right Leg and
half that Thigh, and receives frong Reffexions from the Woon. Di
one, a little off, (not in her Hunting Habic, or fitting by him and Kiffing
him, with the half Moon on her Hlead, as ufually reprefented) naked
defcends from the Clouds, with a full Moon behind her as big as
herfelf, and furrounded with Stars, with the Attendance of Love, (or
Capid) the is in a fronting Poficion, bending a litde forward, with
her left Knee on a low Cloud; her Arms wide open, as if about to
embrace the Vouth; and in her lefr Hand is a & Siprum; her Aspect
is beautiful and gay, and full of Defire, being lighted by a Sun-fet as
well as Cugid, who is defcending with her on her right side, with his
Face towards her, and holding, in his right Hand behind him, his
Bow downwards, and in his left, (which comes forwards) an Arrow,
with which he points at the feeping Vouth; he ffies fomewhat oblique

Thigh, which is fomewhat forethortened. Below this Child, on the
left side, where the Mount declines, fit two other Children joining and
blowing their Torches; and behind them appears the Offskip, being a
Valley with a low Horizon. The Sphere, Books and Papers lying to
the left at Endymions Feet, are (with a fmall Part of the Mount
which comes forwards) in the Light; the Vouth's Garment (of which
a Part covers his Privities) is Purple; that of the Goddets, Sky-colour.
The Sun is low, proceeding from the right.
Explanation of the Fable.
By Endymion we may underfland a virtuous Mind, which the hea-
venly Spirits endeavour to carels and Kils through Violence of Af-
fection.
The high Mount implies, that when the Soul afcends to Heaven,
the Body is feized with heavy Sleep or Death; for fince the Body hin-
ders a perfect Union with God, it follows, that as foon as the Soul
has dilengaged itfelf, it goes eafily and quierly to Heaven.
Diand, by her increale and Decreafe, reprefents the Changeablenets
of Things; for the Greek Poets afferted, that Tupiter, feeing Diana go
naked and indecently for a Virgin, charged Mercury to make her a
Garment, and that, tho' he made her feveral, yet none would fit, becaute
her Shape was always changing; wherefore her Figure is a natural
Emblem of Increafe and Decreafe, and of the Mutabilicy of worldly
Things. This Figure has alfo other neceffary Ufes, with respect to
human Life; as St. Ambrose intimates, who, from the Example of the
Moon, (whole Light is variable, always increafing or decreating)
reaches, that nothing in the World is ftable, but all Things subject to
Decay.
The Siffrum in Diana's Hand (the Ufe of which lies in the Motion)
allo denotes the Vicifficude of worldly Things, and their continual
Destruction and Renovation. Others think, that the Siffrum fignifies,
the Sound, which the Moon caufes in the Courfe of the Heavens.
in fuch a Manner as this, should all Hiffories, Fables and Fictions
be examined, if the Artifl aim at Reputation. I think, I have given
the Curious Satisfaction enough in two Examples; for should I
go further, the Subject would not only be trefome, but fwell
as big as the whole Work; wherefore, for Variety, we shall pass to

CHAP. XVIl. Rules for the Management of small Figures in a
lirge Compass; and the contrary.
HE R Es a great Difference between the Ingenuity of a good
Painter, and that of a mere Deligner, with reiped to Or-
donnance; the former proceeds by the eftablished Rules of Art,
the latter only aims at what is Defigner like; the one is Mafter of
Principles and Rules, the other is ignorant of both; the Deligner con-
fidersonly what relates to Relief (being a Stranger to the Natures and
Effects of Stutts, Colours and Tints) and therefore he mult find all
Things by means of Lights and Shades only But a Painter has more
Liberry and Advantage; becaufe he can, belides the Shades, effeet eve
y thing by his Colours and Tints But the Difference is further vi
ble from the Sets of Prints daily publithed, whether in Lapdskip,
Perfpeltive Views, Architelture, C:. or anrent or modern Story;
in all which, the Deligner generally travels the old Road of Compoli-
ions, and the Ercher or Engraver as clofely follows him; but when
2 good Painter handles them, all the Parts will be improved and be
come more excellent, as well the invention, Difpofition and Harmony,
as even the Motions; by which Means, a Perfon of fmall Abilities
cannot but be better pleafed, and often, for the fake of one or two
fine Prints, buy a whole Set; as in Ouduens Book of the Romin
Night, in which, one Plate, engrav’d by Abrabam Bloteling, does, by
it's Nearnets and Elegance, eclipfe all the reft; and this is the more
remarkable, becaute in his Medals the Figures are shaded not with
Hatching, but with a thick Stroke and Touch on the hady Side.
Now, agreeable to the Tirle of the Chapter, we thall pass to the
necellary Management of an Ordonnance with large Figures in a fmall
Compals It mult be granted, that an Ordonnance in a large Extent,
requires more Circumitances than a fmaller, altho’ in either, the chief
Marcer lie ber in three or four Fgures; for what in the former comes
clofe and filling, mut in the larter be ppread, in order to till up a
large Space; and to do this artfully, we are obliged to introduce other
By-works, and thote (tho' inlignilicant, yet probable, and not. repug
nant to the Subject) tending to explain the Story; for inftance, in a
Landship, to introduce fome Buildings, Fountains, Pyramids of Sta

Batsreliefs, and fuch like, either for Ornament, of to make larger
Crouping; in thort, any thing that will entertain the Eye, fince jmoll
Figures, in a large Compass, are not of themselves cupable of doing it:
Wherefore, with respect to fuch, the By-ornaments ought to be large,
in order to create broad Lights; yet thefe Ornaments mult not be to
mondrous as some have them, who, in order to rell the Compofiti
on, make Pillars bigger than three of the Figures can fathom, with
Caftle-like Capitals, and frizal Figures almoft in full Proportion; nor
to out of the way as thofe, where, in a Landskip, are feen Trees 3 or
400 Feet high; Termes, mere Coloffules, and Pyramids higher than
any in the World; to which add, Houfes in the Offskip, where, be-
fore People can poftibly approach them, they muft be loft by Diflance.
But this is egregious Condult; for we should always bring together
tuch Parts or Objects as neither leffen the Figures, or cause any Obfiructi-
on in the Composition; 1 meas, that a large Compats mult either look
large, or elle be filled and adorned in a moderate Manner, as we shall
thew in two Sketches of the mourning Vous, Plate XVill. each repre
fented in a different Mianner, to demonfirate, that in a large Compass a
great Mass of Light is absolutely neceffury. The Story is, Venus incon-
foleable for the Deach of her dear Adonis; even the Aid of Cupid
fails, whole Bow, rrews and extinguished Torch, nay her beloved
Garland of Rofes, the tramples under Foot; Murs, tho' fetretly-pleaf-
ed at the Adventure, however pretends to tympathize with her im her
Sorrew, but in wain; for the flighis his Offers, and puthes him: frown
her; the refts on the Tomb of her Lover, wherein erther his Body. is
depoficed, or (according to the Curlom of the Country) his Athes are
kept in the Trn; the other By-work is a Grove of Cypress and Myr.
les; from the Urn, might prosced a Sprig of the Flower which is ad
1
tcribed to him; fince it owes its Origin to his Blood.
.
On a dae Compariton of the Plates, we miy difcover the Difference
between the two Compofitions; in the uppermoft the Mass of Light
is neither to large, or pread as in the undermoft; which proves, that
in a great and clofe Oxdonnance in a lmall Compats (as the upper) fixt.
a great Riats of Light is not neceffary, much lets By-works, infordey
to encreafe it; becaute the Figures there principally govern; and Her
ing large, have on that Occalion, the greateft Forez, as well in the
Execution, as Beauty and Colouring; the By-works ferving to thew the
Place and Occafion, but not to draw the Eye: Whence, is cafy to fee,
that whaticreates Decorum and Elegance in the one, appears infignifi-
cant and difagreeable in the other; 1 speak of the Ligtt ont, which
requirs

requires a diiint Management in both; wherefore, fince in a large
Compats, the Br-ornaments make the greateff Part, they muft con
sequently caule greater Maffes of Light there; and contrarily, in a
imall Compats, where the By-works are leaft, the main Light ought
to take the Figures only. And to confirm this, I mult fay, that what
in the undermoll Repretentation pleafes the Eye, and fets off the Com-
polition (even were it as large again) is only cauted by the Light, be
caute the By-works, being the moll, abace the Light of the Figures;
wnich having in the upper, with the dark Tomb, more Force,
muff create fuch a Confution as to weaken the Strength of the prin-
cipal Figures. in a Word, the larger the Figures, the more Shade
ouget to be about them; and of Consequence, the smaller the Figures, the

RE we end this Book, or leave this Subject, tis proper to con-
II fider further, whether it be not more artful to reprelent a Story
natural and clofe in a fnall Compats than a larger; which I think
to prove from the Examples of Raphael, Caracci, Dominichine, Pouf
pa, Le Brun, and other excellent Mafters. Moreover daily Experience
confirms it. les cerrainly troublesome to be confined to a fmall Com-
pats, especially to thofe who affelt to load their Compoficions, becaute
Largenets is very entertaining to the Thoughts: the Difference between
both Managements is the fame as painting as big as the Life and in
Lirtle, where we fee that in the former lies the moft Art, fince we can
more eaily go from the large to the fmall, than contrary, tho' both
be done from the Life. The Cafe of thefe two Arcifts is like that of
a skilful Steerfman, who, capable of wreftling with Storms and Dan-
gers, fails unconcernedly in imooth Rivers; when a meer Ferry-man
would be pur to his Shifts to fteer on the Occan: He then is happiell,
who has been always uted to large things, fince the small spring from
them like an inlend River, which lofes its Strength the further it goes
from its Spring; of which the old Mafters were not infentible, who,
tho' much employ’d in small Painting, yer lay in for large Work, be
ing confcious, that what required the moff Trouble and Skill, got them
the greater Name and Profit.
The

The Force of a large Painting beyond a small one, and its Advan-
tages are thele:
1. The Natural Reprefentation has a better Effect; for viewing it
near, it raifes Love, Pity, Anger or any other Paftion, as if we lym-
pathized with the Story.
2. It raifes the Mafter's Fame.
Laftly, The Work is much effcemed.
Itwere needlets to mention other Advantages; wherefore Ishall confirm
my Opinion by Examples. We read of a Picture of Stratenica, that
the Sailors in a Storm took it for a Deity, and accordingly worlhipp’d
it. And that in June's Temple, her flanding Figure was to artfully
painted, that her Eyes feemed to look every Way, and at any Be-
holder wherever he placed himfelf, appearing fevere to the Criminal,
and gentle to the Innocent. The Reaton of which Effelts is, that the
two Pictures were fo highly finished, and had fo natural an human
Shape, that they feemed to be rather Fleth and Blood, and to have
Motion, than to be Paintings.
This thews what inffuence large Reprefentations have on the Senfes;
let us now fee what Paffions Currofty raifes, as in this Example; 1 fup-
pose a murther’d Corps lying fomewhere; near it a Perfon weeping; a
little further, the Seizure of the Murtherer; and the People running
some towards him, others towards the Body. Now it may be asked,
whether all thefe Circumftances do not fufficiently thew the Fact,
without other Perfons, or greater Paffions: To which, I antwer nega
tively; for we ought to fee whether the wounded Perfon be dead, or
not, and in what Part wounded; next, whether 1 know the Affaffin;
whether the Woman lamenting him be of Quality, or ordinary, and
whether the be related to the wounded Perion; accordingly coming
nearer, I think I know him; I am affrighted; I behold the Wound,
which appears ghaftly to me, and am the more affected by the Tears
of the troubled Woman, who flands at his Head; Ilook for the Mur-
therer with Concern and Revenge, and fee him dragg’d in lrons between
two Officers; he looks pale, and his Heart forebodes the worl; in
fine, every one is varioully affelted, some concerned, others indiffe-
rent with respect to the Fate of the wounded, or Murtherer. Now,
if such a Variety of Objects occur in a fimple Accident, what Force
mult the Life have, when feen near in fuch a Reprefentation, especial-
ly if naturally expreft? But we need not wonder, that fo few tread in
that old Path, fince they feck Eale, and want the Ambition to excel
by an exact Inquiry into Nature.

Ionce thought I got Reputation by painting in little, but was af
terwards convinced that large Work, or the Life feen near, was the
turelt Way to Excellence; but Envy and Strife fopp’d my Career.
Ihat the Painters in large in thefe Countries merit, may be eafily
determined, fince few of them do it mafterly, thro' Ignorance of the
true antque or beautiful Life; by true Antique I underfland, perfect
Anfiquity without Mixture of modern Mode; not Venus with Stays,
Mlars in a Suit of Armour, Pallas in a Straw-hat, Cc. which is a
Choice that can never get Reputation; becaute frch a Mafter has
no thorough Knowledge of the Life, nor brings Work enough into
his Ordonnances. If he get a bold and light Pencil, thats thought
fufficient; his Drawings are commonly to flight, that they difcover lir.
tle more Light than whar is necelfary for the moft relieved Parts,

witkour Reoard to half Tints, tender Parts and foff mufcling; and
from thefe Drawings he paints as big as the Life; whereby he is ob-
liged to fupply, as he can, all the other Requifices which in the Life he
fighted; thus the Compofition comes out lame, and what makes it
worfe, his Averfion to Draperies, and beautiful Fefds, which are to
gracefiul in a Picture, and to eafily to be had from the Life. But Dra-
peries, fays he, are Triffes; as they fall out, let em pass; if tis not
Linnen it may ferve for Woollen; and if for neither, tis at leaff
Draperr.
Bur when, on the contrary, I view the old Maffers Works, what a
rall Difference do I not difcover! What Pains have they fpared to han
dle their Subjects properly! Tis true, they admitted not of many
Circumftances in their Compofitions, but, what they did, were perfelt
ir artful, elegant and natural. View but Caracer's Weman by the Well;
Rapharls Simon Magus; Dominichine's Tudith, Tiba, Esther and
Ducid; Poufins Ember and Abasuerus; or Le Bruns beautiful Death
of St. Stegben; how wonderful, expreffive, noble, natural and clofe they
are ordered, and that with large Figures. All which plainly proves,
that painting as big as the Life is much preferable to that in Ltile, and
char he, who has made the former his Praftice, can eafily perform
the latter, tho' he in Little cannot to eafily give into the large. To
have a fine and narural Exprestion in Little is certainly commendable;
but Tis more ealy to mark out a Camp, and draw up an Army for
Barrle in a large Plain than in a narrow Compats; a pread Army is
weak, but Cloteness of Troops makes it frong; wherefore in hnarrow
and ill firuared Places, a General muft thew his urmoft Conduel. We

Mutick the fame, perfelt Harmony lying in four Parts, whether vo
cal or inftrumental; us likewife more artful, to compofe a Piece in few
than many Divifions.
Charles da Gardin was exceeding fine in Little, and yet he had a
great Inclination to imitate the large Manner; but he did not fucceed.
Alseris, the famous Painter in Little, loff all his Credir with his Parron
the Duke of Tuscany, by his Pourtraits in full Proportion; and to it
has happened to others. Thole who practife in Little, ule small Pup-
pets for their Layman, but not Pupper-dreffes; their Academy-figures
are drawn on whice Paper, uncertainly fhaded without Mezzo-tint or
Tendernels, and no higher finithed than ferves their Turn: Othiers,
who fancy they Know better, and, as if they had a Notion of broad
Management, Charpen the Extremities of their Figures and darken a
little againtt the Light, having no need of a second Tint; becaute their
Figures shall not round. Once, as I was drawing at the Academy, I
met with a Perfon who managed in that Manner, and 1 defired he
might be, asked (becaute then 1 underffood not the Language of the
Country) why he did not finith his Figures better, fince he had Time
ehough for it? Whofe Anfwer was, he had no Occafion for more Fin th
ing, as painting fmall Things, one, two or three Foot high at fur-
thelt I then cauted him to be asked, that fuppoling he were to do
tomething larger, whether he would not be at a lols! He antwered; that
he hoped he should not, as long as he kept to his Text: Which indeed
was Truth, as appeared in the Confequence; for having an Opportu-
nity afterwards to paint fome Figures in full Proportion, there was no
more in them than in his Drawings, which were his Models. More
Inftances of this Kind were fuperfluous, fince tis hoped the better Ad.
vifed will conduct their Studies righly in a due Examination of the
Life, in order to qualify themfelves for larger Things.
This Obfervation touching (mall and large Compals, is not only ufe-
ful in Hiffory, but alfo in Landskip, Pourtraiture, Flowers, Fruir,
Shipping, Architecture; in fine, in all Parts of Painting.

Confent; and why. He, who thinks himself to do as he pleafes, may
indeed paint Tapiter with a Fools Cap, and a yellow or green Garment;
and Momas in a purple Drapery, and to forth; becaufe theres no other
Punithment for him but his ignorance: But a well advifed Artiff will
make better Inquiries, that he may jultify his Work, or that the
Work may peak for irfelf. Let us love Vertue, Jays Horace, for
the fake of Vertue, and thun Vice, not only for fear of Punithment,
but allo for the Odium it carries. ltho' no one need fear corporal
Punishment for diforderly Manasement of Hiffory, yet he is not free
from the Reproach of lon
and Blunder, a Punishment great e
nough to a generous Mind; wherefore we should fubmit to eftablished
Order, as the Conduftor of our Studies, the fureff Way being bett,
and the bearen Road neareft. If a good Hifforiographer, in compiling
2 Story, make an orderly Divifion of his Materials, ere he begin to
write; dispoting firft the general Heads, and then the particular ones;
afterwards, the incidents, and which of them are principal, and how
many; and which of them happened Without, and which Within
doors; moreover contidering, whether the Story throughout is to be
handled in all iis Circumftanses in a certain Number of Parts, or in
some principalones only ; as whether he will contract Hemer's 24 Books
into 12, Virgifs 12 into 6, or Orids 1g. into 7 or 8, at pleafure; to a
judicious Painter, in handling a magnificent Hiffory, should make him-
felf Mafter of the true Concents and Meaning of it; as whether the
Parts be few or mant; if many, whether he cannot bring them into
a fmall Compers; and if few, whether he cannot add to them: More-
over he is to conider, which are the principal Parts, and what can be
left out, in order to reduce them to fuch a proper Number as will an
fiver his Purpote; always remembring, in cafe he should fall thore,
that he may ule any Licence that is not againtt Nature and Reaton, even
to make two incidents out of one, when Occafion requires.
We are therefore to eltablith it for a general Method, in handling a
thorough Hillory, divided into 3, 4 or g Ordonnances, more or lets,
that the firtt Picture mult always thew the Drifc, srate and Place of Alli-
an; and the lait, the Conclution of the whole Story.
Large Hillories, fuch as of Tofeph, Alexander Hercules, and others,
which belt become Palaces, Saloons, Apartments and Galleries, can
not be handled in a tingle Piece, becaute of the Variety of Accidents
they contain, which muit be concinued in feveral Fictures, whether in
Tapeftry or Painting. Again, if the Gods come in Play (which fre
quencly happens) the Cieling is proper for them; taking Care, that e

ther the Beginning or Conclution of the Story be over the Chimmney,
as I shall more largely thew in the Book of Cieling- painting.
There are many fuch long Stories in Homer, Virgil, Apuleins, Tafe,
even in Scripture itfelf: Now if we would chule two lncidents out of
any of them, or make two Compofitions, and thofe to be hang'd to
gether, we ought in the firft to reprefent the moft remarkable Part,
whether it be the 1ft, 2d, 7d, 4th or gth Accident, according as it
happens, to that its Fellow may be the laft; as the End of Adonis,
or his Death; the Fall of Phacton, or his Grave; Sardunapalus burn-
ing himself; Encars Deification; x Is Dilinghantment; and, in
facred Story, Solomons offering to the Idotr Rinaldo
Here tis neceffary to be oblerved, that all Hiffories have two con-
trary Beginnings and Conclutions; fome, a forrowful Beginning and a
joyful Exit; others, contrary; to which add a third, which are neither
joyful nor forrowful. The Story being divided into three Accidents,
the firft should lerve as an incroduction to what we intend to treat of;
in the second should appear the main Action; and the third should turn
in the happy or miferable Event: For Inttance; we may reprefent fis
has Cafar eatring on the Government; next, his Condition, or fur-
ther Promotion; laftly, his Death. We can allo divide a Story into
four Parts or Stages, as the Birth, Rife, Life and Death of a vulgar
of noble Perfon.
But five Divisions are the most perfelt; more are fuperfluous; becaute
any Hiffory may be fufficiently reprefented in five Parts; thus, the
Perfon's Beginning in the firtt; his Rife in the second; his Condition
in the third; his Fall in the fourth; and his End in the fitth; as we
shall further illuftrate in the Chapter of fellowing or matching of
Pieces.
In reprefenting an Hiftory the rcift is not always confined to the
Laws of written Story; a good Hifforiographer is obliged to go thro'
with all the particular Facts from the Beginning to the End, in a fuc-
ceffive Order; a Painter, contrarily, has a greater Liberty of Choice,
fince tis indifferent to him, whether he falls upon the Beginning, mid.
dle or End of a Story; and therefore fomcrimes begins where he
pleafes; picking out of the Story what beft fuits his intention, either
What went before, now is in Action, or muft be in Confequence; being
obliged to exhibit no more out of the Whole, than can be feen toge-
ther at one View.

Confequence, arifing from the firft; in the third, the Contention or
Dispure; in the fourth is feen at a Diftance the Iffue of the Story;
and in the fifth, the Caraftrophe or Conclution either in Sorrow or
Joy. But the Drama differs from a Painting in this; that the one con-
tains in each Alt a particular Time, Place or Action; and the other
exhibits only a momentary Action
The Dirifion of the Drama into five Acts is not without Reafon,
from the Example of the Suns Courfe; which begins with Day-break;
fecondly afcends all the Morning; thirdly, has a Meridian alritude;
fourthly, declines in the Afferngon; laftly, fets in the Evening.
He who would ad fure and orderly should ufe the following Means;
which, befides the Truth of the Story, will furnith him with Plenty of
Thoughts.
1. The Time. 2. The Place of Alion. 3. The Conditions of the
Perfons concerned.
By the Time we underfland either the paft, prefent, or to come;
and therein, a Divifion into Night, Morning, Noon and Evening;
alfo into Spring, Summer, Aurumn and Winter; and into Months,
Weeks, Days, t8r.
As for the Place, we muft contider, whether it be in Earope, Assa,
Africa and America; whether in Town or Country, Within or With-
our-doors; in flately or vulgar Buildings, or a Nixture of both.
in the Conditions of Persons we meet with great and iluftrious ones,
a5 Emperors, Kings, Princes, Senators, Generals, Coc. as allo Deities
and High-priells, male and female; in the fecond Tire, Nobility,
Merchanis and Cirizens; lattly, the common People, Countrymen,
Begears, Cr. in thefe Orders of Men, we diftinguith between great
3
Kings and lefs, and the fame in the other Conditions; and divide them
again into old, middleaged and young. Among People in general
we find rall, middle-fizd, thore, thick, flender, well and milhapen,
healthy and fickly, fentible and foolith; all differing as well in their Na-
tures and Humours, as in their Countenances and Shapes.
We may add, in the fourth Place, the Mlanners of each, and the
particular Cultoms of Nations, whether of Romans, Greeks, Persians,
Armemans, Germans, &c. together with their Dreffes, confiffing of
Various Stuffs, as Silk, Linnen, courfe or fine Woollen-cloth, long or thort.
Lallly, the Knowledge of Phyfiognomy, Perspective, Geometry,
Architecture, Anatomy, Proportion, Colours, Harmony, Reffexions,
and every thing that occurs in the Chapters treating of those Particu
lars; which we shall not here repear.

It now remains only to be obferved; firfl, that there are two Sorts
of Piltures, natural and unnatural. Secondly, what good Hiffories
are, in order to thew their Continuance in one Painting. The natural
Pictures are thofe, in which we exhibit the Nature of a Story or Acci-
dent by a fingle Paftion, i. c. by a fingle Reprefentation of the Perfon on
whom the Strets lies. The unnatural are thofe, wherein the fame Per-
fon is reprefented more than once, and thereby two Accidents mixed
together which happened at different Times, as the one by Day, and
the other by Night; which is contrary to Nature, and wherein is often
uled more than one Point of Sight. Secondly, the moft pertinent and
intelligible Hiftories are fuch as that of Heliodorys, defcribed in the
Maccabees, when he was punifhed by the Angel; to which add, the
High-prieft profirate before the Alcar, intreating the Almighty; and
further, the Widows and Orphans, lamenting and crying; all this
thews the Continuance of the Hiffory, and may be brought into one
Piece. Another may be, that of Pompey, where he is burning all the
Letters and Papers of Perpenne in his Sight, and then ordered him to
be carried to his Punishment: And many others.
CHAP. XX. Of the Obfervables in a Frontispiece plate.
1INC E we have treated of many Particulars and their Requi-
I fites, it will be proper here to fubjoin the Difposition of Objects
in a Frontifpiece-plate, and their Obfervables, as being of a diffe-
rent Nature from other Ordonnances, and tending in all Respects to
embellifh the Book only; like a fine Garden-walk, where the Ob-
jells, whether Vafes, Statues, Trees, Coc. are placed to anfwer their
Purpofes.
The Figure which denotes the Subject of the Book, ought by all
means, as the principal, to appear in the middle of the Plate, fet off
by other By-ornaments: Over Head or beneath mult be a large Table
or flat Face, with the Book's Ticle thereon, either in thick black Let-
ters, or elfe double-lind ones, and the other Figures, which ferve for
Illuftration, placed of equal Height on each Side, either flanding or
fitting: Thus much for the fore Cround. The Offskip, having litile
Concern in the Matter, we may difpofe where we think proper with
low or rifing Grounds, in order thereby to give the Uniformity of the
Subject greater Luftre, and a Painterlike Decorum: The principal
Vifle

Vifto ought to be in the middle; but, if two are neceffary for the fake
of hewing fomething in the Offskip, they muft be on each Side, and
equally large and extenfive.

Ber we mut take especial Care, that the Title be encompaffed with
Arctrecrure, or Rockage, or Trees; or at leaff remain within the
fore Ground, which we ought to confider as a Thearrical Stage opened
on one or both Sides with a Curtain, fomerimes fetting it off with a
colonaded Frontifpiece, or elfe incloling it in a Moulding or Compart-
ent; in which Cafe there should always be a founding Fame, either
before or behind, let the subject of the Book be what it will: Even
the Fame alone with the Title of the Book will look more proper,
than the Figre of the Book without the Fame.
I looks well to interibe the Title in the Pendant of the Trumpet,
wher is in the middle of the Plare, and in double-firok’d Letters;
but it it happen to be on a side of the Plate, Tis improper. The ca.
pral biack lecter fuics the middle and bottom of the Place; however,
when the Title muft be placed high, the open Letter is beft, becaute
the other would take the Eve too much, and weaken the reft of the
York. Thus much in general.
itith refrest to Particulars we mult obferve, that the Figure repre-
fenting the Book, should alwars poffets the chief Place in the middle
of the Plate, and that to be elevared; the Figures of less Contequence
fomewhat lower and further in; and thus with the others; each go
ing off according to its Rank, Action and Qualiry, to the Ofsskip; and
if other additional Ornaments are neceffary, they muft be contrived
here and there in Batsrelief
But to explain myself, I shall give a Plate example, and take for the
Subject a Book, carrled Ans MILITARIA, or, 4 Treatife of Military
Exercife Bellons, as the Subject of the Work, fits exalted on an high
and large Pedeftal, in the middle of the Plate, fet off with all Kinds
of warlike Inftruments, as ufual; beneath her, on one Side, flands a
Perfon in an offentive Pofture; and on the other, a defentive Perfon;
thefe three Figures make the whole Story; the latter is reprefented
as a brave Citizen with a Table in his left Hand, whereon is drawn
the Plan of a Forritication, and under his right Arm a Sheaf of Wheat;
the former appears as a vigorous young Man, with a Spike headed
Staff in one Hand, and a Spade in the other, and at his Feet a Crow,
or Wall breaker; on one Side in the Oftship, is a Town -wall, and on
the other some armed Men feering Houfes on fire; behind the former
Htands Vigilancy, and behind the latter Subtilry.
Now

Now we may oblerve, that the aforefaid Uniformity in the Figures,
accompanying Bellona, and which help to explain the Senfe, is una-
voidable; for if one of the hieroglyphic Figures next her were fitting,
and the other flanding, it would caufe an Abfurdity in the Ordon-
nance; becaute thole two Figures ought to thew an Altiviry, or at leaft
to be in a Readinets to undertake some Encerprize: Wherefore they,
as well as thofe behind them, muft be flanding; the latter being plac-
ed there, not as capital Figures, but to aid and subferve the two o-
thers; and therefore, being rather ornamental than neceffary, they
may be left out; as alfo may the Offskip, fince the Subject fufficient
ly appears without it: Neverthelels it may be retained when it does
not obfcure the main Delign; but I should rather chufe to contrive it
in Bassrelief in Stone-work.
All Frontifpiece-plates should have the three following Qualities.
1. To delight the Exc.
2. To fend to the Praife and Honour of the Author and De
figner.
2. To be advantageous to the Seller.
Thefe Obfervacions, tho' little heeded, yet are very necelfary, fince
all Things have a Reference and Tendency to fomething; and tho' by
a proper Application, we muft thew their Qualiries, as in the three in
ftances aforelaid, yer we have a Liberty to make further Additions, if
not foreign to the main Delign of the Compolition: I fay then, that if the
capital Figure be fet off by an Area, Palace, or other Building, that
Ornament mulf come on the right side of the Plate, next to the Bind
ing of the Book, and run off to the left as fcantily as the Delign will
permit. It would be improper to repreient a Table, Pedettal and
Vafe, or such like, holf in the Piece, unlets the Print have a Border
broad enough to be suppoted to hide the other half, or it were on a
third or further Ground. We allo remark, that the Light falling on
the Objects muft be suppoted to come from without the Book; that is,
it proceeds from the left side or opening of the Book, and thoots to the
intide of it, in order thereby to create between them (1 mean, the
Print and the Book) a perfect Union and Sympathy; like that of the
Soul and Body; fuppoling the Book to be the Body, and the Print the
Soul which moves it; to which add, in Confirmation of my Polition,
that the Back of the Book gives Rife to the Print and Leaves.

book, deligned in that Manner; which I shall explain, and give a Proof
of, in the two following Examples.
EKAMPLE I.
I place, on the right side of the Defign, a fine Frontifpiece or Porch
of a Court or Temple, with Wings coming from it on each Side; and
on them, fome People leaning over a Balluftrade; all running to the
Point of Sight, which is in the middle of the Piece: At the Entrance
Rlands2 Prince, Princels or Vefal Virgin; and before him or her, on the
Steps, a Manor Woman kneeling, and receiving a Staff, or a Roll of
Paper: Fame on high founds towards the left; and on the second Ground;
alloon the left Side, (but half withour the Piece) some affrighted Peo-
ple taking their Flight. On the same Side, the Offskip should appear
Villo-wile, like a Gallery, up to the Point of Sight. Now, the De-
fisn being lighted from the lett, and only flightly sketched with black
Chalk, or a Pencil, and rubbed off on another Paper, the former will
fsre the Boot, and the Reverfe, the contrary.
EKANIPL E II. In a Landskip.
On the right side is a mafty Tomb, fupported by Sphinxes, and fet
off with other Stone-work, as Pedeftals and Vafes; the foremoff
whereof are more than half without the Piece; and all running to the
Point of Sight, as in the foregoing. Behind it is a clofe Ground of
Cypress and other Trees up to the Point of Sight; and beyond it is
the Offskip. From the left Side, on the second Ground, may be seen
in part only, some People coming forwards; as a Priefl, Boy with fa-
crifcing Urenfils, the Ax-bearer, and Beafts for Sacrifice. Before the
Tomb, on the Plinth, should fland a fmall ltar; forwards, two or
three Hargies taking their Flight; and from the Tomb Cupid flying
after them, with an Arrow in his Bow, as driving them from thence.
Now reverfe this Drawing alfo, and then obferve the Decorum it pro
Suces.
Alcho’' this Method of proceeding be founded on Reafon and good
Grounds, yer, I fear, many will take it for a Chimera; on a Suppoti-
tion, that we precend to amend fomething, and lay down a politive
Law for what has been feveral hundred Vears left free and unlimitted;
fince Books may, without the aforefaid Obfervations, be good, fell

well, and bear a Price: Again, if a Book be good and have but a Ti-
de-page, without a Frontifpiece-plate, that's enough; even a Plate
ever to poorly handled will pass, if it but thew what the Author treats
of. But let me ask, whether tis not more acceptable to give a Print
great Decorum, and make it better with little Trouble, than to beat
the old Road; especially when we can fupport it by certain Rules,
which will difcover the Error of former Management ? Some perhaps
 Why have not others mentioned this, fince the Politi-
may fay,
on is to poficive! But 1 anfwer, that tho' many Things have been found
out, fomething still remains to be difcovered by the Studies of curious
and inquifitive Men. We grant, that if a Book be bad, the Frontif
piece-plate will not mend it; however, if the Proverb may take place,
a Thing well set off is half fold; and therefore Elegance is very neceltary

Fictions, at leifure Times.
Who can blame a ftudious Arciff for amuling himfelf fometimes
with sketching odd Conceptions, or for painting them? I think it ve
1y commendable, and a true Token of Creatness of Mind, and the
beft Method for excelling in Delign; it's certain, that they, who make
their Art their Diverfion, have a double Advantage in it; becaute
they exercife their Judgments with Ufury in the molt abfirufe Deligns
which the Senfes can comprehend. Let us only confider, with respect
to the People, how acceptable fuch an Artiff muft be, fince moft Men
have an lich for Novelties; as in Plays, which draw the greateff Con-
courfe of People, the more uncommon they are. If any think I ought
rather to maintain, that fuch Artifls ought not to be regarded, and
that they should find their Pleafure in better Things, let me ask in
what? Whether in hearing idle Talk, reading ufelets Books, walking
the Streets, Coc. all which is rather walting lime than Improvement
les not unknown that Raphael, Michael Angelo, and many other famous
Mafters, did fomerimes exercife their Judgments with out of the way

trarily, what good can come of exceffive Drinking, and dipping into
other Things, as if Painting no longer concerned us? 1rs certain we
cannot ferve two Mafters at once; and as certain, that he who fiudies

and of a different Nature, left he deflroy his firft Point: We ought
therefore to accuffom ourfeives to Things which neither over-charge
the Senfes, nor too much burthen the Memory in our Paftimes. A
young Arciff, who at his Leifure endeavours to qualify himfelf for
hne Compositions, mulf especially fhun exceffive Drinking, hearkening
to old Women's Tales,
inquiring after News, reading trifling Books of
Stories and Romances,
principally, Accounts of Murthers and fad Ac
and the like; as allo the Grounds of Mulick:
cidents, Inchantments,
Wine intoxicates, fad Tidings too much affect the Mind, and a Series
of Troubles puts us betide ourfelves; reading of Murthers, Coc. feizes
the Heart, and makes us unit for Study; Curiofity, initead of being
fausied, is to craving, that when we delign fomething fedate, it can
hardly find a Place in our Thoughts; and the Study of Mulick, or
other fuch profound Arr, has too great an Afcendant over our Senfes.
To explain whatl fav, touching the defigning of uncommon Thoughts
at leifure, I shall give three or four Examples, each of a different
Narure: But mult firft inquire, why Painters will not give themfelves
the trouble to delign unutual or barbarous Hiffories, fuch as the Indj.
an, Tapsn of Chinese; and find, that yis, becaule no Authors have
Written anr thing abour them worth skerching, thofe Nacions affording
no other Scene than Cruelcies, Murthers, Tyrannies, and tuch like dit-
agreeable Objects, which would rather offend chan delight: Moreover,
that the Oddnets of their Dreffes, Mfannersand Cultoms do not at all
quidrate with the Grace and Beauty of the ncique. Iis certain, that
the principal Bulinets of an Hiftory-painter is, to express the Story with
proper and livelr Paffions, that his incertion may appear plain and fa-
risfaftory to the Curious; and yet, ths would be no more than the
reading it in the Author, if the Grace of the Figures were not alfo to
accompanr it. Wt hat difgults in a fine Play more than ordinary Atti-
an, bad Dreffes, and a contemptible Stage! If a fine Voice be agreea-
ble to the Ear, how charming muit it be, when the Eye fees it come
from a beautiful Woman: Beauty cauies Love, but Deformity, Aver-
fion Irs therefore no Wonder, that we have no Relith for fuch
odd Subjelts, lince Esroperns are too converfant with real Beau-
ir, to be pleated with fuch Shadows and Gholls: Ver, notwithfland
ing what is laid of the Figures and Histories, I think it not unworthy
of a Landship painter fomeimes to exhibit fuch uncommon Landskips,
becaute the Oddnets of the Grounds, Trees and Buildings found in
them is pleating to moft People, especially thofe who are converfant
with their Hiffory; and indeed this Novelry of Prospect is no ways to

repagnant to Art or Nature, as the People and their Manners, in spoil-
ing the Shape which God and Nature gave them.
If it be faid, that fuch Landships are improper without Figures of
the fame Country, it mull be granted; neverthelels, as the By-orna-
ments of a Landskip are ufually the leaft regarded, I think it not dif
agreeable, to exhibit here and there fome of thofe Creatures, in order
to thew the Narure of the Country: A judicious Arcift may difpole
them as he thinks beft for the Good of the whole Picture, and the
Pleafure of the Eyc; and becaule thofe Countries are well known to
Enrepeans, he can incroduce them there, and intermix with them Tra-
vellers from other Countries, as Persans, Romans, Greeks, &cc. who
may add to its improvement; as we introduce Whites into the Blacks
Country, and Blacks into Greece.
But perhaps another Difficulty may be ftarted againtt fuch Land.
skips, namely, that they cannot be handled to natural and true, 2s
where we can have the Life before us; which indeed is probable;
however it mult be granted, that the Authors, treating of thofe Parts,
are to many and to particular, that a Man of Judgment may gather
fufficient instruction from them; the Temperature of the Air, Fruit-
fulness of the Soil, Shape of the Trees and other Greens, and their
Natures and Colours are plainly fet down; and if the green happen to
be a little lighter or darker, or the Ground more yellow or rulfet,
who will go about to difprove it, if artfully managed! For my part,
I should make no Scruple to paint fuch a Piece, fince a Painter
ought to flip no Opportunity of getting Praife, and with to have done
it, according to my prefent Ides of it: If we omit doing many Things
for want of a proper Knowledge of them, what cannot the Pencil of a
judicious Mafter do, if he will but fet about ir? Vet some Men will not
go out of their old Road, as was the Cale of a Fellow-pupil with me un
der my Father; who, on my asking him, why he painted not other Sub-
jells as well as Bible-ffories? antwered, that he had no Occation to feek
after others, fince the Bible yielded more than he could do in his whole
Life: Which indeed was no Wonder; fince he painted one Story ten
times, if it pleafed him. But we shall now come to the Reprefentati-
ons we promifed.

The Figure which accompanies her holding a Dagger, with Cyprels-
leaves about its Head and Walle, reprefents Desparr, as the broken
Pair of Compaffes, flicking in its Girdle plainly thews. Now perhaps
It may be asked, becaute a xcretid is opening her Wound, whether the
Dagger should not become her! which I grant; as having committed
the Petchro' theother's Inlligation. Iis certain, that theres no need
of By-help, as we shall prove in its Place, in the Batsrelief of Mele-
ager when the Mischief is done by our own Hands; but here the
Cafe is very different; for Aeleager was there dying, and the Revenge
not yet execured; whereas here the Revenge is already had, becaute
the is producing her Wound, and therefore the greatelt Effelt of De-
(pair is over, and the thews him the bloody Dagger by means of De-
pair; which Figure would indeed be superfiuous, were the not fuppo-
fed to be faying,—
This Steel did it. For if the were in a deipe-
tate Polture with the Dagger in her Hand, the Figure of Despair
would be imincelligible, and therefore fuperfluous. Again, it would
be abfurd, to make her stab herfelf at his Bed-fide, fince no Spectre
of any Perfon can appear before a Separation from the Body; where-
fore the shews herfelf to the Debanchee, as the Caule of her untimely
Death, in order to bring him to Remorfe, and for that Reafon Despair

The Lamp on the Table, and in a princely Apartment, may perhaps
feem odd; neverthelets I think, it has a fine Effect on the foremoll Fi-

This Cavalcade 1 exhibit in an Hall richly furnished, reprefenting
the Figures in a waving Motion, and skimming, over the Floor, a
Foot high, on a thin Cloud, cross the Picture to a Defcent of 2 or 3
Sceps on the left Side; and thence, on the fame side, up to a Back-
door on the left Side of the Point of Sight, where they dilappear.
The Bed, a little raifed, flands backward in the middle of the Piece;
the aforefaid Shades are vapourith, but not tharp: Forwards, on the
left Side, I place, on a Pedeftal, the Figure of a fitting Alexander,
with Thunder in his Hands, a Clobe in his Lap, and an Eagle by his
Side; and behind the Pedeftal fland two Centinels in earneft Difcourfe,
infentible of what is doing.
Let it not be thought, becaute I make the three Parts of the World
fetter’d, that Alexander, by his Valour, fubdued them; for, accord-
ing to the Tellimony of some Writers, he did not conquer all Asa;
neverthelels, that his Ambition made him hope to do it, is not impro=
bable; fince he cauted himfelf to be worthipped as a fecond Tupiter

I have faid, that the Shades or Appearances walked as on a Cloud;
b: which I mean a thin Vapour, ferving them for a Ground, and giv.
ing a fimt Shade to the Hall-foor; yer the Vapour and Groundhade
are of roother lfe, than to express Things in a fupernatural Way,
and to make a Dillintion between real and imaginary People.
I have leen fuch a Thought painted by Fordaims; where a Man is
dreaming in his Bed; and before it ffood a naked Woman, appear-
ing as a real one, who (one would think) was going to Bed to him,
had not the Arcift painted there some Clouds, as if the were flanding
in a Door of Clouds: Whence I was led to think, the might be a Spec
tre; but then, not having a ghaftly Appearance, I thought the had too
great a Communication with the rell of the Picture; the was seen from
behind, and very beautifuliy coloured: I and others therefore conclud
ed, that this Woman was only a Model; to which the other Particu
lars were added, in order to parch up a Picture, and fill the Cloch.
Bir to return to our Ordonnance.
My Thoughts are, that Alexunder mult not be reprefented naked on
the Bed, but in princely Attire; for otherwife the Door mult not fland
open; and I am no: conined to the Chamber-light, becaute of the
Shades or Spectres; wherefore, in reference to that, I have two
Points in View; firfl, to keep the Light as beautiful as Sun fhine; or
fecondly (which is better and more ghattly) to keep it fomewhat gloomy,
in order to exprefs naturally the Vapouriness; and by it the Vannty
of human Condition.
An odd Fuble.
The Fable wrights tell us, that, in the Beginning of Time, a Diffe
rence arofe between ffollo and Dians, both in their Vouth, who
should produce the finelt Aimals, wherewith to furnith the World;
Tupiter, as chief Ruler in Heaven, for Paltime allow’d it, and gave
them Power to do it: After many Challenges and Disputes, it was
finally agreed, that polle, in the Prefence of all the Gods, should
make the firft Eftay; and accordingly, to general Admiration, he
produced a large Lyon. Dians fentible of it, and feeing the Gods
taken up with the Sight of to strange a Creature, and fearful that
he should not produce the like, brought forth a Cat, a Creature not
unlike the Lyon, but as much inferior in Strength and Shape, as the
Moon is to the Sun. Whilff the Gods were laughing at this, Apolle
was to netiled at the Pretumption of Dians, in thinking herfelf his

March, that he infiantly brought forch a Moufe; to thew, in a fcom-
ful Way, that the Cat was not comparable with the Lyon: Where-
upon Diang fummoned all her Wit and Power to bring our a Mon-
Key; which Creature, like the former, being found to be very ridicu-
lous, and her Endeavours adjudged fruicless by the Gods, the was. fo
provoked, as to create an eternal Enmity between the Lyon and the
Monkey, and the Cat and the Moute.
Ordennance of the Fable.
Apollo, as a Vouth of about 14 Vears of Age, flands a little to the
left of the Point of Sight, holding in his right Hand a Scepter, which
relts againtt his Hip; he flands in a daring Pofture on one Leg, has a
fierce Lo0k, and on his right Side, a little from him, fits a large Ly-
on. Over-againtt Apolle, a little forward, fands the young Diand,
holding up a Dart in her right Hand, and feeming to call up a Mon-
Key from the Earth, who, half out of the Ground, looks grinning be-
hind him at a Moufe, which, becaute of the Cat flanding by Diana,
teems to creep away under the Legs of Apollo.
The Deiries view thofe flrange Things with Pleafure; Tupiter and
June fit by themfelves on a low Cload in the middle: Near Apolle and
Diana are feen Mercury and furora; and on the right Side forwards,
Mars and Bacchas, the former lying on a Stone: Venus, attended by
Cupid, lies on the Grats; and next them, a litle further, Ceres, fir-
ting in the Lap of Rbea, points and laughs at the Monkey: Between.
thele two and the Cloud, whereon fits Tupiter and Tune, appears
Saturn: On the left Side forwards fits Pullas with Esculapins, be-
tween Iris and Gunimedes: Behind Apollo advances Momus, Rooping
forwards with his Bawble upright in his lefc Hand, whereon he leans,
and, looking to the right, makes a fcornful Sneer his other Hland
is wide open, with the Thumb on the Tip of his Nofe. The whole
Affembly of the Gods, except Apollo, looks merry and gay.

Now, to obtain this Likelihood or Probabiliry, befides the Requi-

the Work.
By the Ferms we are to underfland the Proportions of their Bodies.
By the Charatters, the Features which alter from time to time
with their Vears; from Vouth to Maturity; from thence to middle
Age; and thence to old Age.
By the Colears we mean, the fair, rofy, pale or brown; belides
long or fhort, dark, ruffec, light or black Hair, long or frizled Beards:
in tne, such an one muft be known to be the same Person, thro' all the
Compositions, without any Alteration.
The same Condult muft be obferved, with respect to the Atten
dants or Recinue; especially a black Man and Woman, who, if they
have any Part in the flacely Actendance in the firft Compolition, mutt
maintain that Poft to the laft; becaute, being Slaves, they are feldom

specially when they have been obferved to attend them feveral times

les necellary, for avoiding Millakes, to know how many Obmpiads
the whole Work takes in, and exactly to enquire into the different
Vears in which the firft, second, third and fourth Story ended, in of
der to affign each Charalter its certain Age, abating for Accidents,
which indeed to alter People, that they gec out of Knowledge; as in the
thin and flender, becoming thick and fac; and in the brisk and (pright-
ly becoming dull and heavy; and the contrary; and yet thole ccr
dents leave the Features, whence Likenets proceeds, in their Per-
feltion.
But here perhaps it may be asked, if we follow this Obfervation
punctually, whether the Likenels would not be to leffened as to be
quite loft in old Age? To which I agree, to far as respells the Colour
and Fichhiness, the one in a greater, the other in a lels Degree; yet
the Chgralter, with all its known Feactures, is, what maintains Likenets
be a Man ever to old; wherefore, his receffury to make that appeat

when full grown, he did his Miracles; and was, finally, accuted, con
demned and put to Death at about thirty.
Laftly, we ought to obferve, that the Life and Acchievements fome
times follow in a long Series of Vears, and fucceffively; as in the Sto-
ries of Remulus, Julus Cafar, Scipie, Alexander, and many others;
and, in Scripture, Chrif, John, &cc of some of which, we have large-
ly treated in our Book of Tables and Emblems, which we shall pub-
hin in due Seafon
We leave it now to any one's Judgment to confider, how neceffary
the aforefaid Obtervations are in the Continuance of an Hiftory; where
in we muft alfo take Care, that the Horizon through the whole Work
be of one Height, and level with the Eye of the Bebolder; as we have fe-
veral times faid in its Place.
The same Condult as we have recommended for Figures, respects al.
to all immoveable Objects belonging to the Story; for inftance, if the
general Subject require, that a Palace or Houfe muft come in more
than once, Tis necelfary that it always keeps its firft Form and Station,
only altering the Point of Sight, as we would have it feen either in
Front or Reir, or in Flank, either near of diftant.
The Orders and Ornaments of Arcbitefture likewife come under the
tame Regulation; for the Froncifpiece, Balcony, Porch, Steps, Rails,
Balluffrades, Statues, Windows, Coc. muft remain the fame in each
Compoficion; and not only fo, but of the same Marble and the same
Wood, abaring for the Decays of Time.
With the inward Ornaments the Cafe is the fame; for the Rooms
mast not be adoraed in two different Manners, but with Tapeltries
or Pitures of fuch or fuch a Choice. The inner Court may be fet off
with Fountains, Starues, Cl.
No greater Overfight can therefore, in my Opinion, be commit
sed on inch an Occation, than to employ different Hands in to capi
cal a Work, becaute they commonly differ in Manner, Handling and
Knowledge, as much as Night and Day; whence t happens, that the
Chain of a Story is to broken and dubious, that, without an Expla-
nation, is difficult to know whom or what it reprefents; ope fof-
lowing the antique Gulto; another the modern; one giving his Per-
langes a certain Likepets, and another giving the fame Perfon a
Charalter quite different from that of the former, as it hits their Fan
cres and Choice; to that Virgifs Saying is not amiss, Amant alferng

the former, he was in Armour and bareheaded, more or lets ancique

little like that of the former, as his Dress. Now how ridiculous this muft

this a fufficient Caution to thofe who may be concerned in fuch Works.

Word, lies in the Features, how mch foever a Perfon may advance in
Vears.
To hit the Likenets well, and prevent the aforefaid Miftakes, the
following is the beft Method: Chufe a fine Plaifter face, either of
Manor Woman, which has such an fir as the Subject requires, whe
ther model, auftere or amorous; this Face we muft make ule of from
the Beginning to the End of the Work, where thofe Obfervations are
necellary, either in Front or Prefile, and with frch a Light as is pro-
per to the whole Dessgs, whether right or left, forward or backward,
Candle or Torch; all this to be done without any Variation, except
tomewhat in the Liveliness and Flethinets, which, through Vears, 1s
continually abating in both Sexes, as we have before faid.
As to the Motion of the Raffions, canted by particular Accidents,
we have, in a former Chapter, fhewed a Method, how to manage in
fuch Cafes, without the Life.
Having said thus much touching the Ordonnance, I think it not im-
Proper to Tubjoin two Observations, which are as necellary to what
has been faid as to what shall hereafter be treated of, namely, a De-
scription of the Conditions of Men in the Summer; and Winter Sea-
sons; and conclude this Book with an Emblem.
A. Man in Summer


Is vallly affected by the Hleate which, thinning the Blood, makes it
fow with cafe to the Extremicies of the Body; whereby the Mo-
tions are freed from Rettraint.. The Head is raited; the Shoulders
fink; the Arms and Legs spread; the Hlands and Fingers opened,
whereby each Part of the Body; feems to refreth irfelf,, affarding every.

cauting alto the Vapours, which afocod to the Brain and fall again. on
the Eyes; the Hair ffuck behind the Ears hangs down the Back, to
that all feems to be uncovered
A Man in the Winter Season.
To express this Figure well, is necelfary to explain Cold itfelf, as
being the Canfe of the fublequent Motions The Blood, wherein lies
the Warmsh of the Body, is (by means of Cold, which is it's oppo-
Iixe, and enters from without, thro' the Pores) forced inwardly; to that
it paffes chieffy from the fmall Members, to wit, Fingers and Toes, to
its Center Wherefore we fee that, to keep off outward Cold, Peo-
ple fink their Heads into their Breafts; raife their Shoulders; hug
themfelves very clofe with their Hands under their Arm-pits, which
the Cold cannot cafily affect; the Knces joined, Legs fomewhat bent,
and the whole Body fooping; the Eyes almoff fhit, or kept open
with Difficulty; the Monsh cloted; the upper Lip hidden by the un-
der one, which covers it up to the Nofe, to prevent the Colds enter
ing the Body; the Hair hangs carelefty both before and behind.

The beff Method, a Perton of weak Memory can take, is, to exer-
cife his Judgment on Things at the Instant they
prefent themfelves to
him; that is, to fet down what he has a mind
to Keep, that he may
at any time have recourfe to it for his focure information and Re
membrance; and this to be repeated till he has gained what he wants:
Bot this cannor well be done, unlets he, at frch Times, fuspend the
Ufe of three of his Seates, Hearing, Toffe and Smell, and retain only
Sight anl Feeling, according to our Sketch, thus:
A young Alan, in his Prime, is fitting at a fmall Table, with a Pen
of Crayon in his Hand; Momery is fitting over againft him, holding
upright an open Book, wherein Trath is reprefented, to him on the T2.

of Grases, the fourth, a Pye; the fifth, a Partridge; the fixth, a
Foots Cap.
Thus we may eafily fee, how weak and imperfelt we are, when
Fudyment does not affift us, and we are mifted by the Bent of a cor-

CH AP I. The Difference between what is ntique and Medern.
2422 E are now obliged, to pat in Execution our Purpofe of
2 making a proper Diftinction between Things Ancique
, and Modern; fince the Difference between them is to
great, that they cannot unite, without cauting excef-
lve Deformity; for Things Antique are always the same,


but the Mode continually changing; its very Name imolies
its Mutabiliry; fince nothing is more unconflant than what depends on
Falhion; which alters not only annually, but even daily in thofe who
mimick the Court. Thefe Contraricties, which are to confounding,
and caule fuch a Variance between what is antique and modern, we fee
chieffy in the Composition of Hiffories, Fables, Emblems, and fuch
like; in which both (yet the Miodern moft) are blended together.
Congruity and Suitablenets in the Compolition of Hiftories are true
Tokens of a judicious Mafter. What is more glorious, than while we
are ravithing the Eye, to pierce the Heare! While the Sight is recre-
ated with the Beauties of the Art, to transport the Mind with the

Decorum and Energy of the Compolition? He therefore is efteemed a
prudent Malter, who not only gives every thing its profer Colours, but
alfo its due Expression, pure and uncerrupted. Thus we fee that great
Mafters, who are got to that Perfeltion, do not blend Things promif
cuoully, and without Dillinction, as Eaft, Weft, South and North in
a Chaosmanner; becaute, with the lirtle Mafters, we should then act
againll Nature; it is therefore necelfary, that we nicely confider what
it is we intend to reprefenc, to the end that we may not fail in giving
the true Meaning of it. How can the Truth of a Thing be known,
unless it be reprefented as clear as a literal Explanation! Let us then,
curious Arcifts! fedately weigh, what gives the Art fuch an Effect and
Luflre: Have ye a mind to borrow any thing for your Ordonnance,
examine firft the Story ye delign to handle, whether it be Persian,
Greek, Roman, &cc. Will ye reprefent & Durins, chufe all your Ma
terials from the Persians, for his Atcirement. Will ye bring 4 De-
moftbenes on the Stage, learn the proper Circumflances of the Atheni-
ans, and make him appear a great Heroc. Will ye exhibit the vali-
ant]/ Scipie, give him a Roman Drels, and other Neceffaries from that
People luitable to it. By this means each Perfonage will have his true
Property, and you will shew your Skill in Hiftory, and alfo, by obferv-
ing the Time when, and Place where, reprefent the Subject according
1y. Would ye exhibit High or Low Dutch, English or French Stories,
fetch no Materialsfrom Perfa, Greece or Italy; each Country can furnith
fufficient Matter properfor its Climate, to wit, Plants, Manner of Living,

Pallimes, Houle ornaments, Stuffs, Dreffes, publick Worships, Times
and Manners of Earing and Repofe: All which Particulars muft be
attentively confidered, in order to gain our Point, and for which Pur-
pofe Reading and Books are neceffary: For as a Profeffor in Law muft
draw his Knowledge from the Marrow of the Roman, German and o-
ther Writers of Jurifprudence; a Divine from Scripture and the Com-
mentators thereon; and a Philofopher the fame; to a Painter ought
to be skill’d in the Reprefentations which he makes his principal Stu-
dy, whether the fame be ancient or modern. Hence we judge, what
a Fund of Knowledge is requifice: If a Painter would be univerfal, he
should almofl know every thing; nay, more than many other Arcifts

ledge of Mathematies, Philolophy, Geography, Hiltory, Coc.
Do not meddle then either with Things which you are not conver-
fant with, or follow the Advice of others; for tis more commendable
to sketch a Dog or Cat well, than an Elephant, Camel or Crocodile
poerly. Are you dilpoted to handle an ancient Stery, berrow nothing
for it that's ncw, and of modern Invention; fince what is difquited with
Falhood cannever be Truth; like a Traveller, who darkens Truth by
his own Additions, whole Whims make him defcribe Things he never
faw, and that, to a Perfon who, on due Confideration, foon difcovers the
Fallacy. The Arcifts Judgment itself mult therefore always go before; and
all that he undertakes be governed by Reason and Nature: An Ialian
should not be in an Iadian Drefs; or a Persion in a flathc Doublet, fince
the Perfon we defire to know, does thereby become anknown. Each Coun-
try and People are known, not only by their Habies, but by all the other
Circumffances before-mentioned; give then to each its own Requifites,
and every Thing that's proper to it. How excellent muft a Pilture
appear, and with what Admiration viewed, when every Thing has its
due Qualiries, and the Whole, a prudent Management! What will not
the Arrift merit, if he perform nothing beyond his Strength and
Knowledgel For, fince we cannot know all Things in Perfection, we
muft keep within the Bounds of our Underftanding. He who would be
every where, is feldom found any where; and by confounding Things
does, inflead of real Judgment, difcover his lile Skill. Reprefent
then no more than your Capacity will admit; and principally take
care, not to intermix modern and ancient Dreffes, and Furniture in the
some Composstion: Thus we thew a generous Spirit for Eminence, and
with the excellent former and later Halias, Frencb, Flemiss, and other
Mafters, an Emulation to excel in what is noble, great and artful.
I think I cant beter describe the Difference between what is Antique
and Mlodern, than by a Windball and an Egg, thus; the Ball, by be
ins teffed to and fro, and at laft burfting, repretents sbort Duration,
affording nothing but Wind; but the Egg harched and opened, produ
ees a living Creature; not only a Semetbing, but something good; the
former, a mere Nothing; or, if it have a Name, tis Vanity, and
therefore rather bad than good.
Painting was, by the ancient Remans, to highly effeemed, that none
but Noblemen durff learn it: As we may allo gather from the Paint
ers, feveral of whom have been of noble Extraction: And the Reafon
of it is very evident, fince tis not only probable; but reafohnable, that

such ingenious Spirits should have a diflinguithing inclination for Arts,
fuitable to their Qualicy, above the Vulgar. Their Meditations, c
tions, and Perceptions were fixed on great and fublime Things: They
inquired into, and confulted many excellent Authors of Hiflory, Fa-
bles and Emblems, as well facred as profane, and the Accounts of
ancient Medals; from whence they have drawn pleatiful and ingeni=
ous Matter for their Studies: What excellent Paintings have they not
oblig’d the World with! How many Temples, Palaces, and other
fare Structures have they eariched with elegant Devices inciring to Vir-
tue; whereby they have bequeathed a lafting Name to Pofterity 1
How did Archicecture (never enough to be praifed) ffourith in their
Times. But what Alterations do we fee now? How are the Beauties
and profitable Ofes of Painting either funk, oblcured or flighted, fince
thet Bambocciades are multiphed in these Countries; at prelent we can
fcarce fee one Virtue appear, but ten, nay an hundred Vices will rife
counter to it; thus has lprung up a fecond Hydra like that of Lerna;
to that we want a valiant Hercules to lop off thofe Dragons Heads
which are always (prouting. Thus Architecture itself, how excellent
foever, is, with the right Praltice of Painting, brought into Diffrace,
and flighted by other Nations; fince we fcarce fee a beautiful Hall or
fine Apartment of any Coll, that is not fet out with Pictures of Beg=
gars, Obfcenities, a Genera-Stall, Tobacco fmoakers, Fidlers, :nafty
Children ealing Nature, and other Things more filchy. Who can. en-
tertain his Friend or a Perfon of Repute in an Apartment lying thus
in litter, or where a Child is bawling, or wiping clean! We grant,
that thefe Things are only reprefented in Picture: But is not the Art
of Painting an lmitation of the Life; which can either please or teatbs
If then we make fuch Things like the Life, they mulf needs raife an
Averfion. They are therefore too low and unbecoming Subjects for
Ornament, especially for People of Fathion, whole Conceptions ought
to furpats the Vulgar. We admit indeed that all this is rt, or at
leaft called fo, when the Life is thereby naturally expreft; but how
much the beautiful Life, skilfully handled, differs from the defellive
Life of modern Painters, let the Curious determine. Iis certain that
Men (and Beafts too) have each a particular and different inclinagion to
particular Things; whereby they love whats agreeable to their Na-
tures, the one good, the other bad, becaute (as some pretend) they
are governed and influenced by certain Conflellations happening at their
Births: This at leaft we know, that one Man inclines to Hupting, and

a Country-life; another, to War, Strife and Contention; another to
Merchandife and Deceir; this, to Politicks and great Things; that, to
Pieatures, CEc. So that in each we difcover what his Nature and Paffion
i5 prone to.
But let us refielt on the two Arts, Noble and Ignoble; or Antique
and Ardern, and fee how much they differ both in Objects and Execu
tion. The Antique is unlimited, that is, it can handle fylery, facred as
well as profane, Fables and Emblems both moral and (piritual; un
der which three Heads it comprehends, all that ever was, is, and shall
be; the pr7, present and to come; and that, after an excellent Manner,
which nover afters, but remains always the same: The modern, contrari-
1y, is so far from being free, that it is limited within certain narrow
Beands; and is of small Power; for it may or can represent no more than
whit is prejent, and that too in a Manner which is always changing:
What is pal anl to come is without its Power; as alfe Hiftories, Fables and
Emblems, as well paetical and philesephic as moral. Hence we may judge
what the modern Art of Painring is, and why it cannot be called noble;
much less have any Harmony with the antigse. I could affign more
Caufes for this Dilunion, but shall at prefent omit them for two Rea-
fons; firff, becaute Mens Judgments are to various; and each argues
according to his Paffions and Inclinations, in Proportion as he likes or
diffifes a Thing: Secondly (which is the principal) that I may not be
thought to raile any Sufpicions of Partiality or Prepoffeffion. But why
should I refirain my Thoughts! Ler me (peak plain in Spire of others;
I fay then, that altho' modern Things feem to have some Prettiness,
yet they are only to be efteemed as Diversions of the Art. I moreover
Mmaintain, that fuch Painters, as never produce more than one Choice
of Subjects, may truely be ranked among Tradefmen; fince fuch Re-
prefentations cannot be called an Exercile of the Mind, but an han-
dycraft Trade.
By fuxh Remarks as thefe, we may fufficiently perceive, that from
Apprebension, Knowledge and Judgment (pring ine Luttre and Elevaii
on of the antique Art of Painting; and contrarily that Ignorance, Weg-
hgence and Self-will debale and fubjelt the modern: So that the Ancients
have not improperly placed Mlinervy by the one, and Midas by the
other; intimating by the former, Skill in the Art, Prattice, Careful-
ness and an beavenly Talent; and by the latter, Imprudence, blind Leal,
worldly Deferts and Hindrances.
But if any one would perhaps examine, whether there be not a
Mcars to make the Modern noble, as well as the Antique, that they
might both march together, they would find it to be Labour in vain;

fince Defects once got fooring are not ealily remedied: But further,
we often hear with Wonder, that Painters perfuade one another thaty.
in handling a Subject, is enough to follow Nacure, tho' the be defec
tive; as crooked, lame, (quint ey’d, or blind; and that when the is imis
cated with a delicate Pencil, that is fufficient; and fuch is their Zeal and
extraordinary Pains, that one paints for that end the Air of his Wife,
tho' ever to ugly, with all her Freckles and Pimples very exactly;
whereby the Agreeableness of a beautiful WomansFace is quite loft: An-
other chules his clownith unmannerly Maid-fervant for his Model, and
makes her a Lady in a Saloon: Another will pix a Lords Dress on
4 School-boy, or his own Son, tho' continually froaking his Hair be-
hind his Ears, foratching his Head, or having a down lookf thinking
it fufficient to have followed Nature, without Regard to Grase,, which

ought to be reprefented; or having recourfe to fine Plailler-facea;
which are to be had in Abundance.
The beautiful and well -compoted Airs in a Picture of many or few
Figures, have a great Effet on the Minds of the Knowing; of which
the Ancients were thoroughly fenlible; for in the moft perfelt Bodks
they made the Face chieffy to excel in Beauty and Agreeableness. Na
one of Judgment will deny, that a beautiful and well carriaged Wo
man has fuch an Afcendant as moft effedually to move her Beholdorg
in two different Manners, and by two contrary Paltions; under Misfor=
tune or in raging Pain, the will pierce a Mans Heart, and move him
to Compaffion; and when the entertains us on any joyful Occafion,
with Singing or Laughing, the will at once delight us: A clowniff
Woman contrarily, will not produce any fuch liffects; for her Behold
ers, thro' her Unmannerlinels and fimple Behaviour, defpife her Mirth,
and mock her ridiculous Sorrow.
What great Defeet do we not fill find in modern Painters, when they
ufe, or rather abufe, the Life; not doing like thole, who being accut
tomed to a pobter Manner, view the Lite with Knowledge and Judg-
ment, that is, not as it ordinarily appears, but as it ought to be, in its
greateff Perfection: Whereas the others, blinded by Cultom, havg no
tuch Nicery; becaute they imitate the Life just, as they fee it, wiifiont
any Difference: We even fee them make it, more deformed than Na-
ture ever produces; for the more mit fhapen Faces Bambeccie,, Offace,
Browwer, Melfer and many others made, the more they were efteemd
by Ignorants: By which fow Choiges we can: eafily judge,, that they
were Strangers to Beaury, and Admifers of Deformity: However tis
an infallible Rule, that daily Cultom and Converte with People, like

ferred to Vircue, and what should be thunn’d fought; whereas he who
is fentible of Virrue will always endeavour to elcape Error.
CH AP. II. Method for reprefenting what is City-like, or elegant
Modern.

HE continual Changes in worldly Things afford us pleatiful
Matter for modern Manner without recourte to Hiftory, Fables
or Emblems; even to much as to be endless; as may be gather
of from the Affemblies for publick Worhip, Pleadings in Courts,
Plays, Family-occurrences, and the like: All which we perceive to
be either majeftic, amorous, forrowful, or otherwife. Tbose Things,
how different soover, can be represented in the antique Manner as well as
in the modera, provided each keep its Quality; as I have already intimat-
ed, and shall further infifl in the fublequent Examples; which can be
handled in both Manners alike natural and proper, without either's ber-
rowing any thing from the other but the Subjett. This I think worthy
of Remark; and the rather, fince, to my Knowledge, no Auchor,
treating of Things Antique and Modern, has faid any thing touching
It
Fra. Afieris has not only curioutly followed his Mafter Gerard Doy,
in the elegant modern Manner, but is, in some Things, his Superior;
and the rare Pousin, and Raphael, Prince of the Italian Painters, ex-
sell’d in the Antique: Let us then follow their Examples in what is
moft agreeable to our Guftos; and tho' the latter far exceed the for
mer in Nobleness, iis however more commendable, to be like a good
Mieris in the modern Manner, than a bad Raphael in the antique. Tho
1 remember to have feen a Picture of old Afieris, which, as often as
I think of it, furprifes me; it was an halflength Figure, about the
Bigaets of the Palm of the Hand, reprefenting the Art of Painting,
holding a Vizor in her Hand; its Air, Headactire, Dress and Furm
ture to very beautiful and truly antique, that I never faw the like done
by any other medern Mafter, how skilful foever. Whence it appears,
how rare it is for a modern Mafter to give into the Antigse.
Let us now reprefent the Cale of Parents permitting their Children
to take some Diversions in Barbing: A Delign which can be as well ex-
eratedin the Antigue as the modern Manner.. The Bagnio: comes for-

ward in the Piece, having a Defcent into it of two Steps: The Boys,
from 12 to 19 Vears old, about the Water and in it, are naked: A
Daughter, of 20 Vears of Age, is feen with a fine white Linnen
Cloth over her Body, in order to cover what Modefty conceals, and as
is cultomary on fuch Occafions; neverthelels her Arms and Part of her
Legs are bare; the is coming up the Steps on the left Side: One of
the aforelaid Boys holds her falt by a Flappet of the wet Cloth, in or-
der to prevent her going up: Further behind, near a Bed, the eldeff
Daughter, about 25 Vears old, appears almoft unthified; and near
her, a Maid-fervant to put the Clotk about her: The Father we repre-
fent, dreft either in his Cloaths, or a Japan Night-gown, flandingon
the Brink of the Bagaio, and laughing at the Boys who are in it, and
playing their Tricks: One of them is flanding with his left Leg on the
Steps, and with the other Foor juft touches the Water; the joungeff Boy
lies on his Belly excended on the lowermolt Step, plathing with his
Hands in the Water; the Cloth of the Daughter, who is flepping out
of the Bagnio, dropping wer, flicks to clofe to her Body, that the Naked
nets of the Members appear frantparently through it: The Mother all
this while is buty in ferving fome Sweet -meats on a Table covered
with a Napkin, near which, a Child, of 2 orz Years of Age, is fitting
in a Chair in his Shirt; to whom the offers a Macaroon. Somewhat
further are feen filk Gowns, Petticoats, velvet Scarves, Hoods, Coc.
hangingon Pins: On a Table are lying pearl Neck-laces, Bracelets and
other Irinkets: In fine, the whole Difpolition is moft orderly, natural
and beautiful. As for the Boys Cloaths, to wit, Coats, Hats, Breech-
es, Stockings, Shoes, Coc. they lie on the Brink of the Bagnio.
Now I refer it to the judicious Reader, whether the Daughter,
who, on the lefe Side, is flepping out of the Bagnio, ought not, not-
withflanding her being covered with the Cloth, to be reprefenced
beautiful and Chapeable in her Arms, Legs, Hands and Feet, nay, e
ven her Body alfo, to faras the Nakedne's appears thro' the wer Cloth?
Her Modefty appears evidently by her bathful Look: What a Carriage
thew the Feet and whole Body, while the endeavours to cover the
Parts which Modefty conceals! And how modeftly does the flep up, in
Read of expoting thofe Parts by a wanton Gate! Iask further, whe
ther the Boy, who is slopping her by the Flapper of the Cloth, ought
to be less beautiful and well-made than the Father in the flowered 7a-
Dan Gown? The Boy the fame, who lies extended on his Belly; in
whom mult appear innocence and Childifhness: The eldelf Daughter in
her Bloom, well defcended and virtuoully educated. To whom shall we
liken


Of Things Antique and Modern. Book III.
134
liken her? Whence muft we ferch her Beauty ? And whom must we
ale for a Model? A vulgar Perfon, or one of a better Appearance
Even this latter would be infufficient for the Purpofe, if not well edu-
cated and fine carriaged; becaute Beauty without Grace looks mishapen
and fiff. This Virgn then, who is, except in her Feet, quite naked,
ought principally to be painted as beautiful and agreeable as a Grecian
Jenus; I mean not, a wanton one, but an 7 Heavenly one, i. c. a vir-
tuons one; for as much as the Soul differs from the Body, and the Bo-
dy from the Dress, does Nobility from Commonalty, Virtue from De-
feel. If any one ask, where he shall find thofe Beauties; I refer him
in the firft Place, to the Books which treat of perfect Proportion;
wherein true Grace coniits Whilft he is findious in thofe, he ought
to have the belt Plaitter figures before him, in order to exercife his
Underflanding, and thereby acquire a folid Judgment. If it be again
objected, that the Plailler is not equal to living Nature, I own it; for
I mean not, that the Arriff should paint Flefh-colour after them, but
get a perfelt Idea of their f Beauty, Grace and Agreeableness, boch
E
general and particular; whence Perfection fprings; for the Colouring is
evident, and eafy enough to be found in the Lite, as I could prove in
leveral Inflances of fome ordinary Painters who coloured well ; who,
before they had made much Prooress in the Art, were cried up for
great Men, and ret, having any Thing extraordinary to do, were not
able to sketch well an Head, Hand or Foor.
The modern Puinting can therefore not be accounted Art, when Nu-
tare is simply followed; which is a meer imperfect imitation or defec
are aping her. Even, were a Thing reprefented ever fonatural, well
defigned and properly ordered; the Condition, Manners and Cultom
of the Country well obferved, and the Colouring moft exact, yet the
Knowing will not think it artful : But when Narure is corretted and
improved by a judicious Mafter, and the aforefaid Qualities joined to
it, the Painting muft then be noble and perfect.
I fay therefore, with respect to the Naked, whether of Man, Wo
man or Child, that when tis not exhibited moft beautifully, or in its
due Proportion, the modern Painting cannot deferve the Name of Art;
and with good Reafon, fince this is the only Method whereby to make

rofe two alike Sinters accord.
Jan Dis, never enough to be commended, gained Excellence in the
rigue as well as the modern Manner, by strictly following the afore-
said three Graces in both; and he thereby acquired the Epithet of

Matchless: Let us therefore follow his noble Example in what made
him to tamous; fince he is the firft who carried the modern Manner fo
high as to gain it the Name of Art. Whence we may eafily conclude,
what great Difference there mult be, between a Painter who makes
the modern or defeitive Life, his Study and Excellence, and one who
follows the Antique, or makes a therough Inquiry into every thing that's
beautiful and perfelt. The Difference is even to great in every relpett,
that I cannot but wonder at it; especially, when I confider how much
greater the Number of the former Sort is, and how they daily increafe.
Twonder, 1 fay, that now a-days Virtue is to little heeded; Virtue,
which took its Rife from Heaven, is now, as formerly the godly &
Affrea did, flown thither again; and Vice, contrarily, which fprung
forch of 4 Erebys and black Earth, keeps its Station. But it cannot
be otherwife, fince blind Love alone rules, and an (Antero; is no more.
The Reafon of to great a Difference can be attribured to nothing elfe,
but the different inclinations of Painters, to Objects agreeing with their
Tempers.
They, who content themfelves with following defective Life, will
never produce any thing perfect, or deferve the Name of artful Maf
ters; becaule not knowing, or not caring to know, what is beft, they can-
not to much as frive at it: To which add, another Mischief; they
more capity judge of what is bad than good; as I shall explain myfelf in
the following Exampie.
A yeing Man as a Painter with Pallet and Pencils, attended by Zeal,.
is led, by a blind Cupid, to the Figure of Nature, whole Face is co
vered by Vulcan with a Veil. The Sunbehind the young Man enlight-
cas the aforefaid whole Figure. Mercury, on a Cloud, with his Caducent
in one Hand, holds a Star over the Artill's Head in the other. The
Meaning is this.
Nature
Affres, or Werightnets; Sincerity, Love and all heavenly Virtues are underlood by her. She was
the Daughter of one of the Titans and Tbemis, according to Hefiod: Bur Ovif calls her, the Daugh-
ter of Tapiler and Benis. She came from Heaven in the Golden Age, and when Vice and Cor-
suption got fooring, ffew thither again.

Notare is the Painter's Object; the Jan reprefents Knowledge; Vak
can, the gress Part of the fir, or Earthiness; and Mercury, inevi-
Table Fate. The rell explains irfelf. Thus much touching a modern
Painter.
Another Emblem may have this Difference, that intlead of Vulcans
covering the upper Part of Nature with a Veil, Pallar is taking it
off; and Aateres introduced inflead of Cupid. The Meaning is, that
Judgment by Pallx; (which fignifies Wifdem) governs the upper and
moff perfelt Part; and difcovers to the Soulall it needs to know; when
Asteres fignifying Lose to Virtae, is lerding the Painter, attended by
Leal, to it.
But to (peak Hill plainer, we shall fubjoin a third Ordonnance.
We reprefent two roung Men of equal Age; the one flanding on the
Ground before the Figure of Natare; and the other, on one Side, or
behind him, tomewhar raifed on a Stone or Step: By the former is
placed Tylax, and by the lawer, Pallas; the one figaitving Defeft or
Farthy Parts, and the other, the Soul or Perseltion. Let the Figure
of Astare be enlightened by the Sun, and caufe triangular Rays to
proceed from thole young Men's Eyes upon it; the Rays of the for-
mer extend from the Feet up to the middle; and thofe of the latter take
the while Figare. Let us now judge, when the Sun reprefents Know-
fedge, which of the two young Men can fee and comprehend the mgt,
and is moff perfect, he who views the Figure but half-way, of he who
examines it up to the upper Parts. Whence we may learn, that the
Mind and Judgment are beyond the Hand and Praffice, which,
withourt Therry, are of no Worth. Tis Art to produce something which
we bove not in Sight; but mere copying and aping to imitate what we have
before us.
But let us go further, and confider, whether the foregoing Exam-
ple cannot be applied to the Cale of the Lovers of the antique and mo-
dern Manner.
We suppofe then two Lovers inflead of two Painters, and take the
Art of Painting, inlead of Natare, for the Objett; which they, like
the others, view, the one incirely, the other but half way: Thus he,
who comprehends the Figure throughout, knows moft, and has the
beff Knowledge, and is confequently a greater Lover; when the other
is obferved as a Lover of low Things, and ignorant of the more noble:
Of this latter Sort we hnd the greateit Number in our Countries.
Iis a certain Policion, that some Men, tho' hinder’d in their Vouth
by an ordinary Education, from attaining fublime Thoughts and great
Things,


Of Things Antique and Modern.
137
Chap. 3.
Things, can alter in Time by Art and Exercife; even conquer their
innate Difpolitions, and fir themfelves for noble and excellent Things;
to that we need not wonder, that Demofthenes was not more eloquent.
than Demades, who, tho' he feemed as if Nature had not beflowed on
hrim either Tongue or Speech, yet became fo eloquent, that his fin-
gular Example thews, theres nothing impoffible to Art; nay, few De-
fells, which, like Demades, Diligence and Labour cannot overcome.
Do we not read of Heraclides, that he became a Philofepher in (pice
of Narure and Education? Why does Socrates, not prone to Virtue,
become virtuous? Wherefore we need not wonder, that many great
Men have obtained great Endowments, tho' naturally unfit for them:
And from hence we may infer, that Art and Exercife are of more
Worth than the Productions of Nacure.
I have not yet made mention of feveral Men of mean Extraction,
who, tho' they spent many Vears with Pleafure and Affiduity, in low
Imployments, yet afterwards arrived, to general Surprize, at the Top
of their Art; as is faid of Polydere de Caravaggie, who, in Raphaels
Time, having been an Hod-man to his 18th Vear, became afterwards
a great Mafter: The fame was the Cafe of Quintin Marfys, who hav-
ing been, to his 20th Vear, a Smith, gave into Painting, and much
turpalfed his Cotemporaries. Martin Hemskirk, a Country-man's Son,
Andrea Mantegna, a Cow-herd, and many others of mean Birth allo
went great Lengths in the Art.
Was not, among the ancient Philolophers, Protagoras, a Country-
man's Son; Pythagoras, an Engravers; Ipbicrates, General of the 4.
themans, a Taylors; the Orator Demades, aforefaid, a Sailors, and
the Mantuan Maro, Prince of the Latin Poets, the Son of a Potter?
Even the Muses themfelves were poor; their Nobility (prung not from
their Birth but their Science.
We could give many more loflances of this Kind; but, not to feem
redious, shall proceed to

ourfelves obliged, to treat of all Parrs of the Art, in order to be alike
ufeful to every one.
We have already obferved, that there are three Sorts of People,
the courtly or high; the Citizen or Commonalty; and the mean of
poor State; the frft is fpoken of in the foregoing Book of Ordennance;
and the second shall now follow.
We suppofe, that every Arriftendeavours to excel in his Choice of
Subjelt; thar some feek Fame and Money; others, Money and Fame;
others, Money only: At the same Time we think it no less artful, to
reprefent a felt than a ferious Matter; a Countryman, than a Courtier,
or an Ass, than an Horfe, fince either requires good Skill to express it
properly.
Altho’ theres a great Difference between Citizens and Courtiers,
yet the one as well as the other may excel alike in Beauty and Good
nets; Tis Grandeur alone that makes the Diftinction between the City
and Court; for Luxury and Pride are peculiar to the latter, but Mo-
defty and Temperance to the former.
Having premited this, it will be eaty to exhibit plainly, the fur-
ther Circumftances, as Occafion shall call for them; firft obferving,

that as the City-life is peculiar to us, with its daily Occurrences of Af
temblies, Paltimes, Family-affairs, and other Particulars, mentioned
in the preceding Chapter; to tis the more eafy for a Painter to make
fuch Subjects his Practice; especially one who inds himfelf infufficient
for the grand Tafle, for whole Sake we give the following Schemes.
And firtt an
Example of Intreating and Refufing.
Two Virgins are feen at a Table, drinking Tea; the youngell is in
her Within door Dress, and the other, a Friend paying her a Vilt;
each has her Cup and Saucer; that of the youngeff flands filled before
her, and the has the Tea-pot in her Hand, in order to fill the Cup of
the other, who, having turned it down, fets it on the Table; the is
friendly intreated by the other to drink another Dith; as if the faid,-
Pray, dear Ifabell one Diss more; but a Servant entring the Room
to call her away, the refuses it, with her Hand on the Tea-pot, to hin
der filling, feeming to tay, — I thank you beartily; fill no more.
Thefe two Paffions caute two contrary Motions in the whole Body,
Hands, Feet and Face. The Mother, who is letting in the Servant
with his Hat under his Arm, holds the Door half open, and is thew-
ing

ing him his Miftrels; the opening of the Door difcovers a Sledge,
the ufual Carriage of Holland) with which he is come to fetch her.
Now, in order to express more plainly this Rifing from the Tea-ta-
ble, we may place another Virgin at it, near Nabel; who, looking to
wards the Door, feems to rife and fet down her Cup: The Man we
may make approaching his Miflrels, with a Letter in his Hand; and the
Mother, fanding at the Door, and looking: A little Boy may allo
properly fland at the Table, who, ftealing a bir of Sugar out of the
Box, is watching his Sifter, to fee whether the obferves it. Thus the
Matter may fland with respect to thefe two Virgins.
Have we a mind to reprefent the fame. Occurrence by Gentlemen, we
ought only to change the Tea into Wine; the Tea-pot into a Bottle;
the Cups into Glaffes; the Tea-equipage of Ketele, Chafing-dith, Cec.
into a Ciftern, according to the Seafon; and the Mother into a menial
Servant; the Apartment, if in the Summer-feafon, to be in a Gar-
den houle; and, in the Winter, a Chamber, with an Entertainment,
of Collation.
Such Subjects as thefe are very commendable, and may be nobly
difpoted, to the Credit of an Artift: But he mult avoid bandling Cot-
tages, Brandy-shops, Ale houfes, Bawdy-houses, Corps-de-Gard, and the
like.
We shall exhibit another Example of daily Occurrence; whereby
appear more Passions; in order to thew, that they muft not be wanting
in fuch Reprefentations.
EX AMPL E II. Of an Accident which happened at a Painters
House.
The Arciff had one Morning a fine Plaifter figure and two Bults
brought home; and fecting them oue of the way on a Cheft of Draw-
ers, and then paying the Figure maker, let him depart: A Boy of 7
or 8 Vears of Age litting near the Drawers, eating a Piece of Bread
and Butter, faw this; who, after he had eaten, and his Father left
the Room, took a Chair, in order to view them near; and thinking
them Play-things, muft needs take them down: but either thro' their
Weight, or the tottering of the Chair, whereon he food, he dropp’d
the Figure. On this Noife the Father, apprehentive of what had hap
pened, came down into the Room, and beheld the Misfortune with
Sorrow. The Boy affrighted, looked about for a Corner to hide in;
and at laft run to his Mother, hanging about her Neck, and begging
her
S2


145 Of Things Antigue and Moderm Book III.
her to fave him. She, tho' concerned for the Damage yet, defired the
Father to confider the Childs Innocence; upon which, and the Intrea-
ty of his Daughter, who had ruthed into the Room, on hearing the
Outery, he was pacified; ordering the Maid-fervant to gather up the
broken Parts, and to fling them away: After which, he cook the two
Batts in his Arms, and returned to his Room.
Alcho' this Accident be in irfelf of no great Moment, yet it will
furnith Marter enough for a Mode painter, as well as the contrary, to
fill three Cloths with; being full of efficacious Paffions, Elegance and
Variety; and as rich in Subject as if it were a Filtion.
Ir cant be denied, that this Subjelt, tho' no Hiffory, is of an biffo-
rical Astare, and requires as much Pains as the handling some Filti-
ons out of Homer or Firgil. We grant indeed, that the Nature of it
gives us Liberry of adding what Ornaments, or taking away what hea-
vy By-works we pleafe, lince we are Mafters of our own Inventions,
and can manage our Thoughts as we think fit, till we have brought
them to our Liking; which is a Licence not allowable in other Kinds
of Hictory; neverthelets when we have a mind to exhibit an Acci
dent like the preceding, we mult confine curselves to all the Particulars
of ir, tho' no Hiltory; becaute by abaring or leaving out any of them,
I would make no impreftion on us. This Example then, tho' only
an incroduction to fuch Sort of Compofitions, yet requires a punctual
imitation; and we get in time richer in thofe inventions, by daily Oc-
currences. They mult even be pleafant to Painters in the grand Man-
ner, fince they recreace the Mind, require no Reading, and may in
great Numbers be met with at leifure Times. Princes often difquife in
mean Habits for their Diverfion; and Cirizens and the Commonal
ty in rich ones for the fame Reafon; becaufe any Sort of Variety
tickles; and each feeks his Pleafure foreign to his ufual Way of
Living.
But tis more eaty for a Citizen to play a Cirizen's than any other
Part; and for a Painter to keep to the Management of what he daily
meets with, than any Thingelfe; fince the Mind is like a glats Ball hung
up in the middle of a Room, which receives all the Objects prefent,
and retains the impreftion of them. Thus Rubens and Van Dyt, by
daily converting with the Great at Court, were fixing their Thoughts on
what is fublime and lofty in the rt; Fardeans and Rembrandt again,
on what is City-like; and Bambocrie and Broswer, on what is moft vul
gar and mean Thus each in his Way, according to his Converfation
with People like himfelf.

The following Accident is as remarkable as the former.
Ordennance.
This Compofition exhibits a Mother, holding a Looking -glats before
her Child. This Woman fits upright, with her Back moftly againtt
the Light, clofe to a Window, which runs to the Point of Sight, and is
but half feen; thro' which Window the receives her Light a lutle front-
ing; her Drets is a long dark blue upper Garment, and her under one,
having long Sleeves, is light gold Colour with purple Reflexions; with
her lefr Hand the holds the Looking-glats upright in her Lap; looks at
the Child with a Smile, yet her Mouth fomewhat open; her Head, in
Profile, inclines a little to the left Shoulder; herright Iland behind her
reltson a small round Table, whereon lies an open Book, a Frame with
Needle-work, and some Bobbins of Silk. The Child standing before
the Glals, with a Fool's Cap on his Head, holds an Apple againtt his
left Breaft in his right Hand; and has his lefe Arm with a double Fift
up to his Ear; and whimpering threatens to beat the Glass; he turns to
the left, looking angrily at it, and draws back with his right Leg: His
Coat, which is white, is loope on the right Shoulder; and his left Breaft
bare; hes girt with a Rofe-colour Girdle. A Maid-fervant, flanding
behind him, is seen froncing, with her Backfide flanding out fomewhat
to the lefe; her Garment is greyith Violet, with a white Cloth about
her Body; in her left Hand the holds a Key againtt her Breaft, and un-
der her Arm the has a Dulting bruth; her right Hand reftson her Mif
tress's Arm, and with her Head fiung back towards her left Side, laughs
to heartily as to difcover her Teeth; her Hair is tied under a Cap, ex-
cept a black twifted Lock coming over her Bofom on the left Side; her
Smock-fleeves are turned up to her Elbows. Clofe behind the Miflress
hangs a light grey Curtain, moftly shaded by a Pier of the Walling be-
tween the Windows; on which, the Maid gives a large Ground-thade,
which flings off the Child. On the left Side of the Compofition a Door
is seen half open. Forward appears a Cuthion on a Cricket, whereon
lies a Tabby-cat; and by it, some little Flowers or a withered Chaplet.
and a Timbrel.
Now, with respect to this Reprefentation, confider the following.

Observations.
Here is fomething more to be remarked than the innocence of the
Child; he grows angry at feeing himfelf in the Glass, imagining, that
2nother Child, becaute his own Dress is unknown to him, is come to
fright him, and get his Apple. The chief Delign of the Ordonnance
is, to exprets exictly the proper Pallims of each Figure, according
to its Narure and Quality; which not only effectually appear by the
Poftures, but allo by the Dreffes affigned them, and their Colours;
to wir. in the Child, fnnocence; in the Maid, Folly; in the Mother,
Moderation.
Alcho’' this Compoition be no more a Fact than the former, yet it
affects our Paftions as a Truth; and becaufe the Dreffes do not quite
chime in with the Mode, it may, if well painted and executed, hang
better near an astique Hiftory or Fable, than one of a Company of
Gentlemen and Ladies, whoferich Dreffes thine with Gold and Silver.
Moreover the Dreffes varying from the prefent Mode, the Picture will
maintain a Decorum, which will not abace in a Thouland Vears, if the
Circumitances of the By-works be well obferved. By incroducing a
Timbrel inflead of Marbles, Nickers or Cockals, and giving the Maid
2 Dulting-bruth inflead of a Broom or Mop, and placing by the Miftress
an open Book of a Frame of Needle-work, instead of a Spinning-wheel
or Pudding-pan, we shall perceive the childith Simplicity of the firtt,
the Servicude of the second, and the Tutelage of Command of the
third The very Carlying by the dead Flowers on the Cricket, inti-
mates childith Play, and a Fondnets to fcatter all Things about the

ably imploy himself in handling fuch Subjects as the following.
Pifture of Virtue.
She appears fitting compofedly before a large Looking-glats, the
Frame whereof is carved and gilt, and adorned with Montters; the
views herfelf in it, holding a rounded Serpent twined with Laurel; her
Aspelt is fedate, her Sway majeftic; and the's accired like a ROMA:
Near her fland fome Children attentively viewing the Frame, and, with
2 general Laugh, pointing at the Montters. One of thefe Children

wears a Fool's Cap; another has a Neft of Birds; a third has a jingling
Iron; a fourth, a Shell of Water, our of which he blows Bubbles
with a Reed; and a fifth is playing with a Puppet; thefe Children are
partly Boys and partly Girls.
The Senfe of this Table is eafy: But if the Curious want further
Scope, let them confider only, for Inftance, in what a good and bad Fa-
mily confifls, and they will find, that there are four Sorts of People:
Namely, in a good Family, a prudent and respected Facher; a careful
and good -natured Mother; obedient Children; and humble and honeff
Servants: The FathergivesLaw; the Mother enforces it to the Chil-
dren; and both they and the Servants obey: Again, the Father pu-
nithes; the Mother reconciles, and the Children love and fear: A good
Father is alfo liberal in the Support of his Family; the careful Mother
manages with Frugality, yet with Honour: All is in Peace and Order,
and Virtue their Aim.
in a bad Family we contrarily fee the Father careless; the Mother
lavith; the Boys wanton; the Girls pert; and the Servants idling and
dithonelt: The Father indolent; the Mother unreafonably indulgent to
the Children; the Girls fancy and proud; the Boys rampant and game
tome; and the Servants carching at what they can lay hold of, thinking
it beft to fith in troubled Waters, and fealt daily at their Mafters Ex-
pence. Again, thereare other Objects in a divided Family; when the
MMan is pious and the Wifea Worldling we fee frequencly wicked Chil-
dren: Contrarily, a worldly-minded Man and a religious Womanoften
have virtuous Children; the Reafon is plain.
If fuch Things as thefe be well oblerved, they furnith abundance
of Matter, and produce an extraordinary Effeltin any Family-occurren-
ces, in what Condition and on what Occafion foever we confider them;
whether in Prosperiry or Adverfity; great and noble, common or in
the mean State; and as well in their Manners and Carriage as their
Dress: And if thefe Things be well executed, whether in the antique or
the modern Taffe, they are each Way commendable Subjects for an

Representation of Vanity. Plate XX.
This Ordonnance exhibits an Hall, which receives its Light thro' a
large Window on the right Side: Behind againft the Wall flands a Ta-
ble, on which is a large celedial Globe: Acthe Foor of this Globe lies
an open Book: On the left Side of the Point of Sight is feen, thro' a
Door-way going down with Sreps, a Vifto, with Part of a Fountain;
and on the Side which runs to the Point of Sight feveral Vafes and Bults
of famous Heroes: On the left side of the Apartment is a Clofet a
fended to by two Steps, berween two Hand-rails: In the middle of the
Piece forward, we place a round Table, deck’d with all Sorts of Wo.
mens Furniture, as a Looking glats, Boxes, Coc. At the Window are
feen two Children, a Boy and Cirl; the Boy, with a Shell in his Hand,
is leaning on the Frame of the Window, and blowing Bubblesthro' a Reed
of Pipe; the Girl, who is got on a Footffool, supports herfelf on her
right Hand, and, laughing, points with the other at a fiying Bubble:
Upon which, the Boy looks back, holding the Reed or Pipe with his
rishe Hand in the Shell: On the right side of the hindmolf Table Rands
a Philofopher in Study, with a Finger at his Forehead, and holding a
pair of Compaffes on the Globe in his left Hand: By the Clofet, which
is half open, flands anold Woman looking forwards, with her Head
fidling, and rubbing her Hands: By the further Hand rail of the Steps a
Maid fervant is kneeling, and whiping the faid Rail with a Cloth; having
byher, a Box with Sand, a Pot with Water and a fliff Rubbing-bruth:
The Clofer is full of Place: At the round Table forwards fits a young
Lady, dreffing at the Glats; her Bofom is open, and the is loofely dreft in
fine Linnen and Silk; with her left Hand the is bringing a Right fide
Hair-lockover her Bolom, viewing herfelffide ways, and, with herright

covered with a dark green Carpet: The Floor is of Stone and divid
ed into Squares: It may allo be of Wood.
I hallnow, for certain Realons, give the Reader my Thoughts of
the Dilpofition of the Objects in this Ordonnance. Bur firft, he will
much oblige me, if he will pleafe to examine what I have hitherto
said, and thall fay on this Head becaute he will then be enabled to
judge, whether ris impoffible for me, as some imalicioutly report, to
make the Difpolition of an Ordonnance, with the due Actions of the
Figures, and in their proper Places and Colours, according to Rule,
becaute of my want of Sight; for would thefe Men themfelves but
open their Eyes, they would quickly perceive, that Difpolition depends
on politive and certain Reafons.
Firlt I difpofe the Apariment with the immoveable Objects; after thefe,
the Figures; and laftly, the Colourg; whereby 1 affign Regularity. I
shalls er of the moveable Objefts at the fame time as laffert the por
e Plscesof the Window, Tables and Clbiet.
Now I do not fay, on which Side of the Table either right or left
the Lady is fitting; becaufe tis needlels, and the cannot be difpoted
otherwife than the is; fince the Looking-glats mult be placed againft the
Light; confequently the ought to front the Light, that the may fee her-
felt in the Glass; for how could the thew her Breaft fronting, when the
Face is to be in Profile? And were the to bring the Lock of Hair over her
Bofom with her right Hand, and to put the left on the Table, she would
be without Sway, or good Pofture, and from Head to Foot in Profile.
Let us next confider whether the Pbilesopher could be otherwife dif=
posed than where he is; on the left it can no ways be, for two Reafons. I.
Becaute the Globe is on that Side very much in Shade, and therefore
unfit for his Conclations. 2. Becaule he would then be partly in the
Light, and shew almoff the fame Polture as the Lady, where ver ought
to be an Oppofition. Again, were he fanding before the Table, or
Clobe, then we should nerther fee his Motion, nor his Contemplation;
wherefore no Place fuits him better, or is more proper than where he
Rands: By which, this Advantage alfo accrues, that becaute he now
receives more Shade than Light, the Lady thereby gets more Beauty
and Decornm: He can alfo more commodioutly view the Globe, and
make his Remarks by turning his Body; becaule ofe Side is juft front-
ing the Light, and the other contrary to it.
It may be the fame with the old Weman next the Clolet; fince its im
poffible, that the and the reft of the Figures can be otherwile dispoted
with to much dvatttage and Decorum.
No. 7.
This


146 Of Things Antique and Moders. Book III
This Defiga could alfo be well managed in Pountraiture; especially
in a Fumily piece of Man, Wife, Children and a Servant; for we find
daily Occurrences enough agreeing with fuch a Reprefentation.
But to difcourfe clearly on this Compoficion, and to thew, that its
founded on good Reafon, we shall make some further Remarks upon it:
Ifaythen, that it will bear divers increpretations, tho; as will appear
below, they may be brought intoone: The Lady at the Table and the
old Woman at the Clofer both fignify funity; and yet it may poffibly
be faid, that the former may as well be taken for Pride, and the latter
as slanding before the Plate, and, with a finiling Countenance, rubbing
her Hands, naturally exprets Coverousness. The old Man, feen here as
a Philolopher, may confequently lignify Philosephy. But 1 fay, that
this only teems to be fo; becaute, if the Explanation take that Turn, it
cannot be a compendious Emblem, but a confuled Medley of divers

Things, from which no inference can be drawn.
Therefore tis proper to explain our Thoughts of this Composition
thoroughly, even to the fmallelf Objelts, gradually coming forward from
the greatell Diffance.
The Bullos and Fountain in the Offship, as alfo the Servant clean-
ing the Hand rail, tend altogether to Funity; as the old Man with the
Globe reprefents vain Contemplation; for who can penetrate the Secrets
of God and Narure: The Senfe of the young Lady and old Woman
we have explained before: Wherefore the true Meaning of this Subject
is only to thew, that all is Funity; which yet could not be ablolutely con-
cluded from it, were not the Children there; fince the other Figures
and Objects might be divertly applied, to wit, to Pride, Covetoulness,
Philolophy, oc; and therefore the Children, who imploy themfelves
in blowing Bubbles, are now the Soul of the Work; and without them,
there would be neither a Cornexion nor Conclution: Even each Figure
would have a dittint Signiication, and each call for a diffinet Apart-
ment: And tho' we were minded to exhibit different Paffions into the
fame Picture, yet fomething mutt be appropriated to each of them, in
order to thew irs Meaning: For a Picture is not in the fame Cafe with a
Froncispiece plate, wheren is a general Reprefentation of the whole
Subject of the Book, vis. the feven Wonders, the twelve Months,

The aforefaid Delign is alfo not much unlike a true Hiftory; and
might likewife ferve for a Moral or Emblem: Foreach Figure has its
particularand proper Charalter; Men incline to fudy; Women to ga-

ther Ricnes and Goods; Daughters grow up in Luxury; and mif spend

their Times young and innocent Children buty themfelves in Triffes;
to that on the whole, the Conclution muft be, that each Perfon, in what
he inclines to, loves Vunity.
if any one here object, that Affrenemy, Mathematicks and Phileso-
phy are not Vanicies, as being afcribed to wife Men, he mull Know,
that wife Men themfelves are, by  some, accounted Fools; wherefore.
f Pythageras, tho' an Heathen, would not be ftiled wife; but a Friend
and Lover of good Discourfes and Sciences. Knowledge often makes
wife Men prefumptuous, and prevents their confidering; with the Phi
lotopher, that Sciences are Vanity. Thus we lee daily, that the Rich
are haughty and difdainful; the Handfome, proud and voluptuous; tho'
Beauty and Pleafures, like a Morning-ffower, decay with the Evening,
and we may well fay with the Poet, that Voluptuoufness is a Shadow, and
a momentary Delight; and therefore
Peer Creatures
They are, who covet Shadows and tranfient Happiness.
All which Things occur almoft daily; even in one and the same Family;
as we have more largely intimated in the preceding Chapter.
Some perhaps may centure me for incroducing into the aforefaid Ex-
ample fuch a Trifle as a Pair of Sandals, which feem to belong to
the old Woman: But I fay, they are not Trifles, but proper for luch
Women as make Idols of their Houfes, and chule rather to go bare
foot over their Floors than bedaub them, tho' they have their Maids
always at their Elbows with Woollen Cloths to clean after them. But
fince this Satrifice to Neatnels of Houles is here, in Holland, too ob-
vious, we shall urge no further, but, for Peace fake, filently reflect,
Ob! the Vanity of a too spruce Durch Woman: Even the Maid, as depen-
dant on the Miftress, humours her vain Defires; however, fince thofe
serviceable Creatures in their Conditions have likewife fomething, which
thews Vanity, I givethe Servant, in the Example before us, her Corals or
Pearls about her Neck, altho' the were as ugly faced as a Vizard, or like
the Peafants in Latong's Time, when turned into Frogs; for how ordinary
foever thole Women are, they think themfelves handfome, if they have
but a Coral Neck-lace and curled Hair; wherefore tis plain, that fuch
Circumftances are needful, and have, in their Places, a good Effect.

As for the Ordonnance of Dreffes in this Example, Mode- painters may
difpole them as they pleafe, agreeable to their Choice: I have on
ly skerch’d them here, to thew, that we may reprefent a Vanitas as well
in the astigse Manner as in the common Way of Mode-painters.
CHAP. V. Of Dreses.
E need not doubt, whether the Art of Painting were, or
will be, otherwife, than Tis at this Time, with respelt to its
different Choices; becaute from the Beginning, there were
Mele-painters; and as each Climate has its particular Culloms in Dref
fing, to each Nation follows irs own Fathion; whence it appears, that
Ancrint;, as well as nox, Men were of Opinion, that their own was
the beft, without giving any Reaton for it. The Eaffern Nations have
their particular Dress; and the Northern, theirs: Thefe laft prefer
Cloth, Wool and Furs before the tinell and thinnelf Silks of the Eaft;
and thus it fares with all other Dreffis. Each Vation, I lay, whether
Ialians, Spaniards, French, &cc. cheriffes its own Mode; wherefore
tis no Wonder, that Painters follow thofe, which beft fuit their Choice:
neverthelets the Cafe of Art is, in this Particular, like that of Reli-
gion; There is but one trae; the reff are Setts; to that the Dress which
is the met contant, and remains always the same, is alfo the bet. Never-
thelets we leave each Nation to its own Choice.
That the mofers Paintings vary from time to time in Goodness,
and are continually decreating in that Respect, is not to be doubted;
fince we have daily Inftances of it in many, which are full of Mistakes:
But let me ask, whether the Tassun Order, which is the moft fimple
and frong, do not require a good Architelt as well as the Corintbian,
or beft.
The Mode- paintings agree in all Parts with the antique Subjects,
in relation to Art, to wir, in Delign, Difposition, Colouring, Light
and Shade, and By-ornaments, Cer.
An ingenious Alode-painter ought to take Care, not to meddle with
the Ansque, or to mingle the one with the other; for that would be
an unpardonable Miftake; fince he may be fufficiently furnished with
modern Afatter for his Study. Is it not great Folly to introduce foreiga
Words into a Tongue, which is of ittelf copious enough! Why are
the learned Hoeft and Hurgess to famous! Is it not becaufe of the
Force

Chap. 5.
Force and Purity of their Stile? Especially that of Vondel, who there-
fore is jultly called the Dutch Virgil.
We fee daily, how imperfelt and defeltive the Fassion is; each Day
creates an Alteration, and each Mode we think bett, if it get but ge-
neral Approbacion; as may beproved, if we confider, how ridiculous
our Fore-fathers Habits feem in our Eyes, and confequently how much
he would be mocked, who should appear in one of his great Grandfa-
thers; and would he not be thought a Madman? The Cafe is the same,
with refoelt to the old Reprefentation of Dresfes, with their fliff dou
ble Rults, clofe-wailted and pinkt Doublets, Coc. Does any thing
teem more odd to us? And are not fuch old Paintings, tho' well han-
died, much lighted? And what Reafon have we to think, that the
prefent Alode will better pleafe our Succeffors, when we ourfelves even
diflike that of the Vear pall.
Thofe who take to such a Choice are not qualified to handle any
Hiffory of Antiquity: How ridiculous would it be, to dress Qucen Ep-
ber in a ftiff-bodied Gown, bedeck’d with Ribbons, a Ruff about her
Neck, a wide and quilred Petticoat, lacd Ruffies fetting clofe at the
Hands, and a Point of Spain Head dress, inflead of a Diadem, and eve-
ry thing elfe antwerable; and with her, King Abasuerus firting in a
Spanish Leather Chair, with a narrow crowned Hat on his Head, a
Ruff about his Neck, a short Doublet with long Sleeves, and over ir,
a Chort Cloak lined with Fur, wide Breeches with Knee-Knots, canni-
oned Stockings, Rofes in his Shoes, a Spanip Dagger by his Side,
Gloves in his Hand, Coc. and in the Offckip, Hamon in a red Waift
coat with filver Buttons, and a Linnen Pair of Drawers, slanding on
the Ladder with the Hangman, and a Francifian Fryar at the Foot of
it, holding up a Crucifix to him! Would not this be a fine Ordon-
nance! And yet fuch Things happen.
Now if it be asked, whether the Mode-painters, who paint Mar-
Rets, Kirchens, and the like, are not to be reckoned in the Number of
Figure-painters; I fay, they are; to far as they keep to such Subjects;
nay, were they to handle fillitious Stories, or even Parables, which
aretied to no Time; as, of Lazarus and the rich Mun; of the Publi-
can; Prodigal Son, and the like; or any daily Occurrence; fince fuch
Reprefentations are the more affecting, as they thew foreign Dreffes;
and foreign Modes being a Rarity, are not to foon ditliked as our own.
But fuch Painters mutt not meddle with Scriptural Falts, or the
Stories of Ovid, Virgil, and others, which are tred to Time, as I have
before intimated
Vet

Vet fuch is the unaccountable Rafhness of some, that they dare re-
prefent a Sophonisbs incirely in the prefent Mode; Velvet Gown, white
Sattin Petticoar trim’d with gold Laces, laced Ruffies, an Attire of falfe
Hair on her Head, whice Slippers, and in an Apartment hung with
gill Leather, with a Fire in it; and the Floor of Wood, wherein the
Grain and Knots are nicely obterved; the Room furnished with Pluth
Chairs, fringed and bralsnailed; over the Chimney, large Ching
Dithes; and againl the Hangings, Shelves with Tea-furniture; a Par-
fot in a Copper Cage, Coc. Belides a Black feen coming, to prefenther

are not forgot.
Lucretis and Dids they treat in the fame Manner; againtt the Wall
of the Apartment of the latter, hangs a Plan of the dditions to Am.

Thefe Arcifts would feemingly imprets the Hiftories of Plutarch
Lirz, Taortasand fuch Authors, on the Minds of the People, and yet do
it as ridiculoutly as the Poer, who, in order to make his Verfes Known
to the World, laid them on a River running up to a Town, imagining
that on the Papers (wimming thither, it would be taken up and read,
and his Reputation thereby (pread; but growing wer, it funk, and
happened to be taken up by a Mudman, and flung, with the Mud,
into his Barge. Thus the Poet was difappointed.
Ve Artits then, who are willing to improve, weigh well what you
are abour; keep to the Edges of the Water, that, if ye cannot fivim,
ye may not drown; fince he who is fearlets of Danger, often perifhes in

ine, in a Gold Cup: Be informed in Truth; fince your Work, tho'
ever to neatly handled, will not plead your Caule to Advantage with-
out it.
Two Painters meeting on a Time, happened to have Words about
Precedence; Antique, who thought himfelf the wifeft, would take the
upper Hand of Afcfo, without more Ceremony; but Mode, who infift
ed not less on his Honour and Reputation, would not yield to him;
and, being fomewhat younger, and sturdr, punch’d him to violently
in the Breaft, that ther both fell. After they had lain a while, and re-
collected themfelves, Aode began chiding; but Antique faid—What;
will yon not give we tre Precedence ? Rot 1, fays Mode, I am as good as
you; and akat agnity Words? Draw your Swerd, or elfe I will runthis

Knise into your Guts. This Treatment was too grots for the proud
Antiquo; wherefore, full of Rage, he claps his Hand to his Sword,
and the Bartle enfued; which was very fierce and doubtful. All who
faw it food amared, calling out Gentlemen, Holdin, bold in! But to no
Purpofe; for each continued puthing, tho' without Hurt to the other.
One Tuffus happening to approach in the midlt of the Fray, and per-
ceiving they were both his Friends, interpofed his good Offices, and
parted them. When they were fomewhat pacified, Tuffus asked, what
induced them to fight with fuch unequal Weapons; and to rathly to en-
danger their Lives. How, lays Antique, are you the only Man who do
not know, that Modo bas forced and transported abundance of boneft Pro-
ple? Has be not brought the chaft Lucretia and virtuous Sophonista,
under falfe Appearances, from their own Countries to Amtterdam, in order
to make a feft of them? Dent you know how he has subjected the innecent
and pious Fther, with the whole Court of Ahafuerus, to the Tyranny of
the Spaniards ? Mercover be robs me daily, and will not give Place; now,
what think you, have not 1 just Cause of Complaint? Hereupon Tuffus
asked, whether the Quarrel arofe from any Thing but Precedence; but
Mode, unwilling to hear an Antwer, faid in Anger — All that my
Lord lays to my Charge, Irefert on him; how many Things has he stolen
from me? Helmets, Gauntlets, Stays, &cc. Abl have you forgot that
knavish Trick, which has made so much Noife in the Werld, when he con-
jured & Heliodorus, the Churchrobber, out of Judxa, into St. Peters
Church at Rome, with Intention to steal the sacred Treasure in spite of
the Pope? But to cover his Defign, and not to raife Suspicion, in Case of
Miscarriage, he difcovered the Plot to Pope Orban Vill. who instantly be-
ing carried thitber in a Chair, asked the Robber Whether be were not
mistaken? and, Whether he did not know, that ferulalem was meant, not
Rome? Doyou think then, that the bely Father, had be look’d back, and
seen the High-prieft of Jerutalem in the Hely of Holies, weaid have let
that Offender go unpunished? What is your Judgment of this Sample,
should I give Place to Anriquo: Pray, said Jultus, let Reafon then rake
Place. Vet Antique bawled our — Let me have my Buskins and Ro-
man Ceat of Armour which he robbed me of, and I will acquit him of the
rel. To which Mode laid, — Firft reffore me my Great Grand -father's
Helmet and Geat of Mail, which you made a Present of to Kneas, when
he was flying from Dardania; you may keep the Gauntlets: But. Antique

The Life-guards of Thalefris, 2scen of the Amarons The Conclution
of the Matter was this; Tufus advifed, fince neither could reffore a.
ny thing, that they should drink the Queltion, and take Care, for the
ture, not to fieal from each other.
I queftion nor, but the Reader will, by this Story, fufficiently under-
Land my Meaning.
We have formerly afferted, that thofe who daily converfe with
mean and bad People, commonly become like them; as those contra-
rily who keep Company with the well-bred and vircuous, become good.
CHien, Lays Horace, is a fecond Narure; and the Proverb intimates,
Keep Fenck Company, and boneft thou shalf be: He then is happy, who,
having a true senfe of good and bad, chufes the beff and mofl profita-
ble, and governs all he does by that Standard. He, who has accu
ffomed himself to a bad Manner, cannot eafily get rid of it; perhaps
will retain it all his Life: He, contrarily, who gives in to what is
good, will rejelt Evil, becaute tis againtt his inclination
Reafoning thus, tis ealy to apprehend, how beneficial tis for a
Tyro, to inure himself to any fuch fine Things as are proper for his
Study, and to reject the imperfert and unneceffary. Too many Goods, the
famous Bartholet uted to tay, are no Goods.
Here, pray obferve an emblemaric Ordonnance of a Painter de
banched by exceffive Reading of all Soris of unprofitable Books,
in order to thew, that none muft be ufed but fuch as are proper for
his Study; which Sineed affirms, faying, that we ought to fudy few,
but good Books. The Caufe of the aforefaid Painters Diforder may
be alfo atribured o the vaft Quanity of useless Prints, Drowings,
Sc. he confulted; which are as great Enemies to the beft Thought; as an
Excets in Books.
Here is feen an anriqse Table, laid with Boards, in a Painting
Room, and, in the middle of it, a Disss with a Cake in the Shape of
2 Pyramid, and by it a Cup. Four Women are fitting at the Table,
viz Painting, Stataary, Arcbiterture, and the rt of Engraving, each
having her proper Marks of Dillinction. Judgment, leading Beauty
and followed by Virtue, is entring the Room, and approaching the
Table; where they are welcom’d. At which Inflant Prudence is driv-
ing thence fice, reprefented as an hunch-back’d Dwarf, as allo a Chi
mera. The Room is hung with Hiffories, Landskips, Arcbiteffure, and
Prists. Antiquity is fitting in a Niche, holding fome Medals in her
Hand, reprefenting ancient Lyfre. The aforefaid Door, where Judg-
ment, &c. enter, is behind to the left; and Vice, &cc. on the right

Side, are driven forwards out of the Room. The Chimera has Eagtss
Claws,, Dragon’s Wings, a Serpents Tail, long Neck, a. Womans
Head, befet with Serpents, and the Belly full of hanging Teats
Let us then feriouly chule, out of our Collection, the Materials
which will beft serve our Purpose, whether they be Plaifter-figures,
Prints, Drawings, Academy-figures or other Models; rejetting every
thing that's foreign to our Study.
Since we have hitherto (poken of what is Modern, it will not be
amils to make fome short Obtervations on the Antique.
He, who would nmeely follow the Antique, ought to know, that it
contills in thele two Qualities, viz. Beauty and Geodness: Beguty again
lies in a perfect Proportion of the Members; as we have thew’d in the
feventh Chapter of the firft Book; and Goodness in the Grace ariting
from the Motion of the Members; which Motion ought to be free, and
without Exaggeration. Thus much as to the Nudities.
The Draperies, which are well caft, and to adjutted as not to bin-
der the graceful Motions of the Members, are certainly the bett; as we
evidently fee in the Works of Raphael, Pouffin, and some others, who
prattited the Antique.
The Ordonnance, Light, and what elle is requitite in a perfect Piece,
ought all to be most beautifully chosen.
in this Manner we mult allo contider Landskip, Architecture, and
other Embelliffments: All ought to be eitber pure Antique, or intire
Modern.
We shall here fubjoin one other Ordonnance for the Conclution of
this Book.
Ordennance reprefenting a driving away of the Mode, or what is No
dern, from the ntique.
Inlead of Beauty and Virtue, which in the former are led by Judg-
ment, we may introduce here a beautiful and modeff young Virgin, attird
in thin Linnen, which difcovers the Naked; on her Hand fus a Phe-
Rix, and on her Head is a Chaplet of Flowers. Judgment may be
fet off with a gold Fillet or Diadem on its Head, and a Scepter in its
Hand. Instead of deformed Vice, and the Chimera, we may exhibit a
fying young Damfel in a Riffend Gown and high, laced Head dress;
with a fable Tipper about her Neck; her Arm-fleeves full of Lace;
moreover the has Shoes, Stockings and Gloves; and under her Arm is
a Basket of China-ware, and Muhrooms; which, by her rude Mo-
tion,

sion, the is dropping. Pradence is beating her with a Lecking glass;
holding in her other Hand an Arrow cwined with a Serpent. The
aforefaid young Virgin's Chaplet ought to be compoted of small and
evertaking Flowers, viz. Prarmica Aufriaca and Gnaphalium.
The Mushrooms figaify, shert Duration, or fudden Rife and De
CaV.

The Scepter of judgment is a long thin Rod, with a Knob on the
Top.

Colours in a Painting, whether of Figures, Land-
skip, Flowers, Archrelture, 69c. yields a great
Pleafure to the Eye, yet hitherto no one has laid
down folid Rules for doing it with Safety and Cer-

 which, by Prallice, we can, in a Chort Time, retain,
and inculcate to others; as is allo the Divifion or Proportion of the
Members; fince, according to Albert Durer it may be mathemati-
cally demonfiraced. The same may be faid of Lights and Shades, by
means of Perspective. All this may be thoroughly learnt in our
juvenile Vears; but the difpoling of Colours by and over each o
ther, in order to fetch out a good Inion and Harmony, is not, to
this Day, fixed on certain Principles. Meer Chance is herein our on

An cograred, or etch’d Print, beautifully defigned and dispoted, and
apfetably lgtied and shaded, is very commendable; but a Picture,
which betides thofe Qualities, requires an artful Diversity of Colour-
ing, therits the highell Praife.
Nevercheless Mafters have, in their Colouring, their particular
Mianners; one has a faint Manner; another, a dark one; another, a
grey Manner; some have a flaring Manner; others, a muddy one,
Cc. occafioned by their not knowing, that Colours require an orderly
Difpolition; like an ingenious Gardiner, who, in the Production of
choice, beautiful, and large Flowers, confiders what Ground is proper,
and which needs Driness, and which, Moiffure, and what Sorts thrive
beft in each; which require Sun, and which call for Shade; which
want Improvement from Pidgeon’s Dung, and which from Doges
Dung; in order thereby to make a greater Advantage than other Peo-
ple do: In like manner, a Painter, if he makes thorough Inquiries in-
to the Natures and Effects of Colours, and againt what Grounds they
are bet set off, and will bet anfver their Purposes, shall be convinced
that he gains a Point above others. By feeking much is found, and,
notwithttanding any Rubs in the way, we muft renew our Attempts.
How many Artacks have I made on this Secret tere I could make a
Breach in 1t? Had 1 not imitated Hlexander, and cut the Gerdian
Knot, I should have been ftill to feek. I shall now gladly impart to
the Arriff all my Difcoveries and Improvements, and refer it to his
Judgment, whether they be of any Moment.
The Number of the Colours is px; and thefe are divided into trwe
Sorts
The former Sort contains the Tellow, Red and Blse, which are call-
ed capital Colours.
The latter is a mixed Sort, contilting of Green, Purple and Viclet;
thee have the Name of broken Colours.
Whire and Black are not reckoned among the Colours, but rather
Potentials or Efficients; becaute the others cannot have their Effects
without the Help of them.
Thefe Colours have allo their emblematic Significations, and particu
lar Properties.
The White is taken in general for Light; and Black for Darkness.
The Tellow, for Lylre and Glory.
The Red, for Power, or Love.
The Blue, for the Deity.
The Purple, for Autberity and Turifdittion.
The

The Violet, for Subjettion.
The Green, for Servitude.
Qualities
The Colours confidered in themfelves are certain
ties, impercep.
tible, without the interpolition of and laying on a Body; like the Moon,
which could not receive her Light from the Sun, much lets communi-
cate it to us, otherwife than by means of a Body. White is allo that
from which the Golours come forth, and the Body whereby they become
perteptible to us.
in reference to the Art of Painting, the Colours give Life to all
things; without thofe it would be impoffible to diffinguith between
Life and Death, Wood and Stone, Air and Water, Goid and Silver,
nay, Light and Darknels: They have a particular great Power, unit-
ing by their Agreement, separating by their Force and Crudity: Tbey
cause some Things to difappear in thin Air, and force others to appear
out of the Back-grounds.
Their Variety produces the utmoft Charms and Harmony, as well in
Nature as in 4. Picture; especially, when in the latter they are dispoted
by a judicious Hland; for what is more beautiful in a Landskip than an
2zure Sky, green Fields deck’d with a Thouland varioutly-coloured
Flowers, differently-coloured Grounds, this ruffet, or yellow, that, green
or grey, as each requires? Allo the Ornament of the brown Cypress-
tree, the grey Willow, the fair Olive, the white Poplar, the green Al:
der, thered Fir, and joyful Linden, each according to its Nature: Add
to this the Diverfiry of Stone-work; how agreeable feems the Porphy-
1y of Tombs, the Serpentine (ione Obelisks, the white Marble Vales
and Termes ? Even Architecture receives a vall Addition byrthe dif=
ferent Colours of Stones; as when the darkgrey Stone,, Frge-ftone,
whice Marble, and such like, are finely marched and put together; and
the Building within is adorned with red speckled greenith jaiper. Por-
phyry and Marble; in the Niches, Figures, and Balsreleifs furrounded
with Ornaments of Gold, Silver, Copper and Alabaffer; and the Floors
inlaid with all Sorts of coftly Stones; as Lapis Lazuli, Porphyry and
variegated Marble, in order to pleafe the Eyc.
But all depends on an orderty Disposstion.. Tis impottible to effect
any Thing charming, with fuch Coltliness, if thofe Colours be not duly
maich’d, and artfully placed: It is therefore highly neceltary, that the
Arciff Know perfectly their Natures and particular Effects, in. order to
proceed with Certainty; as a good Writer, acquainted with Letters,
beflows his Thoughts on Words only.

As for the Dispastisn, it mult be obferved, that as in an Ordennance of
man; Figares, divided into Groups, one of thee Figures is always the
Primipal, attis which all the reft muft be fubordinate, according to
their Ranks, to tis the fame in the Colours, that they may altogether
produce a good general Harmony Nay, were it necelfary to place the
three capital Colours together, the yellow mult be forward, the red
next, and the blue behind; which will produce a fine Harmony.
The three other Colours may be difpoted in the fame Mianner; when
the Purple is placed forwards, the Violet may be behind it, and the Green
laft, as being the weakeff. Thefe latter Colours are called weak and
broken; becaute they poffets very much the Qualicies of the former;
the purple; for lattance, being produced by a Mixture of Red with Blue;
the Violer the fame; and the Green, of Blue with Fellow.
But tho' each of the Colours have its different Force and Effect,
yer ther do not obserce any particular Rank; or Order; becaule a frong
Colour fomerimes happens to come before a weak one; and the con-
trary, as orcation requires; for were they always to Keep Order,
and the Fellow to be principal, to that the others muft diminith gradu-
ally, there would then be no Difference, but the Effect always one and
the fame; whereas tis here as with an Actor, who fomerimes playsa
King, at others, a God; now, a Man, then a Woman; now a prin
cipal Charalter, then a mute one.
Ver if the principal Part in a Picture, whether thro' Choice or Ne
cefficy, confift of white, light or weak Colours, the Parts about it,
how beautiful foever, will be no Obstruction, if they be but varioutly
and well ordered
Again, if the faid principal Part confift of Fellow, Red, Blue, or
Green, and be thereby fer off, all the other Partsought to be intermix-
ed here and there with small Portions of this firong and predominant
Part, as if they were enamel’d with it; yet in frch Manner, that they
may feem foowe their Origin to the faid ruling Part, and, tho' feparat
ed, yet bare but one Efe:t, and unite the whole; like the great Body of
the Afoon, furrounded with glittering Stars.
This fuffices for the ordering the Colours in general; and yet they
cannor have their full Effelts, or due Decorum, without chuling proper
Barkgreands for ferting them off agreeably; avoiding thote which
create Confution, of are too harth and difcordant. Of the former Sort
are fuch as follow.
Whire fuits on all Forts of dark Grounds, except warm Fellow.
Light Vellow fuits on Purple, Violet, Blue and Green.

Light Blue, or Green, Viclet and Fellow not warm or fiery.
Light Green has a good Effect on Purple, Violes and Blue.
Light Violet has the same on Green and Blue.
On White fuits Black, Violet, Green, and Purple; but not Vellow
or Blne.
On light Vellow fuits Violet, Purple and Green.
On pale Red fuits Green and Blue.
On pale Green fuits Purple, Blue, Vellow and Violet.
On pale Blue fuits dark Vellow, Red and Green.
But were we to lay dark Blue on light Vellow, or the contrary, it
would appear very harth and difagreeable.
There are other Colours which are neither harth nor dilagreeable in
themfelves, and yet appear unpleafant and without Force; as if one
or the other were quite dirty and muddled; fuch are, Purple on Red;
beautiful Redon Fellow; or beautiful Greenon Vellow; Purple on Blue
or Violet; and the contrary; allo White on warm Vellow; and the
contrary; or Red upon Red, or Blue upon Blue; as Experience
teaches.
Touching the Colours which are ufed in reffelting or changeable Silk,
I shall fay this: That with Musk-colour fuirs beft Mafficot, with light
Purple or Violet in the Reffexions; with Afh-colour Blue fuirs yellowilh
Whire, reflected with Rofe-colour; with Orpiment agrees dark Purple
with blue Refiexions; on beautiful Green fuits Rofecolour, with light
blue Reffexions; and with Purple of Violet agrees Naples-yellow, with
Sea-green Reffexions.
But we mult especially obferve, that all refletting or changeable Stuft
keep their own Colour in the Shade, to wit, that of the main Light; tor
we muft not commit the fame Miftake as the old Mafters, who painted
all changeable Draperies with two Colours only; as a yellow changi-
able Stuff, with a blue Reffexion; they made the main Light yellow,
and the Shade blue; and thus they managed all others. Truly a great
Millake, and quite contrary to Narure.
Since we have thus far engaged in the By-colours, and their Effeets
and Harmony; we shall alto treat of thofe which tend in particular to
embellish aLandskip, Hiffory or other Painting.

On Free-fone fuir ail dark Colours, viz. Purple, Violet, Blueand

Ber we mult not ue a Colourof pure Lake and White; nor fingle
light and red Orpiment, without urgent Neceffity, and then very spar
ingly. The Green and Red of one Iint, either in Light or Shade, al.
to diagree, on account of their Harthness; wherefore they muft not
come together.
In a Piece of many or few Figures, which is to hang againt a dark
Ground, or in a thady Place; allo in a Landskip, againtt durk and close
Boscage, Whire has a fine Effect; especially Naples Velow, Red and
light Orpiment, Vermilion and fine light Red.
Again in a light Aparement of whice Marble, or light Free-ftone,
of in a Landskip painted light, clear and full of Sky, Blue, Purple,
Violet, Green and Black have good Effelts; whereas the Colours be-
fore named are, in this Cafe, not only difagreeing, but they alfo fook
veak, and without Strength; except White, which cannot be ufed too
much, fince yis no Colour, and therefore fuits any where, except a.

gainlt Shies.
Nevertheless I do not here affert, that the Eprbelliffiments, in the
aforefaid Pictures, muft confiff only of light and Warm Colours; but
that they be incermixed with some durk and weat anes; and that in
the latter Piltures, where we ule dark and weak Colours for the By-
ornaments, we mult difpofe fome light and warm ofter among them.
Now fome may poffibly think, becaute we place Blue by the other
Colours, that fuch would obftruct the Ofsskip; or that the Lrointains,
which, by reafon of Diftance, are commonly reprefented Blue, would
be damaged by so beautifiul a Spot: But this Doubt may he foon cleared
up, by confidering, thatl do not chufe here all dark Colours; but that
the Offskip wiil thereby in some meature appear mere diffant, faint and
uniting. It is alfo true, that Blue in a Landskip is often harth, and
makes the Painring look flaring; but by the Darknels it bechmes, in this
Cafe, foff, natural and tender.
Befides Blue, I mention alfo Violet, Green, Coc. but my Meaning
thereby is not, that tis indifferent where thofe Colours are placed; as
Blue againft the Blue of the Sky; Green againtt green Trees; Vialet
againft a Violet-ffone, or Ground; or Light againft Light, and Dark.

nets againtt Darknels; for that would be improper; becaute,
is Light and Darknels in a Landskip, to we have always means to
give dark and light Colours their Places.
With a Candle-light, either Within or Without doors, or other
Lights proceeding from Fire, fuit Violet, Purple, Blue, Green, White,
Black, Red, without Exception; thefe being Pieces, in which thofe Co-
lours have an advantageous Effelt, and wherein they predominate on
their proper Grounds; for Vellow and Red are almoft the fame as a
burning Candle; which has a great Effect by Night; as it has none in
the Day-time, becaute the Sun-fhine makes it hardly perceptible.
Now as the two former Piltures confift of flrong Colours, viz. White,
Vellow and Red; and the two larter of Purple, Violet, Blue and Green,
yet thofe of the one Sort may be joined to thofe of the other, in order
to create an agreeable Elixture and Harmony, by placing with the rong
some that are weaker; and the contrary, letting each in its place have
the Matery on its proper Ground.
But I have particularly obferved, that out of the three aforefaid pre-
dominant Colours, others may be temper’d of less Force, viz. brown
Oker with Naples Vellow, Pink with White, and fuch like; and placing
them by the others, as middle Colours, we may, in Conjunction with thote
others, setch out a great Mass; fince White has its Degrees as well as
Red; always obferving, that the principal muft predominate, both in
Force and Beauty; and that chole Colours, which are drawn from it, be
disperted here and there thro' the whole Piece; as being beft set off a-
gainft the general Ground.
Having now plainly thewed the Qualities and Ufes of the Colours,
and their Differences, we may ealily think, that the Pictures, wherein
they are confidered, mult needs be very affecting.
We shall not here fay, what, where, and how one Colour mixed
with another is to appear; becaute tis impoffible and unconceivable:
The principal Method for obtaining this Secret is, to obterve, to robat
Pitch we work up our firft and strengeft Celour, and to let this Colour
predominate; for which Reafon tis a Maxim with some, that we mult
not introduce into a Picture more than one capital Colour, or a Colour
which reprefents it: But I have already shewed, that fireral may in
that Manner be brought together in the same Piece: Wherefore the
Eye and Judgment muft decermine this Point; for if we find it proper
to incroduce a beautiful Colour where we have a mind to place fuch
an one, why should it be bad? This only makes it fo; its being ac-
companied by By-colours, not well ordered; as warm Colours againft

arn, and Grey near Bine; whereby those Colours have no Effed;
of elfe, by placing too ftrong and too many capital Colours by one a-
nether, which overcame the aforefaid beautiful Colour, and make the
Painting look fiaring.
But, that we may not mittake in this Point, let us chule any Colour;
and in order to find an Affociate for it, take one which is difcordant;
as if we puch upon Red, take a Grey one; if dark, a light one, Coc.
Thus they are, as proceeding from each other, joined together; and by
fuch Means we can never be ar a Lots in tinding different Colours for
different Draperies; ver with this Provifo, that in all thofe Colours the
Ferce or Distance of the Figures muft be obferved.
For the ready obtaining thefe Things, I have found out a very eaty
Method, which alwars thewed me the Particularity and Harmony of
the Colours; it even ofien helped me, with Cerrainty, over the Diffi-
culty about the Difference of the Colours in Draperies; especially
tuch as were changeable: Firff I temper’d on my Pallet, out of
my general Mixtures, three particular Colours, viz. one for the main
Light, one for the Half-thade, and one for the Shade: Then I took
Cards, and feverally painted them with one of the aforefaid tem-
pered Colours; when they were dry, I placed and replaced and chifted
them to long as till I had fansned my Judgment: Sometimes, when
this would not antwer my Purpofe, I thuffid them; and then cook a
Parcel from them at random, which, if they happened to pleate,
were my Directors This Method helped me moft in reffecting Drg
feries, which I thereby often produced very advantageous, and of a
fine Colour; it was especially ufeful, when I had any Doubt, whether
fixh or fuch a Colour would fint well with fuch or fuch an one, or
net; for the Cards certainly shewed me the Thing as well as if I
had the Stufts themfelves, and faved me the Trouble of uncertain In
quiries.
It will not be amils, to fay fomething further, touching Back-grounds:
Ir often happens, that a Perfon feesa Colour in a Picture, which feems
to him very agreeable; and yet, on imitating it, he finds his Colour
has not the lame force and Effelt, thro' his not obferving againtt what
Ground that Colour was painted; a Point worthy of the uimofl Atten
sion, if we would avoid Mistakes in Colouring; wherefore we mult al
Ways obferve the Greands and Places of the Colours, if we would have
our Colour predominate; ordering the moft difagreeing againlt it;
for Inttance,
to make the Vellow predominate, place Blue againft it,
or elfe the Darks of other Colours; would you. abats the Force of

in the fame Manner you may handle all the reft of the Colours,
obferving, that, as the Objects diminith by Diftance, to the Colours mult
proportionably be fainter, and gradually more grey; Nature thews it:
And yet I have found, that we may place even a capital Colour in the
Offckip, and it shall be prevented from approaching, by accompanying
it with Colours like it, and drawn originally from it, as we have before
thewed.



CH AP. II. Of the Property, Nature and Colours of Drefes.
7 E have before faid, that the Art of Painting is an Imitation of
Nature in her vifible Pares; nothing is impralticable to it; and
yet observes due Order in all Things; and as we have before
thewed the general Order of the Colours, to we shall now handle it in
particular, with respect to Druperies, wherein it chieffy lies.
Draperies confift of four Kinds of Things, v:2. Linnen, Silks, Stufs and
Clotb; and thefe have each their particular Natures and Manners of
Folds: Their Properties are alfo different; and to thew them by an Ex=
ample, I shall divide the Kinds into the four Times of the Day.
Linnen Draperies are for People in the Morning of their Lives; Silks,
forthole in their Lenith; Stufs, for thofe in the Afternoon, and Cloth,
forthofe in the Evening of their Lives. But to (peak more intelligibly,
there are four particular Conditions of Men, viz. Infuncy, Touth, Man-
hood and old Age; and each provides a Drels according to his Vears;
Children should be dreffed in Linnen; young People, in Silks; full-grown
Men and Women, in Stufs; and old People, in Cloth.
The Colours for the leveral Stages of Life are thefe; for Childhood,
White; for Touth, Green; for Manbood, Red; for old Age, dark Vio-
let; and for Death, Black.
in the firft Chapter we have thewed, that Whire and Black are not
accounted among the Colours; fince the one is but the Parent of Colours,
and the other, the Depriver of them; wherefore we introduce Whire,
25 Light, without which no Colour is vifible.
Dark Fillemot or Tawny shall ferve to repretent the Earth, or Green
nets; White, to thew the Water; Blue, the fir; Red, the Fire; and

Black, the Darkness above the Element of Fire; for there is not any Mat
ter or Either beyond it, which can contain or be penetrated by the Suns
R2PS
Wealfo know, that there are four Seafons, viz. the joysid Spring;
golden Summer; fruitful Hutumn; and melancholy Winter. in the
Spring, we begin to leave off Cloth, or heavy Winter-raiment, and to
wear thin Stafs; Summer and Hurumn permit us to drels, according to
their Heat, either in Linnen or Silk; wherefore a certain Authorlays,
that we cught to suir our Dreffes, as well as our Words, to the Seafon.
The Seafons may be alfoexpreft by Colours; as the Spring, by Green;
Summer by Vellow; Auturn, by Red; and Winter, by Black.
Vet, among the Deiries, there are fome who have atways one proper
Dress and Colour; as Tupiler, a purple Manle; June, a blue Veil;
Disz2, a white and blue Garment; Acprune, a Sea-green one, Cot.
Thefe we cannot alter without committing Miltake: But the Figures
mult neverthelels be ordered, if postible, where they suit best. All brarg
Personages, of either Sex, should likewife be clothed in Red or warm
Fellow.
It therefore behoves a prudent Arcifl to have a perfect Knowledge of
the Narure and Qualiries of the aforenamed Stuffs; even, were the
Figures ever to tmall, he mud notwichllanding thew in his Work, of what
Sort of Stufs the Dreffes contill; and alcho’ Reffexions cannot be well
obferved in small Figures, yet we ought to fee, by the Courfe of the
Folds, whether the Draperies be Silk, Cloth, or other Stults.
A neat Painter in Lictle ought aifo, not only to diftinguith the Thick
nets and Thinnets of his Driperies by their Folds and Corour; but in the
particular Nature and Colour of each Drapery, their Diminutions and
Variations; as between thin and thick silk opposed to Sattin, and more
Iuch; for if the Eye, at tirff Sight, can perceive and diffinguith them,
we ought allo to make them appear what they are; chieffy in fmall
and highly-finithed Pictures; as Abseris and others have artfully done to
fuch a Degree, as plainly to diftinguish between Silver, Pewter, Tin and
polihed lron.
As Becomingness fublists not only, in the Stuffs, but allo, in their
Colours; to, knowing that, we shall not eafily mistake in the Choice
of Colours and Draperies.
Bur I mult here give some Painters an Hint about the Nature of Sruss,
especially coloured ones; they believe, they can paint Sattin after white
Silk, and changeable silk after coloured silk: But this is lame Work;
for

for what in plain Silk is thining in the Light, will often be found quite
dark in Sattin; wherefore in this, Nature muft be confulted.
For thefe Reafons the Eye is pleafed, when in a Painting of a Con-
courfe of People or publick Shew, it can eafily diflinguith all Sorts of
People, and the Conditions and Ages of both Sexes; and at the same
Time their Motions according to their Natures and Qualities, and the
Dreffes and Colours which become them; as, anold Man, heavy and
weak, flanding on both Legs, and fometimes by the Help of a Stick,
becomes a long dark-coloured Cloth Garment, viz. of Umber, dark
Violet, Fillemor, or Black, faftened with Strings or Buckles, and fetting
on him fomewhat negligently. A young Man should appear in a quite
contrary Motion, as being frolickfome, fickle, airy, and standing often
onone Leg; he mult be painted in a mofl beautiful purple, green, red
of yellow Drapery, of light Stuft, or thick Silk, fattened on the Shoul=
der, and not too long, that it may not hinder his continual Motion;
becaule a Man, if full of Fire, loves to have his Legs free. Women
and young Virgins, as being tender, fedate and modeft, are chiefly dif-
ringuithed by their white Garments of thin Linnen, and all Sorts of
airy and womanith coloured Silks, viz. light Blue, Apple-bloffom,
Pearl colour or light Lemon, caft loofly on each other, and in fuch man-
ner that the Beauty of the Naked may eafily appear thro' them; their
Pofture is modeff and fet; their Legs clofe; their Bodies upright; their
Necks bathfully bent; their Arms clole to their Bodies; their Mode
gay; and taking hold of their Garments, which hang down to the
Feet. Children are feen moftly in whice Linnen, or Lemon, blue or
violet-coloured Silk; they are often in white Velts, without any hang-
ing Drapery; but when they have tuch loofe Drapery, a small one;
about a fard in Length, is lufficient, and this faftened on the Shoulder
for Security, while they are running, bultling and rolling on the Ground.
This Condult is, in my Opinion, of great Confequence, tho' few
have obferved it; nay, even fome good Painters oftentimes fail in ir,
making no Difference between manly and womanith Colours; giving an
old Man a femenine Colour, and a manly one to a Woman; intermiking
them as if there were no certain Rules for either: But it muft be grant-
ed, that the Silk-colours, which befit a young, furdy, capricious Mian,
are very difagreeable ro a Virgin, who is tender, weak. more fedate and
lets voluptuous; he requires flrong, the more loff and beautiful Colours,
yielding a Pleafure to the Eyc. It would alfo be very improper to paint
a Child in Black; a young Man in dark brown Colours; a grown Man
in part Colours; and an old Man in beautiful ones.

there appeared Children, running about and playing in the Sand,
all dreff in Linnen habies and foff Colours This Ordonnance vaftly
pleated me, and put me to confider what it could be likened to;
and I find it to be the same as the four Times of the Day; for let us
rake the Children, wheher Boys or Girls, for Day-breat; the young
Men and Women for Noon, when the Sun is at higheft; and the old
People for igts; between Mid-day and Night is Vesper or the Even.
ing, which may be reprefented by joining fomething of both Condi-
tions; allo between Gurory and Midday, the fame; to as to make,
in the whole, a proper Difference between the Conditions and Ages of
Men. Here let us not forger, that old People fometimes affect Wwite,
to thew their becoming Children again; contrarily Black is fometimes
from by young People; as a thin black Veil to fignify fome Sorrow,
or elfe to diftinguith a married Woman from a Marden.

CH AP. III. Of the Colours of Dresfes, and their fuiting with each
other.
5 we are treating of Drosfes, it will be proper to fay fomething
of the fuiring their Colours; I mean what Lining or Furniture

each coloured Garment requires; a Matter of great Moment,
tho' as liicle obferved in Pictures as the Life: Wherefore let it be noted,
firft of the seak Colours.
When the upper Garment is White, the Lining or Undercoat
may be Rofe-colour, Fillemot, Purple, Violet, or beautiful Sea-
green.
WWith a light blue Garment fuits a Furniture of yellowith White,
Violet, dark Fillemor, or dark redith Blue.

A light or pale yellow Carment ought to be furnithed with Viclet,
Sea-green, beautiful Green, dark Fillemot and Purple.
A pale green. Garment mult be fet off with yellowith White, Sky-
colour,, Violet and dark Red.
Now follow the sfirong Colours, and their proper Mixtures.
A Lemon colour Garment may be furnished with Sea-green, Violet,
and dark Fillemot.
A Garment of red Orpiment colour fuits a Furniture of Violet,
sky and greenith Blue, Musk and Umbercolours
A Sky-colour blue Garment may be adorned with Rofe-colour, yel-
lowith Whice, pale Vellow and light beautiful Green.
A Filiemot-coloured Garment may be furnished with pale Vellow,.
Rofe-colour, light Afh-colour, Violer, dark Purple, and dark Green.
All these Colours reverfed have the same Effects.
Here let it be obferved what I mean by the Word (Furniture); Tis
an Adorument, or fetting of; as when a large Drapery of a plain Co
lour is adorned with one or mere small ones, whether a Veil, Girdle or
Sleeve-facing, under Garment, or Breaft-cloth; this Furniture is er
ther of changeable Silk, or of party-coloured Stufts, when tis to fet
off a large and plain-coloured Drapery; and the contrary the fame;
as when the large Drapery is changeable, the fmall Furniture ought to
be of a fingle Colour.
For further Sarisfaction I shall fubjoin an Inftruction of what colour-
ed Stuffs may be beft adorned with Gold, whether flower’d, leafd or.
Rrip’d.
On a green Ground fuit Flowers.
On = purple and violet, narrow Spriss or Stripes.
On Musk-colour, clofe and large Flowers or Leaves.
On Rofe-colour, Apple-bloffom and white thin Silk, fuit Stripes.
Purple, Fillemor, Musk-colour and Whire ato look well with.
Fringes, either feanty or full, according to the Subltance of the Stuft.
It muft be obferved, that what I have hitherto faid of the ordering
of the Colours, is not to concern a single Figare only, but to forve any Oc
casson by a diffufive and agreeable Intermixture: Nor do 1 mean, that,
among feveral Figures, there mult be but one with a fingle coloured
Garment; and the relt, of changeable or broken Colours; for when
they are feparate, and the Draperies large, each in particular is to be.
fet off in the Manner I have before laid down; for latlance, If all the
imall Draperies were feparated from the large one, and we dreit as many
Figures in them, then each muft he further adorned with ocher small

Draperies, of Colours fuiting with it, in fuch Manner as the large one
was before. In a Word, if we only confider, that a fingle Colour
ought to be incermixed with a changeable one, and a changeable Colour,
with a fingle ors, we shall perceive what Order this Affair requires, in
order to look decorous, and pleate the Eyc.
Bur, for further Explanation, I shall give two Examples of it. The
fird 1s, a Company of fre or fix aged People, either without or with-
in doors: Now if thefe Figures mult be all dreft, it requires no Art,
nor is it a Signot Knowledge, to give each a fingle-coloured and equally
large Drapery, altho' we might find as many different Colours, in order
to join them agreeably; and this, for two Reafons; firft, becaute, that
cannot Pappen in the Life without Premeditation. And secondly, becaute
the Figures may not seen to be emblematic; for tho' to the twelve Apoples
are appropriated their particular Colours, yet we mult not infer from
thence, that, if they were all affembled together, we ought to give them
2ingle Colourfrom Top to Toe; becaute, tho' we break the Colours,
tsey yer regain the same; as Blue, with green Reffexion, remains Blue;
Fellow, with Purple, remains Fellow; and fo of others. Our fecond
Example is, a wanton Meeting of yoing Men and Girls, modithly
dred according to their Years; thefe are skipping about, and playing in
2 Fieldor Room: Now ie would not be at all proper to join all their
Dreffes of broken Colours rogether, tho' they were coupled in such Ors
deras they require; and for the former Reafon; namely, that it can
hever happen but thro' Premedication and Necellity: And tho' it would
appear elegant and pleating, yet not at all artful without an Intermisture
of some single coloured Drageries. Nevertheless we find many do it; or
ther, becaufe they take no Delight in changeable Draperies; or elfe be-
caufe ther cannor paint them, and therefore make thift with broken
Colours. Again, there are others who have no Value forfingle Colours,
and therefore, on all Occations, introduce changeable or broken ones.
We have allo met with a chird Sort, who do not know how to make a
Difference between a changeable Stuff and a broken Colour; tho' its
certain, that a reffeeting or changeable Drapery is an Intermixture of
two of more Colours, and a broken coloured Drapery, but of two; as
Violet, with Red and Blue; Green, with Vellow and Blue, Coc.
whence they are called broken or mixed Colours.
In the firff Chapter, treating of this Management, we have fpoken
of refleiting or changeable Draperies; and as we are now again embark-
ed in the same Subjet, it will not be amils to explain the Matter
further.

Mary fancy, they make a good reftelling Drapery, when is well
folded, and different in Colour in the main Lights, greateff Shades and
Reffections; even Rapbact and other great Mafters have been mistaken
in fo doing; whereas a good changeable Drapery ought to draw irs
Refettions from the Colour of which the main Light sonfiffs; the Shade
likewife proceeds from the ruling Colour, yet has fome Tintture of the
Changeablencts: And altho' the Drapery be changeable, yet it has a
conflant Groundcolour of the main Woof of the Silk: Thus Tis a
wtual Expreftion, — A Green and Tellow changeable: This then is
the true Quality of a reflelting Silk, that all that is seen frenting on the
Relief keeps its main Colour, but the Sides of the Folds going of.
cause the Changeableness; which we may eatily perceive on laying a
changeable Stuff fmooth on a Table or Floor; for viewing it perpen-
dicularly from above, it will then appear red or yellow; but if feen
parallel along the Stuff, often appear blue: Whence it follows, as we
affirm, that only the Folds which go of become changeable, and alter in
Colour; when the others, in the main Light and Shade keep their own
Colours: gain, what in one Stuff changes red, will in another ap-
pear green or yellow, according to the Woof or Warp.
By Reafon of fuch Accidents, we are obliged to have Pieces of par
ticular Stuffs, in order to thew the Difference; which cannot be learnt by
Heart, becaufe of the Nicety of the Matter.
We have faid, in the foregoing Chapter, that in an Ordonnance of
many Figures, we ought to obferve the Sexes, Ages and Conditions of
People, and that each muft have his proper Stuff; the Golden fuits Dei-
ties, and thofe who are deified; Purple becomes Princes; thus each,
down to the Slave: Now, to thofe of weak Memories, I shall thew a
good Method for their becoming Mafters of this Point in a Chort Time.
Set down in your Pocker book, the following Heads or Titles; old
Men and Matrons; married Men and Women; young Men and Maidens;
Boys, Girts and young Children: Place thele Titles under one another;
and write againtt them the proper Dress, Sruff and Colour of each Sex
and Condition: Thefe Notesyou mult often confult, and especially when
jou are about an Ordennance of few or many Figures.
Voumay allo make a Column for the Colours of Draperies; fetting
them down under one another; as White, Vellow, Blue, Green, Red,
C5c. and againtt them write their Linings and Ornaments, as I have be
fore mentioned.

spell to Colours; not as if they were unknown of not obferved by in
geaious Artifts, but becaute they are ofcentimes neglected and flighted,
either thro' Carelessness, Prepoffeffion of an Opinion that they need
not be to strictly confined; or elfe, becaute beautiful Colours are moft
pleating to People, and therefore they muft especially facisty the Eye;
withos reflelting, that they thereby injure the Art and their own
Reputarions: Such Painters are like great Talkers, who fay little to
the Purpofe.
Truly, the Colours have great Efficacy, when well ordered and fuit-
ed but they raife an Averion when unskilfully and confuledly dif
poted.
An ingenuous Perfon will undoubtedly agree with me, that there are
purticuler Characters which diftinguith one Man from another a Prince
from an Officer; an Officer, from a vulgar Perfon; a rich Man, from
a poor one; By what means then is this Difference perceived ? Is it
not by his authoritative Countenance, Grandeur and Stately Carriage,
and by his Garb longer and of more coftly Stuff and Beauty than the
others; If fo, it will be eafy to apprehend, that, tho' fuch a Perton
were nor endowed with all the aforetaid Qualities, but with the con
Irarr, he ought neverthelets to be made known by fomething or other
as we have thewed in treating of Ordennance Wherefore tis needless
to fay anr thing further in this Matter, to bring us to the prefent Point
touching the Coisars; namely, to thew on what Occafions they ought to
be uted trastifuly, and on what, not; for which Purpofe I shall ex-
hibit teres principal Occurrences, as Examples, whence we may deduce
and order all others.
The firft may be a Council, or a Triumph, or fuch like; wherein
all the Dreffes ought to appear incirely of the moft magniticent, rich
and beautiful Stufts.
in the second, contilling of Bucchanals, Country-merry-makings and
Herefmens Sports, the Colours ought to be half beautiful and half
Droken, each agreeable to the Condition of the Parties And
in the third, being publick Sigbts, viz. Pleadings, Mountebanks,
Tugghrs, Merry-andrews, and fuch like, made up of common and
mean People, coarfe Stufts and dirty Colours ought to be moft vi
1i3le.
Now here is shill to be remarked, that in the one Sort of Colours
as well as the other, the moft beautiful excels; and as thofe three Oc-
carrences are not common, I muft lay, that among the meaneft as well
as the bert there are some which have the Preference; among the

beautiful are some more beautiful; and among the mean, meaner
ones. Thus much as to Colours, in order to Know a good Malter.
But ere we finith this Chapter, let us obferve, in what Parts the co-
loured Stufts appear most beautiful; fince Stufts are very different in
this Relpect, and have their divers proper Beauties.
We lay then, that black Stufs are moft beautiful in their srongeft
Shades; White, Tellow and Red in their main and greateff Light; and
Blue, Green and Purple in the Half Tints. But all Stufts, not having
a Gloss, ought to be much more beautiful in their Lights, than their
Shades; becaute Light gives Life, and makes the Quality of the Co-
lours appear, when contrarily Sbades obfcure and extinguith their Beau-
ty; contequently all Objects will thew their natural Colours better,
when their Surfaces are less smooth and even; as we fee in Cloths, Lin-
nen, Leaves and Herbs, which are rough or hairy; in which no Glols
or Shining can appear, becaule they cannot receive the Reffexions of
neighbouring Objects, but thew only their true and natural Colour un-
mixed nor tinged with that of any other Object, except the Redness of
the Sun, when, by his fetting, he makes the Clouds and Horizon par-
take of his Colour.
CHAT. IV. Of the Disposstion of Shady Objects, either diffant or
near, against a light Ground.
1GH T againfl Light, and Shade againft Shade naturally unite.
Againtl a light Ground fuit well dark Figures, and againtt a
dark Ground, light ones, in order that they may be ttrongly
fet off; however, the fecring off of Objects either much, little or less,
on the firft, fecond and third Grounds certainly differs very much.
Now it may be asked, when a parcel of Figures, flanding or fitting,
have a white Back-ground, and appear, fome far from, others near, o
thers againll it, whether dark Colours would not be proper in all the
three Groups? I fay, they would; but then they ought to be confider-
ed in another Manner; for, without intermixing some of them with
light Colours, they could not fubfift; wherefore tis necellary, to give
tome more, others lets Force; the Figures clofe to the white Ground
ought to be mixed with light Colours, in order to flick to the Light,
and to break the lets their Force; and yet the dark Colours will pre-
dominate, the light ones being only, as 1 fay, to have Communicati-

on with the white Ground, thereby to keep their Diffance, and to w-
nite with the great Light of the back Ground. The Figures, on the
frond Ground, which came more forward, ought again to have less
tgbt Celoars; and the Group, on the fore Ground, the leaf; whereby
they have lets Comminication with the whice Ground, and confequent-
ly more Force againtt it.
Tis the fame with Light againtt Darknets; for we can eafily per-
ceire, thar Whice and Black never approsch each other without Parti-
apation. The more Black is mixed with Whire, the more it inclines
to Whire; like a large and thick Felloon, mottly light, placed againt
a dark Ground: Now, if vou would have this Feftoon appear clote to
the Wall for tis not with Nature as with a Picture) you muft needs
ule in it some dark Flowers and Leaves, ordering them about the Ex-
gremitr, the mot Whire or Light to be in the Parts myt relieved
darkening it gradually cowards the two Excremities nearet the Ground,
whereby the one kicks to the other and unites; remaining yet a light
Feresx, the intermix’d with Dartncis. Tis the fame with a dark
Festoon againft a light Ground; the dark Flowers being in the middle,
and gradually diminith on each Side. Tis certain, that it will not thow
tich Decorum and Relef, tho' its Shade be in Proportion as flrong 2s
that of the former: Ver tis oaly to be uted in cafe of Neceffity,
when the Marter and Condirion of the Place require it; wherefore we
muff accommodace ourtelves to all Exigencies.
This Erfelt is not only proper for Flowers, but alfo for Fruits, Or-
nathents, C. Eren all kinds of Gold and Silver Ornaments may
with Elegance be joined together by the Colours, after the fame
Manner.
Now follows an Example, in Plite XKl. dispoted after the afore-
said Manner. Here, on the fore Ground appear five Figures of Men
and Women againit a white buck Ground; the three middle ones, clofe
together, are dark and slrong, and the two on either Side, of a litrle
lighter Colour, whereby the Croup keeps an agreeable Relief and U.
ion on the Extremity. On a more diftant Ground fland two other Fr-
gures, of which the foremoft is dark, and the other, half behind the
former, lght; yer both of less Strength than the foremoit Croup.
The lail four, flanding clofe againt the Ground, differ Hill much from
the others, as being here and there intermixed with more Light;
one having a whire Stomacher; another a white Cloth on her Head;
this having Flowers; that with light Hair; another with a white Pot,

light Drapery, Nudity, Coc. which Licdeneffes notwichflanding have
not to much Force as to enlighten the whole Croup..
The Doltrine of Harmony, teaches, that we muft always place
Darkness againtt Light; and the contrary; but this is only a Medium,
thewing, agreeable to that Polition, how and in what Manner Light
and Durknets may appear either clofe together or diffant, like the a-
forefaid Feffoons; but it mult not be confidered otherwife than as. a
Purt of a Pifture. If we would have a perfelt Ordonnance, we can
order, at pleafure, fuch dark Figures as thole, againtt light Grounds;
and the contrary; for Inftance, would you have, on the right Side, of
the Piece, a dark Buth; in the middle, a Viflo; and on the other
Side, Houfes or Stone-work, neither light nor dark; you may place a
gaintt the Buth, light Figures or other Objects, and in the middle, a
gaintt the Oftship, dark ones, and againtt the Houfes, others again
which fuir beft; execute each correctly, and in particular, according to
the said Examples, and then nothing will be wanting that concerns
the Tines: The Colours joined to it make the Work compleat.
I think I have fully explained this Point of Darkness againtt Light,
and the contrary; yet feveral Things ferving my Purpole Hill occure
ring to me, which were forgor in the firft Chapter, 1 judge them plo=
per to be mentioned here. I fay then, that all light Colours, cith
were they broke, appear well againtt a dark Ground, but not with
tuch a Force as the flrong ones; as we have formerly faid, that witen
Colours appear beft on a faint Ground, and the coptrary, whether
they be light or dark. Tis allo a conflant Rule, that the ftrob Co
lours, as light Red and light Vellow, do not fiuit on a ligth of hird
Ground, more than beautiful Blue on a dark one, tho' reckoned a eat
pital Colour.

But let us return to our Example; we have hitherto only ipoken
of the Tints, or Light and Darkness, it will now be necelfary to
thew alfo the Colours of the Dreffes, according to their Order, Place
and Power.

to Toe. Confule the Skerch, and remember their Draperies (one
large, another fmall, of broken and faint Colours) with which they
Ire intermixed, and fuit the Ground; as we have already intimated,
that (in order to form great Maffes of capital Colours, viz. Vellow,
Red or Blue, and they to predominate in an Ordonnance) we may
enlarge or break such a strong Part with Mixtures of the same; as red
Gniment with brown Oker, Umber, or tuch like, which nevertbeless

CHAP. V. Of the Harmany of Colours.
HEY, who are converfant with Books, are fentible that few
Authors have written of the Harmony of Colours; and what
they have done is to obicure and unintelligible, that I shall en-
deavour to make the Point clear.
Ir muit be granted, that in every Part of the Art Narure is our
Pattern, fince the difpofes herfelf in the moft perfelt Manner. If we
at any time difcover fomething fine and pleafing in her, (which we

and Decorum, we ought to confult the Rules of Difpofition and Her-

Means we shall foon apprehend what Decorum is, and on what Rea-

Harmony proceeds from placing faint Colours againft Rrong ones)
and the contrary; wherein fuch an Union appears, that the one
seems naturally to flow from the other, as in this Inftance: Let
us fuppofe an Ordonnance to be divided into three Grounds, or Di-
ftances; place the principal Figures in the middle on the Fore-ground,
and let lome of them be firongly coloured, and the whole Croup as
Rrongly fiung off by a shady hollow Rock coming behind them; place
to the Right, on the second Ground, some Figures beautifully coloured,
yet a Tint darker than thofe on the Fore ground; and behind them,
an airy, greyith-green Buth; and further on, a light Offskip, filled
here and there with fmall Trees: Let this Buth be a Tint darker than
the second Groundfigures; on the left side of which Ground, place
other Figures, as of Girls and young Children, in faint colour’d Dras
peries, which, tho' coming againtt light Buildings and the blue Sky
of the Offskip, will notwithflanding appear beautful and harmonious:
Now, in fuch a Difpofition, we are enabled to perceive hew each of
the three Parts keeps its Diftance by the Nature of the Ground bebind
d
it. The foremolt, as the ftrongelt, and confifting moftly of Light, ap
proaches with Force againt the greateff Shade; and thofe on each
Side, tho' almoft as light, yet are limitted by their buck Grounds,
which differ but one Tint from them; whereby they appear nelitferi
further nor nearer than they really are: From all which Premifes nre
may plainly perceive, that granting these three Parts, or Croups, had
a like Strength and Colour, yet they may, by means of their back.

Ir Eex off, by a darn and warm Fellow Drapery againtt the aforefaid
Hollow, than the Blue Garment of the hindermoff flying Figure, and

tew than the Boats Head and Timbers which have the greateft Force,
as beingi he greatel Part doubled by the Reffexion in the Water: On
the River-fide, againt the Trees, are feen other Figures, (partly naked



and in fine-colour’d Draperies, ciz. Apple-bloffom, light Changeable
ntr
and Whire, nermixed here and there with Vellow) and their Re-
8
MESOs, and that of the Green of the Trees in the Water: Now thofe
Figurer, tho' frin and light, are, in their Diminition of Force, in
the lame Degree with the middle rlying Figure, as having the fame
tair
Dillance, and being of the Jame Narure, and compoted of broken
Colours: So allo the Red of the foremoll fiving Figure agrees with the
Fellow of the Boat, bock being nrong Colours: The Rowers are in
Cark Blse.
Tho' this Example funiciencly enables us to manage any Ordonnance

whatoever, ver I mean not that there muft be always forwards a yel

of this gill Boat, a red one; and give the fore ffying Figure, intlead

of a Red, a vellow Draperv, affigning to each a proper back Ground.
Alcho' the Fellow of the Boar, and the Red Garment of the Figure
are frong Colous, yer ther are diftinct in Narare; for as the Vellow

than the Fellow, in order to be fiung on. Again, if inflead of the

Kanks, (the ftrongiones forward, and the weaker, in Degrees of Dit
tance, according to their Natures) only to thew the Method of placing
them; in a Word, Whether they are to approach, because of their no
tural Strength, or to retive by reason of their natural Weakness.
But it's fcarce posfible, that in any Subject all the Colours should,
according to their Natures, happen to fall to advantageoutly, and there
fore we may, on any Occafion, alter them; for Inftance, if, inflead of
the gilt Boat, we were to introduce a Piece of white Marble, adorned
with Mouldings and Balsrelicfs, and flrongly lighted; the Vifto behind,
turned into a clole Ground, and the Trees behind the Stone-work, in
Read of greyith, more fentible, warm and approaching; this Stone, I
fay, would have the fame Effect as the Boat, and come forward with
Force, tho' Whire, we all know, is not to frong a Colour as Vellow:
Forherein it will happen as in a Camp, where, in the Generals Ab-
fence, the Lieutenant general commands; and in a Company, the Lieu-
ignant for the Captain, and the Enlign for him; even the Serjeant is not
without his Power; therefore when ttrong-natured Colours are not in
a Pilture, the weaker tupply their Places, in a greater or lets Degree as
the Matter requires; wheren lies the Crisss of the Management: Let
me add to this inftance of the white Stone-work, that it muft be the
Rrongelt and moft carching Object in the whole Ordonnance, and that
no Arong Objects muft come near it, to leffen its Force, or kill it, unlets
they be weakened, and brought down either by Miftiness, or by means
of their Back-grounds; whereby they may then have no more Force than
& braken Golour.
CHAP. VI. Of the Disposstion of irregular Objects; and Light a-
gaint Darkness; and the contrary.

I E placing and ordering of Objects is of great moment; for if,
after we have choien them all moft beaunful, we difpote them
careletly, they will abace of their Luftre; again, a good Dit-
polition will make an Object, tho' unelegant in itfelf, look agreeable.

i
to give some Examples of it, I thall begin with Place KXIIl.
On the Fore-ground, on the right Side, is lying an overfet Pot a-
gaintl a large Stone, and both of them frong and warm in the Light,
againtt the Darknels of some high Trees which are on the second Ground.
On the third Ground, lower and by the Waterfide, rifes a column’d

is alllight, chiefly about the Figures.
This Sketch thews as the Irregularity of Objects in an Ordonnance,
and how we ought to difpose them according to Art; some bigh, others
low; together with their Force, in orderto create a diverfified Decorum,
By Objects I mean both the moreable and immoveable, viz. Men, Cat-
tle, Birds, Trees, Hills, Buildings, Csc. as well horizontal, as falling
back behind each other.
As to Force, it confifts in Light againft Darknels; and the contrary;
for (except by the Diverficy of Colour) there is no other way than this,
to fet off Objects againft one another.
We have faid, that the three fore-ground Figures are flrongly colour.
ed, and come againft the faint Offskip; whereby 1 thew, that in one
Piece there ought not to be two Lights on the same Ground, alcho' they
are both frongly fet off, burthar one Part mult confiff of frong Light,
and the other of Darkness. Ies allo eaty to conceive, that the three
Figures, becaute they come againtt the light Offskip and not into Shade,
mult needs require dark Colours: Contrarily, the Pot and Stone are fer
off againt the dark Trees, by a general Rule, that when there are some
bigbr Objects on one side of the Compolition, thofe on the other should
be durk.
Let us now view a second Example in Plate XXIV. as being an Ob
fervation depending on the former, feeing neither can fublift without
the other. This rends to illuftrate the Management of Lights, boch.
above, on euch Side, and bebind one anotber and that we ought always
to order after fuch a Manner; when the former Example shew us the
Irreculariry of Objetts in their high and low Disposstion.
The forward firting Figures are, with the firff Ground dark, as be
ing thaded by a driving Cloud; to alfo is the walking Figure thm to
its Middle. The Building on the second Ground fronts the Light, to
gether with the two flanding Figures, which are fet off by the dark
side of the Houte. The three hindmoft Figures are in the Shade of
the fame Building, againft the Sky; which is their Ground. The
Colums

gainfl the hindmoft Trees, which run to the Point of Sight. The
Man is half again in the Light againft the dark Column; and his under
Parts, (which with the firft Ground are dark) are fet off againtt the
second Ground, which is light.
But tis not fufficient to place here or there a Ground shade; we mult
alfo thew the Occation of it, that it may not be asked, what cauted it;
for all Shades are not alike; fome are more dark, others more clear;
moreover, they differ alfo sometimes in Colour; wherefore it will not
be amils to fay fomething of it here, tho' we shall treat of it more at
large in it's Place.
The Groundshade of Trees often appears less of more Green, accord
ing to their Tranfparency or Clofenels The Ground-shade cauted by
driving Clouds is faime, and has no other Colour than that of the Airbe-
tween. The Ground-fhade of a red, green or blue frerched Curtain
is allo of the fame Colour. Thofe of an Houfe or other heavy Piece of
Stone-work are grey and dark, Coc. But to return to our Subject.
les plain, that what is demonftrated in thefe two Examples, touching
Light and Darkness above, on each Side, and behind one another, is the
same when reverfed; namely, if that which is now Dark were Light; and
the Light, Dark. les alfo indubirable, that if one of the Lights were
taken away, the Ordonnance and agreeable Harmony would be fpoiled
at once; even to much, as not to be brought right again without a general
Alceration; for Inftance, fuppole the walking Perion were dark above,
how could he be fet off by the Column: Since we have before faid, that
Darknels againft Darkness is improper; and were the Column to be
Light, how should we manage the Sky ? And if the Sky were Dark be-
hind the Column, that would be as bad again; for the whole fore
Ground and all upon it are dark; and the fecond Ground is light again;
wherefore every Thing would be in Diforder and indecorous: From thefe
Premifes we may planly perceive, that this is a conflant Method for
Management: And when a good Difpolition of the Colours, according
to their Qualicies, is joined to it (for we know, tharObjects have various
Colours, of which we can chule the moft proper) the Decorum will fill
be the greater, and the Eye more pleated: Trees, tho' they appear
always green, are yet diverfified according to the Seaion, and their Na-
tures: Some are Sea-green, others deep Green, this Rullet, that Grey-
green, thefe again light Green, others dark Green: Groands likewife
differ, as Hilly, Sandy, Clayith and Muddy: Stones do the same: All
which, we have fully shewed in the firft Chapter of this Book. As for

But let him especially observe, that in any Ordonnance, whether of
Hiffory, Landskip or any other Branch, one Side maft be contrary to
the other, not only in Light and Shade, but allo in Height and
Dench.
The Defigns of thefe two Examples are not much unlike that in the
foregoing Chapter; yer here is greater Variety; for the former was,
of the Force of Objects, either dark or light, againit contrary Grounds;
hereas thefe, tho' grounded on the fame Obtervation, thew us how
they are to be ordered above one another, when it to falls out: For In-
ftance, we fee a Group of Figures on the fore Ground, againll another
on the second Groand, fomewhat higher; and that, againtt another silf
Ligher; and to on, to the Cieling or Sky: We have thewed, in Chap.
4 how we ought to let off Objects behing one another, and to unite
them with the Ground; but thefe Examples reach, firft, how light and
dark Objects 1bovs on: another ought to be managed; to as to ferve each

other, and that each may keep ir's Dillance. Secondly, How, for want
of Shade, we mult make thife wirh the 4fylance of Colours. Lattly,
How irregular Objects ought to be placed againtt each other; which is
the Soul and Life of an Ordonnance, especially where there are many
People. Bur Tis not confined to human Fioures; for it respects all Sorts
of Objects, whether Grounds, Hills, Balluftrades, Bartlements, Win-
dows, Roofs, Clouds and Sky; in fine, every thing we can fee rife be
hind any Thing elle, whereon People can appear. Speaking of Clouds,
it mult be obterved, that we may reprefent Figures fying in the Air
and littingon Clouds, in the fame Manner as on the Earth; a Marter
of principal Concern on fuch an Occafion, where the major Part of the
Objelts contills of Height, and many are at a Loss in the different Lights,
Colours and Tinrs. Wherefore, docible Arcifts! Regard this as an in-
fallible Rule, and confider every Thing which I have laid down in the
aforetaid Examples, to prevent your falling into the Miltakes which
are herein nlually commired.
I thall now fubjoin a third Skeich, Plate XXV. touching the Crefing
and Geing off of Objects, as a Sequel of the two preceding.
See in this Example, a Boat going off againt a crols Height, or
earthern Wall, whereon divers People are leaning by one another; who,
with the Trees riting behind, break the Regulariry of the Wall: The
approaching Figures appear again againt the Offskip, which runs acrols.

The Boal is in a flrong Light againtt the shady Wall, which ende in
the middle of the Piece; where the foremoff approaching Figures are
fee off with Light both againft it and the hindward dark Figures, which
have their Effelt again againtt the Light of the Buildings in the Offskip.
The Sky on the right Side of the Piece abounds with heavy hanging
Clouds; and on the other Side are none, or very small ones.
Here we perceive, firff, a great Motion in the Dilpolition of the Ob-
jects; which cross each other up to the Horizon onone Side; and on the
other, the contrary; which caules an agreeable Variety; especially, as
there are some Objects going off, which thew the Point of Sight: The
second Obfervation is, the Harmony of Light and Sbaile, as in the for-
mer Examples.
This Examplethen thews, what Methods we may take, in order to
fetch out fuch Esfelts; and Tis for that Reafon, that this Point is ex-
hibited feverally, and in different Manners, which we may make ute
of as Occafion offers, as much or as little as we think proper; tho' ne-
ver too much; fince Variety tires no one, but is always pleating: As
here a Viflo, there Bolcage, Houfes, Coc. here, a winding Road,
there, again a Building hiding, Part of the Offskip; here, a level
Ground; there, a River befet with Trees, partly running towards the
Point of Sight, and then bending, either to the right or left cross the
Piece round a Rock; and at lalt to difappear. Variety feeds a cor
tinual delightful Defire; but we mult know, that it principally respects
Ordonnances in the open Air or Landskips.

CHAP. VII. Of Agreeableness in irregular and contrafting Objects
F we have not Knowledge in Compolition, all that we endeavour
at is Extravigancy; even should we bring out a good Difpofition,
it would be owing to Luck; when a well-ordered Piece, tho' indif-
ferenely coloured, will always have an Harmony. The Truth of this
I find clearly evinced in irregular Objects; which give Life and Moti-
on to an Ordonnance; as we have leveral times thewed in treating of
Ordennance, and alfo in the firft and laft Examples of the foregoing
Chapter.
This Motion is happily ferch’d out, if the contrafting Objects be
confiderately joined; for by this means they will meet each other to

agreeably as perfectly to pleafe the Eye; not as placed thus by Na-
ture, but as the Refull of an artful Compofition.
By the Irregularity of Objects, 1 underfland their Forms; as when one
is high, another is oblong; this pointed, that (quire, round, oval,
C8c. Bur ere I proceed further, shall thew the ealy Mechod I took in
order to get the Knowledge of Irregularity.
Firft, I drew all forts of Figures in different Actions, as fitting,
Standing, fooping, lying, walking, Coc. and cut them out with Scif.
fors Next, I made a Skerch of my Ordonnance, and laid it down
fat, and put my cut Figures upon it, moving them about cill I was
farisfied where to place a fitting, flanding or lying one; how many
faired here; how few, there; and thus, after much thifting, I brought
forth a good Ordonnance; which I then deligned fair, making fuch Al-
teration in the Actions of the Figures as I thought proper, yer retain
ing their Poftures in general; leaving large and flanding ones where
they ought to be, and the small ones lying or fitting in their Places:
And to forth.
By this means I have found, that a Landskip, with many and small
Frgures, ought to confift of lurge By-works for fetting them off, viz.
large and crofe Trees, heary Stone-work, broad Grounds, Coc. And
withindoors, in a Palace or Apartment, there ought to be, behind
small Figares, large and flat Walls, with few Ornaments; for were they
to confilt of many Parts, all would feem alike large; and were we to
place by large Figures lome large Parts, all would appear small; or,
to speak better, equally turge. A large Object mult make another
small; an oblique one, anothererell; and a square one, others pointed or
round; for Contraries muft be brought together, that the one may
thew the other.
It is the same with Light. If a large Part confiff either of Light or
Shade, let one be the Ground for the other; for inftance, if, on the fe-
cond Ground, a large Part be in Shade, let the third have some Charp
and glittering Lights; this will help the broad Shades and wanton
Lights: But thole two Choices require a different Management; the
Principsl ought always to precede, and the other to be fubfervient to
it: In Landskip the immrecable Objects predominate, and the moveable
ones ferre only for Ornament; contrarily, in an Ordonnance the Figures
are fird disposed, and then the By-werks; for when we fay, that an up-
right flanding Figure mult be placed by a bending Tree, and a crook
ed Stem, by a ftanding Figure, we underlland by the former the Stem
to be the Prinips!, and the Figure the Affiliant, if in a Landship; but

in an Hiffory, the Figure is principal: Thus it is allo in an Apartment
with Architecture, Statues, Bass-reliefs and other Ornaments.

The Irregalarity of Objects does therefore give a particular Deco-
rum and Elegance; for what Satisfaction would it be to the Eye to fee
some beautiful Grapes and Melons lye each in a feparate Dith? But if
Grapes, Melons or other Gibbous, round, oval and large Fruits were
grouned together, they would add a Luftre to each other.
We Know, that a lmall Houte vifibly magnifies a Temple or Pa-
lace; and that a long and low Building makes a Tower or Maufoleum
look high.
Such Contraricties as thefe are many;
and, to name them all, would
be as tedious as impoffible; wherefore I shall content myfelf with men-
tioning some of the chief.

CHAP. VIIl. Of Gring Objects againt faint Grounds; and the
centrary, or, Dartress againt Light, and Light against Darkness.
A V IN G already spoken largely about the Management of
the Colours, which is one of the capital; Parts of Painting, I
have taken great Pains in building some Rules thereupon, with
a View, that when Occation required, I might give good Reafons for
to doing. Under my prefent Misfortune this Comfort is left, that I
now have nothing to hunder what 1 firmiy purpote, and therefore can
confider it with more Vigour than ever; I even imagine it in a de-
gree equal to Nature herfelf, fince I lnow perfeclly the Strength and
Nature of Colours and their EficTs.
Confider then the following Example, Plste KXVIIl. whether it
be of Moment.
The Man A m a warm Fillemor Drapery, is againtt the faint Off-
ship: The Woman B in a light blue Draperr agaumithe Trees behind
her: Or, A beautiful Sky-colour Blue, and B pale Red: Again, A
dark beautiful Red, and B Rofe-colour Or, A Purple, and B Whire;
thefe are the principal and moll luitable Alcerations, befides changeable
Stufts
Some perhaps may ask, whether the blue Drapery, which we place
here againt the Oftship, does not contradict what we have formerly faid;
namely, that Blue is rechoned among the weak Colours? Andyet here
we affert Warmth againt Faininels, and the contrary: To which 1 an
Iwer negatively; becaute wecall warm Colours, thofe which are purc
and unmixed, erz. beautiful Skv-blue, beautful Fellow and beautiful
Red; whereas, when thote Colours are mixed with Whire, their
Warmthnolonger lubills; becaute their Durkness gives the Glow. We
fee, on the contrary, that light Blus, lighe Fellow and light Red, even
Whireirself, ferre for weak Colours againtt the dark, as this Example
Shews
The Reafon why A ought now to be of a fingle or capital Colour,
is, becaute the Ctiship, being made up of to many tender and faint
Colours

Coloturs, shall have no Communication with it; which makes the one
the better retire, and the other approach. B does the fame contrarily.
This small Example is of fuch a Nature, that any Ordonnance of
what Kind foever, as well within Doors as in the open Air, aterfrom
 must thereby become good
a
if we incroduce, inflead of the Offskip, a Building with Bats-reliets.
Figures or other Ornaments, of a weak Colour, or elfe of Marble, it
will antwer the fame Purpofe; and if, inflead of the Trees, we exhibit
a Curtain, Grotto, Rock or other Building of warm Stope, it will be
the fame again, with respect to Colour: But if A come againt a fist
Ground, of one Colour, whether Grey or White, then that Figure
map be of different Colours, or changeable Stuff. Likewife if we place
Bagainll an Hlanging, or a party-coloured Ground, that Figure muft
needs be of a fingle Colour or Drapery; wherefore we are enabled to
judge how far this Obtervation extends.
Yet as this Example shews only Light and Darkness, we shall fub-
Join another in Plate XXVill. aforetaid, with a third or middle Tint;
which, with the former, will fuffice for giving a right Notion of
compoting all Sorts of Ordonnances, as well within Doors as in the open
Air, as before faid; alcho’ the Delign were to confifl of 2, 3. 4 or
more Groups; observing the Grounds againft which they come, whether
faint, flrong, diffant or near; to the end those Croups may, by the
Force of light or weak Colours, obtain their due Beauty; I speak not
in reference to any one in particular, but all in general.
We find, that when dark Colours are placed againtt a faint Offskip,
they are vilibly fet off, and make the one appear diftant, and the other
near; and the more, when we fet some light and weak Colours on the
fore Ground, whereby shey fill have a greater Effect; as we may ob-
ferre in Figure A.
From which Premifes tis plain, that the fame can be effected
by the contrary Method; to that the Argument of some, namely,
that Rrong and warm Colours ought always to be placed forwards, in
order to approach the more, and the weak ones to be in proportion to
their Diftance, the fainter the further, is intirely overthrown for want
of contidering, that the Strels lies meftly in the back Ground.
The Example now before us is like the former, the fore Ground ex-
cepted, which is added to it, the better to explain our MMeaning in the.
ordering the Colours to advantage; by which Method we can difpole.
our Ordonnances with cafe, and to as to ferch out a beautiful Harmo

CHAP. IX. Of the Painting Objects dustily.
THERE is Rill one Thing which many Painters careletly pats
over, tho' very ufeful and elegant, if well and naturally obferved:
It relates to suck Objects as are duly, as well in Roomsas in a Gar-
den; for tho' the former be fomerimes fwept, and the latter cleaned,
yet Pedettals, Balluftrades, Parapets, Vafes and Statues always elcape;
Galleries and publick Places for walking in, are likewife feldom clean
ed: It is therefore, in my Opinion, very improper in thofe, who with
great Care reprefent the Prvements of the faid Places with Stones of di-
vers Colours very difinctly jointed, one dark, another light, without the
leaft Spot of Unckanness which makes it very difficultto get a good De-
corum, or caule thole Pavements to look fat, without Offence to the
Lyc; cauting moreover an exceffive Stiffuets, be the Colours ever to
well ordered; whereas ufually in a large Apartment, daily walked in,
we cannot, in the aforefaid dittind Manner, perceive what the Colours
of the Floorare, except towards the Extremicies and next to the Walls;
wherefore the Middle, where is the moft walking, must appear dull,
Wiit.

uniting, and almoff of one Tint. Some Painters exprets the Compart
ments of fuch Floors so diffinttly, that you would even imagine they
were wer. I grant indeed, that lometimes in the Life it is fo, by means
of the dark Stone; yet if we break and make them a lictle lighter,
they will then not pare so much, and yet be no lets natural: s if an
Apartment were furrounded with a marble Surbafe, and in the middle
of the Room were a gilt Ciftern, by which the Floor may very well
appear prong, becaule of its Agreement with the Marble, and the
glitier of the Ciftern.
For my part, I should rather chule a plain Floor than a comparted
one; but if we lie under a Neceffity to introduce the latter, the beft
Mechod will be, to unite the Colouring in fuch a Manner that the
Tints differ but little from each other.
This Obfervation does in an especial Manner affect Landship; fince
tis certain, that the Parts which abound with Trees, whether Woods
or Sides of Roads, are fubject to Rain and Wind; and, by means of
Dufl or Sand, the Greens, Tombs, Pyramids, Vafes, and all other
Objects in fuch Places, are to fullied and covered, that the true Colours
of the faid Objects are hardly perceptible: For inftance, in fuch 2
Place as we now speak of, flands a red Tombon a black Plinth; now,
if we make this Tomb or Plinth too dark, or too frong, it will look
as if it had been waked; whereas contrarily it ought, by means of
the Dult of the Branches and Leaves which fomerimes fall on it, to be
to covered over, that we shall fcarce perceive, whether the Tomb be
red, or the Plinth black.
Alcho' some may think this Obfervation too triffing and far-ferch’d,
is nevertheless highly neceffary, in order to find, befides by other Me-
thods, the Litelibood in a Picture; whether it be, for breaking thereby,
in fome meafture, and uniting Objects, which, through the Nature of
their Colour, would have too great a Force, or for any other Caule;
fet not without Reafon, that it may not appear too affected.
But here, methinks, I hear some object, that if we thus oblerve in
every thing this Dull and Sully, long Gowns and train'd Cloaths can-
not be free from it; especially thofe of Women, which are common-
ly of beautiful and light Colours, and muft confequencly be at the
Bottoms, as well as their white Sandals, more or less dulty, to the no
fmall Laughter and Wonder of the People: To which 1 antver, that
Ishould more wonder, to fee a Perfon come dry out of the Water,
than cleap out of Dufl and Dirt; for tho' we do not fee it obferved by
others, who have always made the Sandals beauriful and white, even
those

thofe of a common Soldier, as well as of a General; and a train'd Gown
the fame; yet 1 fay, that this Obfervation does not tend to countenance
AEtakes, pot to make us mindful of the Natures of Things, and to
exprets then in our Piltures with all Likelibood, more or lels as the Mat
cer requires, not fuperffuoulty, but in Moderacion; a Virtue which, tak=
ing place in other things, should not be negletted in this Point. A ju-
dicious Mafter will obferve an Equilibriam, in order to prevent Aver-
tion, fince Things too beautiful are unnatural, and thofe which are too
dirty ditagrecable to every one. This Management would alfo not
be juftifiabie, could we not, as I have faid, perceive the Reafon of it;
as in poor People, Countrymen, and fuch like, with old and tattered
Cloaths, which wear not without foiling and gathering Dult.
But this Obfervation is of no ufe to thofe, who, not apprehending
the Caufes of Things, will have every thing as beautiful as posfible;
whereas Likelibood should appear in all Parts Prudenter agende.

E JVDGE this Point to be one of the moft important in
the Art of Painting; for without a thorough Know-
h ledge of it tis impostible to make a good Picture;
wherefore I shall thew all, that by Discourfe I can bring
2
forth, as the Refule of what I have learned by many
f Observations and long Experience.

Of a common Light.
Objects, in a common Light, have no broad fharp Lights, and their
Shadesare uncertain: The lecond Tint and Shade keep their own Co
lours much better in a clear Hir without Clouds; becaute the Objects,
being lighted on all Sides without Vapour, appear fentible, and more
relieved than in Sun fhine. This Light I think beft for Pourtraits, and fuch
Objects as we would have enlightened from without the Picture; as an
open Gallery or fuch like Place; and tho' the Objects thus lighted have

no great Force, we neverthelets find, that the mais Teuches both in
Light and Shade are firenger than in otber Lights.
This Light gets great Elegance and Advantage by low Horizens;
when if makes greater Shades; as under the Leating of Trees, Mould
ings and Projectures of Buildings, and fuch like.
Of the Light in a cloudy Sty.
We need not wonder, why the Objects in a cloudy Air appear
more fentible than in Sun-thne or clear Weather; becaute the Air or
Capours, being moftly exhaled, leave the Objects below without Mis.
riness, and thus afford a much Charper Tranparency for viewing every
thing, without the leat Obstruction; for which Reafon, Things in a
cloudy Air, teem lels to go off from us, and appear dark and near,
and of a more beautiful Colour; especially the Green of Grats and
Trees
Of a Sun shing Light.
Objects enlightened by the Sun are more or lets mifty, as the Sun
thines frong or weak; for this Reafon, that the Atoms or Motes be-
tween us and the Point of Sight feem more deafe, by the Strength of
the Sun, than in a common or clear Light; and are more or lels ting-
ed; by which means the Shales of Objects become faint at ence, and
go of more suddinly, than in another Light; wherefore we may ealily
conceive, that, tho' the Shades are broader, and more fenfibly limited,
than in another Light, yer they appear not to Charp as fome Mafters
have, by Mistake, expretted them; efoecially Berchem, in his Objects
lets than the Life; this indeed would be well enough in covered Pla-
ces, as Galleries, Palaces, Apartments, where there is no Hir; where
by the Objects then appear more perfelt, plain, and less retiring;
Suppofe, for Intlance, you walk thro' tome fhady Trees, it is cer
tain, that, comins towards the End of them, you will fee the Objects
in the open Air plainer and better than in the Field; the Prospective
glats evidencly proves this, were the Day ever fo clear. Obferve then
in general, that (as I have faid) the Objects grow faint more fuddenly
and difappear in Sun fhine; which herein principally differs from com
mon Light
Of

191
Chap. I.
Of the Light in Halls, Rooms and other Apurtments.
For Pieces to be hung againtt Walls of Apartments, the common
Light is moft proper, if the Difpofition of the Light of the Place
will permit, as being the moft moderate and agreeable when well and
naturally expreffed. This Conduct then is principally to be obferved
in it, that the Figures and other Objects be lighted more or less
ftrong and bread, according to their Nearness to, or Distance from the
Light of the Windows; and, tho' flanding on the same Ground, they
ought neverchelets to be different in Force of Light and Dullness of
Shades. So alfo the Ground-pades on Walls, Grounds and other Ob-
jects, should be, some sporter, fironger and more sensible than others.
The Figures clofe to the Windows mult therefore certainly receive their
Light from on high, and have sorter Groundshades, than thote which
are further from them.
But as it may havpen, that the Objects, diffant from the aforelaid
Light, may receive Light from other Windows, to their Sbades ought
alfo to break more or lets, and to become faint, becaule they are encom-
patted by alarger Light, besides Reffexions from the Walls. The Shades
of fuch Objects are alfo warmer than in the open fir, where the Blueof
the Sky and Vapours very much weaken them, and make them faint.
We mult likewife oblerve in general, that in an Apartment hung
with Red, Vellow, Blue of Green, all the Shades of the Objects are
thereby reffected, and partike of the same Colour; but the Touches and
Shades of the fainteft Objects will appear the firenger.
A Compendium of the Lights.
in cloudy Weather, the Objects are lets retiring, more warm, and more
fentible.
in clear Weather without Clouds, a little more retiring.
in sun shing Weather, sill more retiring, and less fentible.
in fogey Weather (as at the latter End of the Vear, or in Winter)
the moft retiring, and more fuddenly difappearing.
The groffer the Air, the more Body it has; and the more Body, the
more vilibly lighted; whereby the Sight is thortened, and the Objects
appear more indiffinct. Thus much as to Objects in the open Air.

Thefe four particular Lights, naturally handled, are certain
Proofs of a skilful Mafter; and it would, in my Opinion, look very
agreeable, to fee fuch Pieces king by one another, embellifhed as follows.
In lgudy Weatfer, the iferdimen, fearful of Rain and Storms, are
packing up their Bassage; the Sheep every where making towards
32
them, Litless and hanging their Heads; which they are driving in an
Hurry into the Woods, looking continually at the Sky; in fine, the
Bullle is great, and every one in Motion.
in clear Wesiber, the Herdlmen walk hand in hand; others fit here,
and there, by a Founain, in Difcourfe; a third Croup divere themfelves
with tinging and skipping about, and tome play on the Hautboy, Fife,
Reed of Straw-pipe, Intiruments ufual among Country-people; and in
the mean time their Flocks are grazing in Safety.
in Junfking Weather, the Shepherds and Shepherdeffes fit at eafe
under their (pread Cloaths; some by a llater-fall wathing themfelves;
others fleeping in the Shade of a Fountain, or Trees; their Flocks are
grazing up and down in Croups; some chewing the Cud for Coolness,
others drinking at a River, others lying in the Shade.
In sagey Wiather, the Herdlmen are driving their Flocks nomewards;
walking with Concern, and Chruroing their Shoulders, and poking out
3
their Heads, carefully looking to fee whether a Sheep or Goat have not
been loff in the Fos, and clotely guarding the Flock on every side. The
young Women follow, with Cloths or Veils on their Heads; and some
are slopping their Noles with them, becaute of the Srench of the Fog

HE Sky is a wide Expantion, feeming lower or higher as tis
more or less replete with Vapours; now the Sky is certainly
never without Vapours, fince, were there none, it would be e
very where blue, as well on the Horizon as over our Heads: But we
fee, it appears lighter next the Horizon than vertically, becaute the
Vapours fog and diminiththe beautiful Bluetbere. Tis allo plain, that
the nearer the Air is to the Earth, the more denfe and gross it is; and
in Proportion to ir's Afcent, the more rarified and tranfparent. The
Vapoursare likewife more or lets fentible in Proportion to their Dentity
of Rarity.

We muff obferve here, that when the Sun rifes in the Eoft, it is
then, in that Part, lighter on the Horizon, than in the three others;
and at Noon tis lighter in the South; and to round; becaute this large
heavenly Body communicates its Infiuence to every thing near and a-
bout it.
I shall now demonterate, by an Example, the Reafon why the Va-
pours, the further they are from us, become the lighter: Take a thin
Gaule, 8 or to Vards long, and ftrain it, in the open Air, on four
Poles; mark each Vard with a Crots-line, numbered 1, 2, 3, to 10;
then place yourfelf under No. 1. and, looking along to the End of
you will perceive the Blue of the Sky less in the second
the Straining
Divifion; and the further, fill lefer; becaute the thin Threads dou-
bling before your Eyes, thereby thicken the Gaule more and more,
and abace its Thinness or Tranfparency; infomuch that at latt you per-
ceive nothing but an intire white Stuf.
Suppofe now, that the Stars were up, and you were to make the
same Experiment; you would find them to appear most diffintt in the
firft Division, and ditappear in Proportion as they go off; which is a
plain Proof, that tho' the Air be ever to Rare, forwards or near, yet,
it becomes groffer, the further of, and confequently more Body must re-
ceive more Ligbt.
Tis for this Reaion, that the Stars are never feen very near the Ho-
rizon; and if we do perceive any thereabout, they are but small and
weak.
Between the Air and Water there is no Difference; the one feems to
be an Impreffion of the other; to wit, both of them light towards
the Horizon, and the Air over head and Water forwards both dark.
As for the Ground or Plan, which receives its Light from the Hex-
vens, I do not find it necelfary to arlign other Reafons for proving,
that the Cafe of this is quite contrary to that of the Air; fince Per-
peltive thews, that every thing enlightened, if it have but a folid
Body, darkens more and more the further it goes off from us: Sup-
pofe, for Inftance, an open Gallery, 600 Feet long, having an even
Floor; you will perceive the firft Foot to be the lighteff, and to on to
the further End, less and less light. The same may be obferved in Fi-
gures cleathed in Wbite, and how much the firft will differ from the
lall. I (peak only of what is in the Light; for the Cafe is quire dif-
ferent with what is dark, and in Shade; as we may fee when Figures
are dreft in Black, that then they become lighter and lighter by the
thickening of the Vapours.

The Objects which appear in a level Field, when the Air is with-
out Clouds, and the Sun, hidden either behind a Mountain or Tree,
will receive Light from all Sides, and jet keep their Relief by reason of
their firong and dark Tourbes. Their Colours are not broken, but re-
tain their nacural Beauty: And tho' the Sun, as before faid, be hid
den by fomething, and cannot then shine on the Objects, they will
neverthelets receive more or lets Light from the fir on the Side where
the Sun is hidden, without altering the Colours.
That the Blue of the Sky is no Colour, we can plainly perceive by
the Objects in an open Field, when the Sun or light Clouds fhine not
on them, which are not in the leaft tinctured by it; as being nothing
elfe than a vafl Remotencts or Height, from whence it comes forth,
and therefore not able to impart this Colour to the Objects, as they do
their's to one another, for want of Body.
Since we are treating of the Virtues of the Hir, it will not be a
mils to fay fomething of its Reffexion; a Matter worthy of Obfervari-
on; fince in that Point are offen comminted great Miltakes: And to
explain it, we thall exhibir the three following Examples.
A. B. The Numbers fignify the Tints; as 1 is one Tint; 2, one
Tint darker, and y, a Tint darker than the preceding.
The Figure A, Plare KXIK. is a Tint darker in Shade than Bfor
this Realon; that the Trunk of the Tree C has a rough Superficies
which can gire no Light; and the white Houfe D contrarily can give
a great Light or Reffexion; Now if the Houfe were not there, but a
lerel Field inflead of ir, B would rather be lighter than darker;
and if the Trunk and Buthes behind it, were alfo taken away, thofe
two Figures would have a like Shade: Whereas now we fee two Fr
gures on one Line or Ground, one darker and the other lighter, tho'
the darkeff Shades in the latter keep their own Force; which, did
they appear otherwife, would be againt Nature and the Rules of
Art.
The second Exemple has the fame Obfervation.
Now I am well altured from Experience, that if we were to give
to tome (who had never feen this Sketch, or known the Reafon of it)
an Oatline of the following or fuch a Defign, difpoted alike, and one
Figure as far from the Trees as the other is near it, flanding in a Line
parallel with the Horizon, in order to shade them according to their
Own Notions, they would reprefent them both alike in Light and Shade;
tho' by an infallible Rule, he who flands furtheff from the Trees,
have more Light round about him than be who is nearer; and therefore it
cannot poffibly be otherwife than as we fee here exhibited; to wit, Bone
Ti

Tint in Shade, and 2 in the Ground shade; and A 2 Tints in Shade,
and 3 in the Groundshade. Now behold the Woman on the fore=
ground, who, like B, has one Tint in Shade, by reafon of the Re-
flexion of the Stone flanding near her. The Groundshade upon that
Stone confifts of three Tints; and if the Stone, or any firch Hindrance
were not there, the ir would caute the fame Effect, tho' not fo
Rrongly.
Some may poffibly think, that the Houle is too far to caule fuch a
Reffexion; and that then the Figure A ought not to differ to much;
but I fay, that the Trunk C with the May-bubes behind, to interpole,
that the Figure A cannot receive any Reflexion from the Houfe, and
therefore it mult naturally be one Tint darker in Shade than B. Would
you make a far-feich’d Opposition, and dress A in White; I fay then,
that there would be no need either of the Trees or Houfe; when yet
irs plain, that the one as well as the other is thus ordered to ferve for
an Example.
The third Example, Plate XXK. confirms the two former; in
which we plainly fee the Reafons why Objects are weakened more or
less in their Shades, not only by the Reffexions of other Objects, but
allo by the fir on the left Side; and the Groundshades the fame,
which are darkened more or less beyond the Reach of the faid Air or
Reffexion: As it appears on the three Columns, in which tis evident,
that the Ground-thades of 1 and 3 are a Tint fainter than that of 2; the
Pillar 1 by the Light of 2 and the Air, and 3 by the Airalone. The
Pillar 2 is about half-way from the bottom darker in its Reffexion
than above, and its Groundthade one Tint darker than 1 and 3, by
reafon of its flanding nearer to 3, and whereby Pillar 2 comes to caft
its Ground shade on 3, which Ground-hade covers the Light of 3
half-way; whereby this laft cannot reflect thus far againtt 2, nor in its
Ground thade. Thefe Effects happen as well in Sun-fhine as common
Light, without the leaft Alteration.
We exhibit here another Example in Plate XXX. aforefaid, which
affords no lels Confideration than the foregoing; and whereby I thew
the Force of Light and the Mainlight Touches upon Objects, and how
unlike they appear in two Objects alike, according as the Horizon is
high or low. A and Bare the Inttances, and Cand D, the Proofs of
it, that it cannot be otherwife. The Cafe is the fame, whether the
Light be Sun-fhine of common; or whether it be fronting or fideways.

Sight in the middle, or fomewhat more to the right Side. The Light
proceeds allo from the right.
Now confider, how the two Heads A and B, tho' having one and the
fame Light, differ in their Main ligh-Touches; A having thofe Touch-
es on the Forehead, and all the projecting Parts, as Nofe and Chin,
under Lip, and to forth; and B having them on the Rife of the Brows,
Corners of the Eyes, befide the Nofe and along the Check, Tip of
the Nofe and Chin, Cc. which Atteration is only cauled by the Point
of Sight, according to its Pofition either high or low. When the Ob-
jelts (be they of what Kind foever, if but smooth and even, as Marble,
Copper or the Life ittelf) fland under an high Horizon, the aforefaid
Main-ligbt-Touches go upwards, and on the contrary defcend, the more
the Objelts are elevated above the Horizon; as we have faid, and is here
demonftrated; Now obferve CD of the fame Stuff as the foremoff
Heads, and lighted by the fame Light, where C has a flrong Height
ening on the rifing Part; which defcends more or less as it rifes above
the Horizon.
This Example is of great Mloment, and procduces uncommon Things;
in which we should fometimes be at a Loss, and which would not occur
to us in many Vears: I (peak in reference to thofe who are too conti-
dent of quick Conceptions, and do not duely weigh Things; for it mull
be allowed, that, without the Knowledge of Perspective, it is impofli-
ble to trace Truth from the Secrets of Nature, in order to bring it to
pats in our Works. Tis true, we can imitate the Life, a Gold or Sil-
ver Por, Kerle, Dith or other Chining Piece of Houhold fluft, as fine
as the Life; but may be vaftly miftaken in the Ules of them in our
Ordonnances, if we do not regard the Motions of the Glitterings;
which are as various as incredible; and yet all thofe Things may
be eafily apprehended, if we underfland, and fometimes prattile, Per

CHAP. III. Of Reffesions in the Water.
HE reprefenting Reflexions in the Water is certainly not of the
leaft Moment, and their Agreeableness makes them worthy to
be naturally exprefted; but as there are not affigned, or will be
found, any certain Rules for them, without the id of Perspettive, to
is lofl Labour to feek any: For which Reafon, some Landskip-paint

ers often pats over the Reffexions in the Water, to avoid the Trouble
of Perspective.
Neverthelels the incomparable Pousin has not forgot to make ule of
them, and he has got great Reputation thereby; 1 lpeak of Nicholys,
who was as famous for Landskip as Figures, and who never met with
any Difficulties which he did not furmount.
Having earneftly applied to this Point, I confidered, whether there
could not be found other thorter Means to effect it, than by planning
Lines, Coc. that to agreeable a Part of Art might not be neglected;
and after long Trial I difcovered the following Method.
Take an oblong Board of what Size you preafe, and place thereon
some Wax-Figures as clofe to the Edge as you think proper, or accord-
ing to their Diftance from the Water, which they ought to have in
your Pilture. Bend thefe Figures into fuch Actions as your Sketch re-
quires, and place them, by means of little bits of Wood or Potters
earth, as high or low as you defire; then take a Trough (made for
that Purpofe) of Lead, Wood or Tin, painted within fide with fuch 2
Ground as you want, whether Black, Umber or Terrevert, and fill
it with Water, and fet it againtt the Board and Figures, as high or
low as your skerch’d Ground direlts. Next, fix your Point of Sight;
and, after having found your Diftance, place yourfelf there, either
Randing or litting, and thus defign the Figures with their Reffexions;
Hlighily allo marking the Shades: Then fet your Layman to each
Figure, and delign it very carefully; fixing the Layman each Time in
the Place where each Figure ffood, to as to fee its Reffexion like that
in your Sketch.
Here especially take notice of the Length and Breadth of the Re-
Rexion; for it always shortens more than its Object; becaute it is to
much lower under the Horizon. When you place the Model or Lay-
man as much above the Horizon as it reflects under it, and delign it
thus correctly, in order to paint after it, you hold the Drawing uplide
down: Here you will poffibly fay, that the Reffexion ought to be re-
vers’d; which I do not difown; but then you can make an Impreffion
of your Sketch on another Paper, and thereby perceive the good
Effelt.
Having proceeded thus far, and painted after your Skeich, you may
be affured every thing is right.
But here let it be obferved, that the Reffexions mull always be
perpendicular with the Objects above them, as if growing out of each
other; as we may fee in Plats EXXl.
This

Book V.
This Merhod relates not only to the placins of Figures, but all o-
ther Objects of what Kind foever; as Horfes, Dogs, Pyramids, Stones
with Batsreliefs, Vafes, Pors and other Things, and whether they
be forwards, backwards, or at the Sides of your Painting.
You may, inflead of a Watertrough, ufe a Looking-glats; but
Tis not to narural as the Water, which may be made to look deep or
shallow, and as dark or light as you pleafe, by placing a little Mud,
Grats or Sand in the bottom of the Trough.
As for the Colouring, Experience teaches, that the more the Water
is enlightened by the Sky, the more ancertain the Reffexions are; and
when the Sun fhines directly on the Warer, the Objects will appear
ib are uncertain, as well with respect to us, as thofe who view
themfelves therein; for the Reffexions then appear only as defcending
Rays, without any Shape; as we fometimes fee by a Candle, the
Moon or other Thing, which gives only a Reflexion on the Surface of
the Water, whether in Sun-thine or by Night; becaute we cannot then
perceive the Trantparency of the Water.
The Reffexions in the Warer, tho' it be quite dark and clear, are
never so light as their Objects witheut; but always a Tint or an half
durker.
Now, to reprefent the Reffexions in a running Water, you muft firtt
paint it with Light and Shade, on a Ground rubbed thinly over with a
firtle rough Oil; then take a large foft Pencil, and here and therecross
harch it. But a better Way, is, to take a long hair’d Fitch, and make
the Strokes as clole as the Veins of the Waterrun, taking Care, not to
Itrike out too much of the Our line. But as Glass is a diaphanous Body,
and therefore has so Confancy or Fixednels, nor can effect any Thing,
but by Means of fomething elle having more Body, as by the Earch,
which is a firm Body; (this we fee, when the Glass isfilvered or pirch-
ed) to with Water the Cafe is the fame; which will produce no Effect,
nor receive the Form of any Object, unless there be a firm Ground to
fx its Transparency; as we mavice by a Piece of ice.
Having laid enough of the Reffexions which concern Objects out of
the Water, it will be neceffary to oblerve fomewhat about Objects pand
ing in the Water; a Point well worth our Notice, on Account of the
uncommon Occurrences which happen in it, tho' as little heeded as if
they were on the Land, and no Water thereabouts.
We mult fuppose the Water to be like the Air, and that the Objects,
between it and the Air, feen from Topto Bottom, appear the fame as
if they were uplide down againtt the Hir; there being no other Dif
ference

Chap. 3.

ference between the Lights of either, than that Water is a little fainter
than the Air; as may be apprehended by a Looking-glats, in which,
the Objects, tho' they appear ever to plain, do not come up to the
Life irtelf.
Thefe Things being premifed, tis eafy to conceive, that Objects
Randing in the Water are enlightened as well from below as above. I
(peak not here of the Reffexions of Objects, but of the Objects them-
felves, and their Shades, as may be seen in Plate KXXl aforefaid The
Man A who extends his right Arm over the Water, receives flrong Re-
fexions from below, of a violet Colour, like that of the Air, above
him, along his chaded side; and his left Arm, across his Breaft, re-
ceives a double Reffexion; to wit, from the Water, and from his Body;
whereby tis of a more warm Colour than the other. The young Man
Bfooping over a Stone, views himself in the Water, in the Shade of
the Tree: By him 1 thew, that the Reffexion of the Water is like that
of the Air, but a little fainter, as I faid before. The Face, on the
Stone C exhibits the fame, but more fenfibly, being allo lighted from
below.
Here we muft further obferve, that the further or higher Objects are
from the Water, the more Reffexion they receive; as may be feen in the
ManD, who, with his Breaft, is close to the Warer without any Reffex-
ion; becaute the Light over him cannot thine on it, fince he is flooping
forward, and thades the Warer to the Ground with his Body. Thus
far I have experimented; and from whence, other Circumfances may
be deduced by Practice.
in the mean time we may obferve, how much thofe Objects differ
from thofe on the Land; of which latter we muft note, that the more
theyrife from the Ground, the less Reffexion the Shades receive; be
caule the Light of the Grounds being on the Superficies, they main-
can their own conftant Colours.
Touching the Reflexion in the Warer, befides the Contraction and
Reffexion, I have been long doubting about the Irregutarity between
them and the Objects themielves; fince I perceived by the Rules of Op-
ticks or prattical Perspettive, that there was fomething more to be taken
notice of. I apprehended alfo, that as there is Air and Sun above and
below, to thote two Lights mult needs caufe an uncommon Effect in the
Objects and their Glitter or main Heightenings. But yer I could not firm-
ly conclude how or in what Manner; and the rather; becaute (which I
am much furprifed at) I never heard, that any Perfon had certainly de-
montlrared it. Atlaft, finding the greateff Difficulcy in explaining my
Concep-


Book V.
Of Lights and Sbades.
200
Conceptions, I did, to give a Sketch of it, caute an Inquiry to be made
into the Truchirfelf; as Plate XXKl. aforefaid fhews: Wherein we
plainly fee, how far Things may fometimes go beyond our Gueffes;
Thofe who try nice Experiments, mult be rejoiced, when they make
greater Difcoveries than others. We fay — He who seeks finds.
But nothing is to be obtained without Labour and Practice. Obferve
then, that the Stress lies here in the Main-light-Teuches, as the afore-
faid Figures plainly thew; but they may be qualified according to Occa-
Lion and as you think fit both in the Objects and their Reffexions.
We take then, for Example, the Objects flanding on the Water;
being under the Horizon equal to their Height, and receiving their
Light from the right; they fland on each Side of the Point of Sight,
and have their proper Lights and Shades, according to Perspective,
as allo the Mainlight Touches or Gless on the Relief. The same Ex-
periment may be made with all Sores of Objects; in all which, we
may perceive, how much the Reflections in the Water as well as the
Contractions will differ from the Objects themfelves.
This is an uncommon Obfervation; but Study will make it fami-
Lar.
CHAP. IV. Of Ground shades according to the Difference of
Lights.
T will not be improper to make some Obfervations about the
Ground fhades of Objects, and the Course of those Shades, accord
ing to the different Lights, proceeding from the Side round to the
fore Part.
As Perspective decermines exactly the Length, Breadth and Depth
of Things, to Tis impottible to reprefent any thing duely and well
without it, tho', as I may fay, we were to practife the Art an hur-
dred Vears, and the Ordonnances to confift of but two or three Fi
gures; I will not fay, of ten or more: Tis no Wonder, that we to
early caufe young Arrifts to learn Perspective, before they take to Com
polition; tis even commendable if they underfland it but indifferently,
and thun thofe who not only reject its Rules; but laugh at thofe who
fiudy them; a Converfation very prejudicial to young and unexperi-
enced Tyres. But to return to our Subject.

with respelt to the Greand-pades; becaute thole Shades, whether for
wards or diftant, always run parallel with the Horizon, without any
Forefhortening; which we may eafily find without Perfpective; as
may be feen in Plate XEKIl. Fig. r. becaute they may be conveni-
ently meafured with a pair of Compaffes, or clfe gueff at
We may then well perceive, how much eafier this is, than where
the Light is more fronting, and the Ground-hades confequently run
Tomewhat oblique and thorten, and therefore not menfurable by the
Compaffes; much less to be gueffed at, thro' their great Variety and
Diffimularity. If the Objects change their Places, the Ground pades alfo
after; one runs almoft parallel; another, more oblique and thorter;
and others Kill more, in Proportion as they go off from the Side whence
the Light comes; as in Fig. z. whereby is thewed a Method for find-
ing fuch Ground-thades, w thout Trouble or Loss of Time, in what
Manner foever the Light fall.
As to the Frentlight, as in Fig. 2. I mult further premife, that as
in such Cafe the Ground-fhades go off backwards, to we need nothing
but the Point of Sight, in order to find them; and their Fore-fhorten:
ings can be only found by means of the Gradation-line, which, tho'
a fmall Trouble, may be fooner made than read. My Method is
this.
Firft I skeich No. z. for my Ordonnance, fixing my Horizon and
Point of Sight at pleafure. Then I begin with the foremoll Fig. A.
and shade it, and ftrike its Ground-fhade at random, according as 1 fup-
pole the Light to be a little fronting. Next 1 fet my Line B (where-
on are marked the Gradation feet) on the right Side. Further I draw
a Parallelline C from the Foot of Fig. A to the aforefaid Line;
which thews its Distance Now, in order to exhibit the Courfe of its
Shade, I lay my Ruler to the Foot of Fig. A, tracing its Ground-
shade up to the Horizon, where I make a uttle Star D, from which
Star I fetch all my other Groundshades, both fore and off-ones, from
one Side to the other, whether Figures, Stones, Coc. Now, to find
the Lengths of all thefe Ground Chades, I draw again, from the End
of the Groundhade E a Parallel-line F to the Gradation line; then
I count the degrading
Feet, suppoting the Figure 7 Feet high, and iis
Ground-hade 6 Feer
long, going 2 Feet into the Piece, as smarked on

the Gradation line. Thus may all other Objects be managed; by. o
ly counting their Heights, in order to give the Depchs of their Ground;
thades accordingly.

Tis now eaty to judge, how difficult it would be to find the Varia-

This Method has a further Advantage, in affifting thofe who will
finith all their Figures after the Life; for, by the Courfe of the said
Groundfhades, we can prefently know where to place the Model or
Layman with respect to the Light of the Piece; as we have demon-
Rrared in our Drawing-book.
CHAP. V. Of Reffexions in general.
O make this Obfervation plain, I have thought proper to it.
luftrace it by one or two Examples; becaute tis one of thofe
principal Beauties of a Picture, whereby we every where dif
corer the Malter.
Irs not improper for wearied Huntimen, or Nymphs, to reft in
Shades; as in this Example, Plite KXKIIl. Here they fit forwards
in the left Corner of the Piece, on a green Bank, againtt a Wall quite
over-run and shaded by the Trees; on the Tops whereof, here and
there, are feen some lmall frong Lights. The flanding Figure receives
the frongelf Light almoft down to the Knees; and the remaining Part,
uniting with the Ground, fhews its Diffance: The Light of this Figure
has however not to much force as to give the Wall, behind the fitring
Figures, any Reffexion; partly becaute those Figures are between, and
partly on account of the Roughness of it; as being full of Breaks, Holes
and projecting Branches and Leaves, which double the Shade, and admit
little or nothing of the reffetting Rays of the Figure. We fee con
trarily, that the Figures fitting over againtt the light Object or Figure,
receive, without Hindrance, firong Reffexions, the one from before,
the other fomewhat fideways, according to their firting, either behind,
forwards or in the middle.
Tis of great Moment to thew plainly the true Caufe of the faid Re-
Rexions, as to Diffance, Colour and Force. Of the Colour 1 shall lay
this (for the Diftance I have already shewed) that, were the faid light
Frgure drel in beautiful light Red, and frongly lighted by the Sun,
and the four firting ones dreft in Purple, Vellow, Blue and Whice,
they would certainly be adulterated by the red Reffexion, and parly
lofe their own Colours, in order to take that of the other, and be
mixed with ir. As for Inftance, the Purple will become Red; the
Blne,

Blue, Viclet; the Fellow, Rulfet or Fillemor; and the White, Ap-
ple-bloffom of Fleth-colour: Vet some more than others, according as
they receive faint or flrong Reffexions, diftant or near: Moreover the
Naked will become more warm, not all over but in the Parts which
are tinged by it; for the Air round about is feen lets or more, whe
ther in the Shade; of between it and the Part which receives the Re
fexion.
The second Example in Plate XXXIIl. aforefaid shews the Break
ing of the Shades, according to the Place, as well in Colour as Force.
The Stone-wall is of a Ruffet and warm Colour; the flanding Fi-
gures dreft in White or light Colours are, with the Stones and Ground
about them, lightened by a common Light or Sun-thine.
Thefe Objects hew us, that tho' the Light, which comes upon
them, be pure and unmixed, their Shades are neverthelefs quite adul-
terated; becaute they are hidden from the Air, and furrounded with
a warm Ground, and receiving no other Light than from the Refiexi-
ons of the faid Ground, the Colour whereof the Shades take: We fee
the contrary in the undermoft flying Figure, to wit, that the more
the Objects approach the Air, the cleaner they become, and Keen
their own Colour; as appears in the uppermolt Figure, which is half
in the Air, and not the leall altered in its Shade; lave that it becomes
a little more purplith according to its Distance; which may be vifibly
seen in its Under-parts, and in the loweff flying Figure; which is flitl
in the dark, and cannot be rouched by the Blue of the Air, being of
a quite different Colour from the uppermoft; to wit, more warm, as
are allo the Figures which fland below.
Formerly few Mafters underfood Reffexions, especially among the
Ialians. Among the French we find some made ufe of them. How-
ever I freely own, that fuch of the Irations (were there but one) who
obferved them, underffood them in Perfection; and the French but in-
differencly; tho' Vouter oot his Repuration by them, having therein
done much more than all the French and Iuhans: Which makes me
believe that the Reffexions have not been long in Praftice; fince we yet
find many old Pieces wherein they, are not at all obferved; I cannot
but think, that at that Time they were unknown to them. Buss what
is Kill worfe, fome, as Laftman, Rotenhamer, &cc. did not knoty, when
an Object was in Shade, on which side it ought to be light or dark,
wherefore they shaded it like others which were in the Light,
more or less, as if it were glazed to much darker: For Ifflance; in
a Piece lighted from the right Side, you will fomcrimes fee a Fisure in

the Shade of a Stone or other Object; Now the Sharle of this Figure;
imtead of being sn the right side, occasioned by the Stone, they made
on the left, like all the reft: A true Sign that they knew nothing of Re.
Hexions. Rrphaet himself was not expert in. ii; for at. that Time
they knew nothing of placing Light againt Light, and Dark againt
Darkness; on which Occasons the Reffcixons come moft to pass; whereas
they fought the chief Effelts and Harmony in oppoting Light to Shade,

and the contrary, and therefore needed no Reffexions: Moreover they
avoided all great Shades and Broadness. But now-a-days the Manage
ment is quite different; we are for great Sbades: And what makes an
Ordonnance look finer than great Shades and Lights, whether Build-
ings with Figures and Batsreliefs, woody Groves or any thing elfe,
quise in Shade, agreeably lighted by the Reffexions of Greands,, Rir or
other light Objects! R certainly gives the Eyc great Satisfaction, with
respect to Pariety; and at the fame Time produces an agreeable Union
and Tendernets, as well in the whole as the Parts of a Picture. Ne
verthelets it fares with Riffexions as with all other Things, Superffuity
caufes a Surfeir. There are allo fome, who to delight in Reffexions,
that they thew them at all Adventures; and will often exprets almoll
imperceptible ones with the greateff Force, by Vermilion, Ultrama.
rine, red Orpiment, CCc. we find fuch chiefly among the Flemings as
Yordaans, Rubens, and many others.
We mall take then particular Care, not to reprefent any Reffexions
without thewing the Reatons of them, and how far or near they are to
their Caules; that we may rightly judge, what Force or Weakness
they receive or give. in a Word, that we need not be obliged to
ask, wrence the Reffexion proceeds? why it is Red, Tellow or Blue, so
Brong, so faint? &c.
CH AP. VI. That Sunskine has no more Force than common Light,
with respect to Sbades.
T:S certain, that Objects lighted by Sun-Chine have no darker or
fronger Shades than thofe in a common Light, tho' they seem to
have tronger; for the Blue of the Air is lighted more or lets, ac
cording to the Sun’s Strength or Weaknels, and therefore keeps atways
the same Tint, asI prove by the firtt Example in Plate XXKIV.
The

The Column, whether plain of ornamented with Bats relicts- like
the Trajas or Antenine, is fet up in the middle of the Field, and at X
Diffance from it, at the side of the Piece, an high Tower or Bulwark,
the Ground-hade whereof above half covers the Column; wherefore
the Sup Chines powerfully on the upper Part only, and yet we shall
aind the Shade from top to bettem of one and the same Tint.
Tis the fame with the Light of a Candlein a darkith Room; or in
the Evening; which, tho' fronger and of more force than the other
Light, yer does not in the leaft darken the Shades of the Parts on
which it comes, but lets them remain aliks, as we fee in the second Ex-
ample.
The Lantern, in the Boy's Hland, lights the Objects near it in part,
when the Refidue is lighted by the Window; we lee then, I fay, that
the Parts illuminated by the Lantern; do not become darker, in the
Shade, than if the said Light were not there. And if the Dayhappen to
be thut in, and Night approaching, it will not only be darker about
the said Light, but all over.
But its quite the reverse with transparent Objetts, luch as Stufts, A:
laballer, Horn, Cec. for want of the Solidity of the preceding Objetts;
as we fee in the third Example.
Suppofe that the Column, either of Paper or Alabafter, receive

it may be plainly diftinguithed from the other Shade whereabout is no

This Obfervation especially prevails in Nudities and transparent.
Draperies.
in Nudities lighted by the Sun, we shall find, the small or thin Parts
to be always more or less transparent; as the Eyelids, Nofe, Ears,
Fingers, Coc. and therefore they muft not have firm Shades: But Tis.

dark as the thicker: And were this Face to be painted with a beautiful
and natural Colour, it cannot be like the Life, but rather a dead Per-
fon: I fpeak with respect to Tranfparency; for we know by Experi-
ence, that the Blood, being warm, is thin and tranparent, but when.
chilly or coagulated, it is corporeal or folid; wherefore its certain,
that, in this Cafe, a dead Perfon is more like a Stone than a natural
Figure. We can plainly perceive this in flaughter’d Oxen; when the
Entrails


Of Lights and Shades:
206
Book. V.
Eotrails are taken out, and a Candle, fet within the Carcass, the Breaft
and Parts between the Ribs will be more tranfparent while the Fleth
is warm, than after is cold and has hung loager. It is the tame with
a dead Body; for if a Candle be fet behind an Ear, or next to the
Nofe, they will not be tranfparent.
The fingle Folds of thin Draperies appear more tranparent in Sun-
thine than in common Light, and have therefore sainter, Shades than
coarfer and more thick Veftments; but the Shades of double banging
Folds, especially when they are clofe together, appear in Sun-fhine
mach Bronger than in the fingle Folds of thick Stufts. Leaves of Trees
do the fame.
The Difficulty being thus folved; namely, that the Strength of
Sun thine, or a Candle, do not make the Shades darker than they are
in common Light, we fhall, to accomplish our Purpofe, thew wherein
the Sums Strength confifts; a Matter eafily to be apprehended by thofe
who have well weighed what has been before faid.
We find by Experience, that Objects lighted by the Sun have much
greater Force than thofe in common Light; which is not effected by
Rrong Shades, but by their Broadness and Sharpness; which common Light
does not gize, either within doors or in the open Air. Some imagine,
the Strength to be greater in the Sun than in common Light; which
can only make Objects approach in Proportion to their Magnitude, Di=
ftance or Nearnels, as mall Life and large Life; yet 1 fay, that common
Light has this Property as well as Sun-thine. What Difference then is
there between either! No other, than in the one broud and sarp
Sbades, and in the other, more round and melting ones. The former
-cautes plain and long Ground-shades, and the lawer, short and uncertain
ones. Hereby we properly dillinguith a Sun-thine from common Light.
That the one is more forcible than the other is no Wonder; the Proof
appearing in the two following Examples, in Plate XXKV. better
than I can express it in Words: Of thefe the firtt is lighted by the
Sun, and the second by a common Light; both alike in Darkness of
Shades; the one tharp, with long, plain Groundshades, and the other
the contrary.
I once painted an Emblem, or rather a Narciffus viewing himfelf
in the Warer: I cook the Light more fronting, as tis commonly order
ed in Sun-thine, with an incent only to thew, how I apprehended Sun
thine with respect to the melring of the Sharpness, and alfo to avoid a
Groundhade, which a Childs Head near him would have cauted on
the Cheek of Nurciffus (the Principal in the Piece, and his left Check

already in Shade) if the Light had come fideways; which would have
look’d. to very offentive, that his View could not have thewn the
Beauty wherewith he was to much enamoured; it was moreover indif-
ferent to me, whether the Light came from a Side or was more or
lets fronting, becaute it respects the general Delign no more than if it
were intirely fronting: Tis true, that large Groundhades caufe the
greatelt Elegance in Sun fhine, if they come not too clofe together
(for then they look dilagreeable, and caule a certain Melanchoty in a
Pilture) but appear more pleafant when intermixed with Gleams
of small Lights to break their too great Breadth.
I call this Piece an Emblem, becaute the Poct fays, that this Vouth,
feeing his own Likeness in the Water, fell in love with himfelf. Now
this fort of Love difcovers a vain Conceit or weak Paffion in a Man,
to far clouding his Knowledge and Judgment, that he is infentible of
what he is doing: For the more natural exprefting which Senfe, I had
placed, near Narciffus, a Child with a Fools Cap, fawning on and
embracing him, and decking his Hair, Virginlike. with Flowers;
and, to thew the Delight he rook in his Folly, his Motion and Look
bespoke one affected with the Reffexion which the Child shewed him
in the Water.
This Piece was richly filled with By-works; as Figures, Architec.
ture, Bolcage, Cattle, Flowers and Water, with delign to reprefent all
the particular Objects lighted by the Sun, each according to its Qualiry
and in the moll faitable Manner.. It was thoroughly finithed: By p-
nished, I undertland, when every thing is in it to the moft minute
Circumftance, not when only the principal Parts are expreft, and ma-
ny small Circumftances left out, or, when Things are curioutly foft-
caed; as fome, by the Word, would make us believe. Be that as it
will, I had not left every thing unfoftened; becaute the Difference would
then have been to great, that the Piece muft have had too much Near-
nets; fince irs certain, that as Objects go off they become more uncer-
tain. The fmall and fubile Things, luch as fmall Folds and Features,
difappear; yet the Painting might well be faid to be finithed; fince e
very Thing was in it that ought to be, with respect to its Distance.
I had before painted the fame Delign, for a Model of that above;
was laid on flat and not in the leaft loffened; whereby the Difference
between them was very vifible: Now I mult own, that foftening is ve-
ry alluring, and has an apparent Distance; however we may always.
perceive, that the one has as much Force as the other.

greater Force and Motion than in common Light; which fome ima-

gine, proceed oply from the Sharpnets of the Shades: Nowg irlis: to,
in some Meafure, with respect to their Broadness, but principally: for
the Plainness of the Ground hades which the Objects caft on each other;
whereby Thingsare often broke and divided in fuch a Manner as if all
ire deable; even lix Figures in a common Light will not fometimes
give to many Pieces as four in Sum fune: Whence we may plainly per-
ceive, that Sampneys grves a Nearness, foftening more and more as the
Objects go off; to that no Objects whatever can thew any Sharpness un-
tys they ire Mir; becaute of the Air interpoling between us and them:
If this seem strange and unincelligible, a due Inquiry will make it ev:
dent; Wherefore fargue, that the nearer the Objects, the more plain
and fudden are their Shades; for as lets Hir interpofes between us and the
neared, to it muit increate in Proportion as they go off
Here it will not be unneceifary to relate a particular Accident, as a
Contirmation of my Aftertion. I have formerly faid, that in my
Vouth I made many Deligns in Watercolours: Now I had one Time,
among others, painted one, which, by reafon of its farved and hard
Penciting, I fo diiliked, that I purpoted to try to give it a better
Face, tho' I were to tpoil it inirely. Firt, Irried it with the Glare
of an Esg; which not fucceeding. I fixed it on Paftboard, and
made a Brim of Wax round it; then I poured clear ifinglats on it,
and let it dry: By which means the Painting became as neat and
toff as poffible; and, thewing it to one of my Incimates, he was to
furprized, that he could hardly believe it to be the fame Piece, be
caufe the Body of the Kinglats had taken away the aforefaid Hun
griness and Hardness. But afterwards, on inquiring into the Na-
tures of Things, this Experiment appeared not firange or wonderful to
He
By this Occurrence 1 would intimate, that Mill or Hir takes away
all Shargness; making Things gross and rough feem light and fmooth,
like a Vernith or Gluegloffing every Thing in Nature before our Eyes.
Touching Objects lighted by the Sun, they cannot, by Means of
Rrong and dark Shades, and with Tellowisness only, look natural or fim-
ay; becaute there is no Difference between this, and other Lights, with
respect to Force; I mean in Objectslets than the Life. The Sharp-
nets of broad Shades, and the Forms of Ground-shades, with the Co
lour of the Light, and their Rellexions, how weak foever, can natu
rally effect it: But Objects as big as the Life are beyond our Power,
if they were only to confift in Force. Now, fome may paffibly fay,
that then it is the better to be represented in Little: To. which I mull

15 certain, that the Groundfhades in Sun-fhine (which contribate
much to the Decorum of a Picture) confiff not only of Length,
Broadness and Sharpnels, but in a Conformity with the Objects
which caufe them, whether Pillar, Pyramid, Square, Coc. The
Ground-sbade of an upright flanding Figure, falling on the Ground or
any thing elfe, must be perfertly seen; even to much, that tho' the said
Object were not feen, or were hid behind fomething, yet we may
judge, by its Ground-hade, what Shape it has; which is one of the
principal Tokens of Sun-thine. Some think this no great Matter; and
that when they have ftruck, on the Ground, a long Stripe of a certain
Breadth, that is fufficient, without shewing whether it be the Shadow
of a Pillar or a Man.
Speaking of this, I cannot omit mentioning a Blunder of a certain
great Mafter. He had reprefented a St. Francis in the Wildernels, on
his Knees at Praver, with extended Arms before a Crucifix, as he
is generally exhibited. The Piece in itfelf was very fine; but cafting
my Eyes on the Crucifix (which was compofed of small Twigs of
Trees) I perceived, that it made a diffinct Shade of the whole on the
Ground, tho' was almoft balf in the Shade of the Saint. But what
more furprifed me, was, that his Body with the Arms in the same Po
fition as the Crucifix, but ten times bigger, did not caf a like Sbade
on the Ground, but the Shade of a Mass or Block, without Arms.
Now, we have faid before, that tho' a Figure or other Object be
hidden behind fomeching, yet we can judge, by the Groundshade,
what Shape or Form it bas; as 1 shall thew in few Words: For inftance,
place a Perfon in a Palace or Apartment, behind a Pillar, or the like,
and let him be lighted by the Sun; his Shape will plainly be feen on
the Ground, by his Shadow. Again, would you introduce into a
Landskip, a Pyramid, Tower, of Bulwark, which is not there, it may
be done by means of the Ground hade, when it falls into the Piece
from the Side of the Light; whereby the Objects, and every thing be
longing to them, will be plainly vifible.

Ingeious Pritters of Sun frine have still an fidvantage above others,
that they need not make any high Trees, Hills or Buildings, in order
to create here or there large Groundfhades, for bringing forwards
Fore-objects, and flinging off Hinder ones: they order their Shades
where they think proper, and can always fupport their fo doing with
Reafons; becaute we often fee, in Sun-fhine, a fmall driving Cloud
Shadow a whole Piece of Ground, and another Ground shall be light
again; and to feveral behind one another: Thus they can divide a
Field, at pleafure, into Lights and Shades, in order to thew Things a.
greeably.
I have, with great Attention, obferved the Colour and Shades of
the Suns Light, and found (especially in the Month of September, a
bout 2 er s in the Afternoon, when the Sun is ftrongeft) that the Sky
has a clear blue Colour, intermixed with small driving Clouds. As for
the Objects, when the Sun Chines flrong, they appear, as if heighten
ed with red Orpiment and Whire, and the Shades reddith Grey; as
White, Black and a little brown Red mixt together; not uniting with
the Blue as in common Light, as some imagine, but becoming gradu-
ally a liitle more Violet, and growing famter towards the Horizon,
where no Blue is to be feen. The Treeson the fore and second Grounds
appear finely green: The Blue of the Objects is greenith; the Red, is
Orange colonr; the Violet, Ruffet; and thus all the Colours in Pro-
portion: Deep ltater thone on becomes greenith Grey. This exact
Obfervation agreed perfectly with what I had formerly experiment
ed, in a bright Sun-thine, by means of a fmall Hole in the Window
of a darkened Room; by which I faw naturally on the white Wall,
as on Paper, the Reffexion of every thing that was moving without-
doors.
But let us proceed further to confider, whether mit Chapen Shadows
do not make Objects unintelligible. Beaury in general, fublifting either
in Figures, Landship of other Objects, exhibius all things plain and
diftinct in their Shapes and Forms, without Dimination or breaking
then; for Things contrary to each other cannot poffibly raife an
agreeable Beauty in our Eyes, nor convey to the Sentes a true Idea of
their Forms, unless by a Medium, confifting of a second or middle
Tinr, which unites the two contrary Parts, namely Light and Shade,
when they come too sharp on each other; thereby to foften the De-
formity on the Objefts, and to unite them: 1 fpeak of Things
which are the broud; which makes round Objelts, inflead of look

fore they appear not beautiful but mif hapen: And the Reafon is
plain; People are not fenlible of any other Deroram than what oc-
cors to their Eyes. For its certain, that Things alter by the leall
Accident, whether of unufral Lights or Shades, which make them
frange and unkhown. Let fome boatt, that is broad and the bett
Manner; I maintain, that tho' it were a Sun-thine, it is all one and
the fame: And if we are to fpeak of what is agreeable and perfect, 1
tay, that it ought to be known; that a Pitture with a common Light is
the most perfect; a Light which fiews as more exactly and plain the pre-
per Forms of Objects; what is round, remaining fo, and the Square alrer-
ing not. As for the Mifhapes of Things exhibited in San-thine, we
have fufficiently thewed them; as alfo, that the Sharpnets of deformed
Shades spbils ifie true Propercy of the Objects; for Inftance, fuppofe
two flanding Figures, talking together, are lighted by the Sun; if now
the one call a Shade on the other, to as half to cover his Face, we need
not doubt, but he will becomelels Known, even where he d Parent.
in Arcbiteffure or Mouldings it happens as bad; becaute the ofen-
five Sharpness of the Shades distigures and confules their Form and Neat-
Rets at Once.
I think it therefore a Sign of Pufillanimity (not to fay Cowardice)
in a Landskip-painter, always to make Choice of Sunfhine; which is
certainly but a fmall Part of his Arc: As if an Architect were to be
continually imployed about a Cheff or Box; a Flower-painter, about 2
Flowerglats; a Cattle-painter, about a Cow or Sheep; a Still-life Pain-
ter, about a Scull or Hourglass; a Sea-painter, about a Sloop or Boat;
of a Statuary, about a Crucifix. He is no Hiffory-painter, who al.
ways repreients an Herodins with a St. John’s Head in a Charger; or 4
Lacretia Rabbing herfelf; or a Tael with an Hammer, or a St. Toon
with a Lamb; all which are but particular Incidents, which fcarce de-
ferve a Name: An Arriff therefore mult not. be afraid to exhibit every
Thing that can be repretented with every Sort of Light.
But the Opinion of molt Paincers of Sun Chine, is as ridiculous as that
of thote who always practife a common Light; boch proceeding from
a Millake or Ignorance, whereby they cannot rightly judge of Things
diftering from what they have been always uted to: Now, their Judg:
ment is only a Conclution agreeing with their Apprehcations in a Poilt
which they precend to undertland, and which therefore ought to be thus
and thus; when yet it's certain, that before we can judge of Things,
we ought firft to inquire into them, and, by a Comparifon between boib,
to observe wherein they differ.

That Sun fhine is not to proper for Hiftory as for Landskip and Ar-
chirelture, arifes from heace; that, on fuch Occafions, it is obftructing,
and appears hard and unpleafant, by Reafon of the Sharpnets of the
Shades and Ground hades, as we have before incimated; neverthelets,
if the Matter require it, it muft be uled; yet with fuch Caution, that
no mit Chapen Ground pades appear to obttrult the Sight, or create an
Averfion
But if Sun fhine were the beft and moff advantageous Light, Face-
painters would certainly ule no other; of which, to this Day, we have
not one inftance; becaute firft, the Colours do not fhew themfelves in
that Light to be what they really are.
Secondly, Becaule is impoffible, that either Man, Woman or Child,
can, without Trouble and an Alteration of Countenance, especially a.
Dour the Eyes and Mouth, fir any Time with their Faces in the Sun.
Thirdly, Becaufe the Sunnever flands sill, but is always altering.
Fourthly, Becaule the Sweetnets of the Features would thereby be
poiledatonce. And,
Laftly, Becaufe it would be very improper to hang fuch Pictures in
a Roomout of which the Sun is kept.
II would be ridiculous and abfurd, to fay of a Woman, that the is
unlike a Man, unlets they to refemble that we can fee no Difference be
tween them; for as the Woman is like a Woman, and the Man like a
Man, to there muft needs follow one of thefe Conclutions, to wit, that
he cannot or will not Beeir: We could add a third, as a Contempt of
the Woman, namely, that the is not incirely like a Man: But this laff
(Which arrends moft People's Judgments) is moft ridiculous, and to be
especially thunn’d by thofe of right Apprehention, as being often the
Source of Hatred and Envy, and even Ruin, as Experience daily thews
in those, who, thro' Prepolfeffion, defpife every thing that's difagree
able to their Work and Fancy.
I shall not enlarge on this Point, but keep to my Purpofe, of thew-
ing the Prepoffetfion of Sun-thine- Painters, as well as others: And, to be
the becter underftood, premife, that there are three Things wherein the
Whole Matter contifts, and which we muft firft fix, and diflindly ob
ferve; namely, a Sunshine, a common Light, and a faint Light, which
differ from each other as much in Fact as Name.
The firft is grong and shurp, the second bread, but not sharp; and the
third, faint and mekting.
The firft caufes di hintt Groundshades; the second makes melting ones;
and the third, faint ones.

The firfl receives irs Colour from the sun; the second, from the
Cloads; and the third, from the Blse of the Sky.
We will fubjoin, that the firft may be confidered as a Man; the fe-
cond, as a Woman; and the third, as a Child.
Who will now fay, that the Child is not good, becaule is not to lut
ty, frong and bright as the Father or Mother; or that the Woman is
not fo, becaute the is not intirely like a Man?
Obferve then, how thefe unthinking Sun fhine Painters judge further
of the second and third Lights: It is not broad, fay they; whereby,
weare to underfland, that tis not fo funny and Charp in Shades as in
their Paintings: Broad, Broad I they fpeak to their Difciples in to
low a Tone, that no Stranger muft hear it; as if it were a Secret unknown
to the very Art lis faid that the good Pbilemon was to bigorted to
Things having broad Lights and Shades, that he never painted other
than Sun or Moon-light-pieces; which he evidenced, in exercing his
whole Force to reprelent Tupiter with ffemena; where they are both
seen going to Bed, and yet the Sun thines to bright into the Room,
that you might count all the Squares of the Window on the Floor.
Poor Tupiter ! How violently are you dealt withl Dares Phabus, con-
trary to your express Cemmands, peep thro' the Windows, the you charg-
ed him to bide for three Days and three Nights? But what signifies that,
thinks the Painter; the Painting muft be broad, and the Sumshine muft
be there, were it Midnight. Had he made a Moonlight, it would
have fitted that Seaton
But it fares with fuch Artifts as it did with one, who was fo fond of
Painting Oranges, that he never made a Piece without one. This Zea-
lot, having made interelt to paint the Battle of Pavia, asked his im
ployer, whether there should not be an Orange in it? Hew should tbat
come to pass? fays the Gentleman: Topass, or not, replied the Painter,
let me alone for that : The other laughed; and not dreaming he would
put one in, aftertalking of other Things, faid, at parting—Do asyou
think beft: The poor Man, glad of the Authority, was looking in his
Picture for a Place for the Orange; but fearful; if he placed to fine a
Fruiton the Ground, it might be trampled on by the Horfes, he con-
trived a small square Stone in a Corner of the Painting, and fet thereon,
in a Pewter-plate, an Orange as big as the Life, and very naturally
done. This innoceat Wretch (for luch deferve not the Name of Pain-
ters) gives us to underfland, that what we can do beft, is beft, whetber

H1 S Propoficien may peffibly feem flrange to fome, and per-
haps a Feint; but is, in Fact, to far from it, or being a Tritle,
that tis a Matter of Moment, and founded on good Reaforns.
We take ir for granted, that the Sun differs in Force from other
Lights, and is a Tint lighter.
Weather abounding with driving
We often fee, in changeable
Cfouds, that the Sun is obfcured by very thin and hanging airy Va-
Dours in fuch Aianner, that whole Tralts of Land, Howles, Hills,
Cc. even whole Woods are over-fhadowed: Which. Shades however
are thin, and exhibit all the Objects more or lets plain than in com-
mon Light.
But let us come to the Point; which is, to reprefent, in a Common-
light-piece, a Sun-fhine with one and the fame Force of Colonrs, each
in its Degree, without Impedimet to each other; I mean, when the
Sun is not forward or in the Front of the Picture, or is not too much
fpread, which would thereby feem too flaring.
To do it therefore according to the Rules of rt, divide, for In
ftance, a Landskip into four Grounds; of which, let the firft be
Whire, and the three others diminithing in Proportion: Let the
fecond Whire ground ferve for the Sun-fhine: Now, tis plain, that as
the common Light on the Fore ground alrerdy pefeffes the Force of
the Coloars, it muft needs follow, that the Sunffune, which is one
Iint lighter, as before faid, and has no other Force than the fame
White, can alfo have no nearer Place than that of the fecond Ground:
A plain Proof, that, if it be placed on the third Ground, ir will dit

for to much more in Force. Now, in order to diftingwith the Ditte
rence between this Light on the second Ground, and that on the firfl
and to reprefent it narurally, we ought to exhibit the Shades and
Ground shades of the Objects, parp, broud and long; whereby we may

perceive, that this is a Sunlight; and the other, with dall and pert
Groundshades, to thew that it's commen Light. But the better to con
ceive the Nature of Sun-light, obferve its Colour in the Morning and
Evening.
To aid thofe who may not prefencly underlland what I have faid,
I thall lay down a fhort Method of Management in a certain and ealy
Manner.
Having sketch’d your Delign, and fetiled the Parts which you would
have enlightened by the Sun, dead colour it neatly, as if it were to
be throughout 2 common Light: But in the fecond Colouring, you
mult fomawber mere beighten the Parts which are lighted by the Sun;
whether whiter, more yellow or more ruffet, according as you would
have them, and to as to perceive a visible Diference: The Shades allo
to he mere diffint and bread, without making them glowing, except
here and there in the Reffexions.
Now, if on the Fore ground, or about it, there be no White, we
have an Opportunity to throw here and there on it some Sunrays by
the Force of White, Fellow or Ruflet, according as the Suns Colour
then appears; which could not be done; if we had before laid the Suns
Force in the Offskip.
Here, let it be obferved, that if we enlighten some forward Objects
by the Rays aforefaid, they ought not to be of Ligbt, and bright-co-
loured Marrer, fuch as whice Marble or light Free ftone, very light
Draperies, or beautiful Carnations; but of fuch Tints as appear dark
in a common Light; becaute thefe frongly heightened with the Sun-
like Whice will teech out the same Light,
Now, to finith the Work with Certainty, and to find, with Eate,
the proper Tints of Objects, lighted by the Sun, proceed thus. Tem-
per your White with red or yellow Orpiment, more or less Tellow, as
you would reprefent the Sun early or late. Then, inflead of pure
White, mix it with your light firff Tints of all the Objects which are
lighted by the Sun: Whereupon you will find each Colour to be
broke according as its Qvality or Force, with respect to its Body, dif-
fers much or little from the reft. Thus the Work will have the de-
tired Effect, as Experience, the Daughber of Irath, can reftity.

CHAP. IX. That the Sbades of Objects in Sunshine are not more
i
glowing than in common Light.

5
A NY are fuch Strangers to the Truth of Things, and to
V iide enquire inco them, that, to retain their groundless Ha-
bits, they flight Reafons, and maintain their Erroys. This is
evident from their univerfal Opinion, that the Shades aff Objects are
more glowing in Sim-hine than in common Light: Which I intirely
deay; but that the Shades and Reffexions become lighter and lighter,
in Proporton as the Sun Chines Rronger, is true.
That the Suns Light is more glowing than a common one, is indif
putable; for, as the Suns Light is more or less Vellow or Red, tis
natural, that every Thing he thines on should partake of the same Colour,
not only in Lights, burallo in the Shades which receive the Reffexions
of the Grounds, and other near Objects: But, as there are no Objects
what firong Reffexions foever they receive) which do not here and there
preferve some un reffected Shades (as, when one Object is covered by the
Ground-Lhade of another) to the said Shades ought, fince they have no
Communication with the Sun or his Reffexions, and are of another Na-
ture, to be moregrey, like thofe in common Light, as receiving no Co.
lour bit what the Airgives them.
Hereby, I think, we can beft diffinguith between a Sum thine and com-
mon Light; wherefore is ftrange, that People, who commonly feek
Shades for the Sake of Coolness, will notwichttanding hove them warm.
Tis therefore no wonder to find to few Winter-painters. I have
teen Winter-pieces of Brengel as warmly coloured as if for Midsummer;
even the very lee and Snow as glowing; tho' in Winter all Things re-
ceive light Refiexions, and have little of no Shade, the Ground-fhades
are lighrith and blue, and yet every Thing has it's Diftance and Going
off; tho' fome, contrarily, make their Off-fhades as warm as the for
ward ones
For this Reafon, Tis neceftary for the Artiff fometimes to exercile
himself in Sun-fhine, and make due Obfervations on the Narure of it;
not making it his conflant Praltice, but a particular and agreeable Study:
If he cannot be perfect in it, he ought at leaft to know as much of it
as of common Light, in order to ule, in his Works, fomerimes the one,
fometimes the other, as Occation requires Some think, becaute of

the Broadness, that Sun-thine is more eafy than common Light: But it
is not fo; lince I think it as difficult, for a Sun-thine Painter to repre
feat common Light, as a Common light Painter to exhibit SunChine,
with respect to Nacuralness. Many, perhaps may differ from me in
Opinion, becaufe, in Sun fhine, the Groundshades are diffintt and li-
mited. Whence, they deduce this Argument; that in a Piece lighted
intirely from a Side, and the Sun having Meridian Alcirude, the
Groundfhades of all the Objects appear a third lets than their full
Length, and therefore they may be correctly meafured by the Com
pafles, each in Proportion to its Length, on to the Offship: Which I
willingly grant, and to which I will fay further in their Favour, that
is to be practifed, not only when the Grounds are level and horizon
tal, but likewife in Up and Down grounds, where the Compalies are
utelets; if the Ground drip, the GroundfFades will do the fame; does
itrife, they do to too; as the Knowing in Perspective well underfland;
thus far, I fay, they are in the Right: But fuppofe it thould happen,
that the Piece be lighted from within, or from without; Is it not thes
as uncertain as in common Light, and, becaute the Compaffes are ufe
less, much more troublefome to find the Shades and Ground:hades,
and their Enlargements forwards and Offdiminations; which ought to
be as fentible as the Sun is either off or forward? Contrarily, How
ealy is it in common Light, where they are small and dull? The Task
is therefore not to ealy as fome imagine, who endeavour only to re-
prefent a Right or Lett fide thade. To reprefent the Sun in all Pofitions
is quite another Thing, and there are few fuch Painters: For we do
not eafily find, a Sunthine-painter meddle with common Light; but
contrarily, that a Commonlight Painter will fometimes practife Sum
thine; and the Reafon is plain, the common Light takes in every Thing;
wherefore, he who underflands this well, can eafily give inco Sun-thinc.
The Point is only, that Sun-fhine is warm in the Lights, but not in the
Shades, as fome imagine.
Now it fometimes happens, that two Pieces, a Sun fhine, and a
common Light, hang together, both having the utmoll Force of Co-
louring, and to alike, as hardly to diflinguily the Sun-thine; the Lights
being in both alike and broad (for fince the Word Broad is come into
Fathion, some will paint bread, whether it be Sun-thine, or not, as
well within doors as without; moreover, the Lights and Shades warm. )
What now is to be done, when two fuch Pictures muft hang together.
in order to diftinguish the Sun fhine Nothing edia verily; than to abate
the Strength of the one fomewhat, and heighten the Force of the o

bright Light, with long and diffinet Ground shades, not only broad,
but Barg. I underfland here, that the Common light piece ought not
to be inferior in Goodness in its Kind; but not broadlighted or sha-
ded, unlets the Caule plainly appears.
Bur we feldom fee too fuch Piecestogether, done by the fame Mafter;
becaute moll Painters make but one of the Kinds their Bufiness: And
if it once happen, yet they do not think, the one ought to be lighter
than the other. And if they are done by two different Hands, each
Mafter endeavours to make the Colours anfver his own Inclination.
Thus it happens, that the Sun fhine Painters are in little Concern a.
bout it; for they think — Are my Objefts to appear by the Force of
Light; I will, by the Strength of fiery Shades, maintain the Superierity.
We have faid before, that, in Proportion to the Suns Strength, the
Reffexions become lighter; the Reafon whereof we shall now explain
We find, when the Sun is low, and the Objects are firongly lighted,
that they receive flrenger Reffexions from each other; becaute the Suns
Rays fall not obliquely and glancing on the Objects, and thofe on others,
Dut ffrike directly upon them, and return Reffexions: Contrarily, when
the Sun is high, the Reffections of the lighted Objects cannot touch the
others with fuch a Force, becaute the Reffexion of the Light mutt
Heeds revert to iis Origin: For Inftance, if in an high Light, two Men
fland in Difcourfe, and the one receive the Sun on his Breaft, and the
other on his Back, the Light which falls from on high on the Breall,
muff needs reflect again upwards, whence it came, and therefore pats
over the others Head; to that the former Figure can thereby receive
hone, of but a very weak and almoff imperceptible Reffexion.
Thus I think to have thewn, that Reffexions in Sun-thine ought to
be reprefented much fronger than in common Light; the Proof of
which may be deduced from the Life itfelf.




CHAP. X. Of the Difference of Ground shades, preceeding either
from the Sun, or radial Point.
N PIste XXXVl the firft Example thews the Suhs Place of
Quarter, which I obferve as Eafl; and opposite to it, in the Wel,
is a Building, which is lighted throughout from the Eall, not 23
by Rays, proceeding from a Point and growing wider, but by fuch as

are parallel to each other; I mean, not from the Ceater of an affigned Sun
at the Side of the Piece, but from the whole Quarter wherein the Sun
is; or from the whole side of the Piece, as wide as the Opening, thro'
which he thines into it.
The second Example thews the contrary to be falfe; when the Sun
being directly behind the Objects, the Groundhades are not ferch’d
from the Radial, but another Point.
For if this were good, it mult follow, that when the Sun fhines di-
rectly thro' the middle of a Street, he would enlighten both Sides
of it; which is contrary to Nature, and to what we have shewed
before. And
in the third Example, tis plainly vifible, that when the Sun is in
the Eall, and the Room in the Well, the Objelts on the Ground muft
needs be lighted directly from behind, as well the one as the other,
without the leaff Difference: Which their Ground-thades and the Lines
of the Floor fufficienly thew, both proceeding from the Point of
Sight, and the latter shewing us the Eall and Weff through the whole
Room.
The fourth Example in Plate KKKVIl. affirms the fame; repre
fenting a Southern Colonade lighted direct by the Sun, which is in the
oppofite Point; of which Bunding each Column throughout calls its
Shade againtt the Pillar behind it, not proceeding from a Point, but
by Parallels, according to the Rules of Perspective.
The fitth Example contrarily thews a great Miltake, which yet is
often committed, in making the Ground-shades proceed from an aftirned
Point, each Column feeming to caufe a particular Ground shade; which
is against Rule, and the Nature of Sun-fhine.
it will not be amiss to fay fomething here of the Light of Grounds,
to wit, that in what Manner foever the Light comes, whether from
behind, fideways or fronting, the Plan or Ground will always appear
alike; that is, in the Front of the Piece, the moft Light, be the Sun
ever to low, nay, on the Horizon: And not only the flat Grounds,
but every thing that receives Light: The Reafon whereof is to evi-
dent, that it would be superfluous to fay any thing more about it, than
whats shewn in the fixth Example of a fide, froming and backward
Light, which Perspective fufficiently jultifies.
if some think, that when the Light comes from behind or a fide,
the Ground mult be lighted otherwife than fronting (for many keep
it always moft Light on the side whence the Light proceeds) I allow
it, with respect to a Candle or Torch; but, (peaking of the Air, muf

fay, they do nor at all underfland the Mitter: Indeed it would not be
very improper in a Ground running off from the Light: But level
Floors or Grounds cannot admit of a Diminution were they, if I may
Tay fo, a thouland Sceps long; nay, the Ground will always be moft
figbt forwards, without any Difference, let the Light come from be-
hind or forwards. I think, no Arriff will be to foff as to ask, how
then it shall appear whence the Light comes ? Since tis a general
Rule, that the Shades and Ground-hades of the Objects plainty thew

there be but the leaff Cloud, will make it fufficiently apparent.

CH AP. XI. Of the Representation of different Lights in the same
Piece.
1OME think ir impoffible for different Lights in the same Piece
A) to look well; for, fay they, if it were good, Raphact, Caracer,
Tition, Pouffin and other great Mafters would not have rejected,
but approved that Manner; even the French Hcademy, which is arriv-
ed at to high a Pirch, unanimoutly agrees, that no more than a fingle
Ligbt is necelfary, and rejects a Picture which has more; wherefore
they judge, that double Lights are only the Inventions of Dutch Maf
fers, who do not underfland the Antigue, but only follow Nature in
order to pleafe Ignorants. To all which 1 antwer, that tho' Rappact,
Poxfrm, and other great Mafters, have not thewed it in their Works,
but only kept a fingle and common Light, we muff not infer from
thence, that they defpited or rejected that Manner, as contrary to Na-
ture, but they neither thought nor knew it, Art not being, in their
Times, got to its Perfection in this Particular: Ver I do not fay, that
2 Piece with different Lights is better than one fingle-lighted, if naw
rally reprefented; I mean only, that if it to fall outand be judiciouly
managed, it gives a Painting a diverfifying Elegance.
I believe, many common Painters will not much thank me for dit
clofing this Matter; becaute, should Lovers defire fuch a Piece, they
would have more Trouble in doing it. However, ler every Man do
what he will, or can. It fares with our Art as with others, if a Man
will learn all thars neceitary, to become a good Mafter, he may do
to; or if he be content with Half-inquiries, no body will call him in
Croftion for ir; But he who is able to repretent a fingle Light well

may, in my Opinion, alfo do the others well. How many brave
Malters furmount every thing they undertake? What should hinder
their exhibiting three or four Lights as well as one? But, let me not
here approve the Manner of some Landskip-painters, who introduce
many small Lights into a Piece. A fond Conceit without any Bafis.
I thought it proper to handle this Marter of different Lights, to
thew, that we ought not to regard the partial Opinions of Ignorants.
but always chule what is moft natural and agreeable; I mean, that we
should enrich our Ordonnances in general according to Occation, and
without Affectation. For which Purpofe we shall here exhibit an Ex-
ample with different Lights, Plate XXKVill. in Expeltation to hear
what Difficulties some will raife againt it.
We fee here a Building or Gallery; and before it, a Mote of Water,
on the Brink whereof is a Man faftening a Boat. Near the Water
lies an Heap of various Kinds of Houlhold-Goods. Two Men are feen
bringing forwards some imall Veffels on a Bier. On the Pavement
Hands a grave Matron with a young Virgin, directing the hindermoft
Porter to lay the Goods to the refl. Somewhat decper in the Piece are
two Soldiers; one bare headed, carrying fome Houhold -Gods. A
Servant is coming down the Steps with an heavy Cheft on his Shoulder.
Through an Arch of this Gallery is feen, at the further End of a.
Field, a Garden afcended by 20 or 20 Steps, inclofed on each Side by
a green Hledge. Some People are feen going up and down the Steps..
In the Field firs an Herdlman with a Dog near a Stone. The Fore-
part A, with all the Objects thereabouts, is little lighted forwards..
yet Rrongly. The Gallery B, and the Figures on the same Ground are
lighted directly from the Side. Every thing in the Field D, is lighted.
like A. The Sceps C, and the Objects on them are lighted forward.
A receives it's Light from South-Egf; B from South; C from Eqt,
and D, like A, from South-Eqt.
I appeal now to Men of Judgment, whether the Lights ought not
to differ from each other as well in Tints as Sades. A, and the
FieldD, to the Steps, receive, as aforefaid, their Light from South
Ealt; in which Point I fuppofe the Sun to be; wherefore the Air is
there lighteff. The South an the right Side, which lights the Gallery
only through an Opening, thereby becomes a Ettle darter than the Fore-
part of the Piece. The Steps C in the Offskip, covered by the Right-
lide-Iedge from South and South Eall, and by the left, from North,
mull needs receive their Light from Eall, and the Air over Head;
whence, we may perceive that the Objects are never witheut Light;,
poui-

bowever they are incompaffed; fince what they lofe on one Side, they
gain on the other.
I exhibit here another Deliga, Plate KKKIK. alfo tending to thew
different Lights in the Jume Piece.
Let us confider it as a Square Room, which can receive it's Light
from the four Cardinal Pomes: For Inftance, we fuppofe A, to be
North; BEalt; C South, and DWel; again, No. 1, to be North-
Eaft; 2, South Ealt; 3, South-Welt, and 4, North-Weff: Between
thefe Points are, South-South Eaft, Eaft North-Eall, Coc. which are
needless. Now, we ought to obferve, this Room being open on the
four Sides, and a Figure flanding on a Pedeftal in the Middle of it,
and lighted from the four Sides, from which Side it would receive
ir's firongell Light: Certainly from the Eaff, where the Sun is; and
next, South Eall; North-Ealt, a Tint less; then, North and South,
Hill a Tintdarker; and to the fame with South-Well and North-Well.
The Wel Side only should be the Shade.
Br thefe Examples I think to have fufficiently cleared the Point
touching the Natures and Effects of different Lights; and alfo shewed
the Advantage of knowing them, as well in Sun-fhine as com-
mon Light, with respect to the Variety either in Landskip or
other Subjects; together with the abundant Means they afford for
cariching an Ordonnance, and that above the common Method. I fub-
join, that in a judicious Ufe of them, we muft be very careful in their
Difpolition, that they may not, as I have faid, seem forced, but natural
and neceffary, that there be a general Union, and that the Principal
Part have it's Predeminancy.
C H A P. Xil. Curious Observations on Sun-shine.
H A VE already faid much touching Sunthine, and yet, as a
Matter of Confequence for Hiftory and Landskip- painters, shall,
from three Deligns (which for that Purpofe 1 exhibit) make a gene-
ral Obfervation upon it; and thereby thew the Miltakes of fome and
the good Qualines of others, as a Precedent for thofe who would
get Honour by Living Embellifhments.
Three young Painters had once a Controverfy about the Repreten
tation of Sun fhine: They were each of different Tempers; one, cross
and politive; another, meek and of good judgment, and the third
was by the others generally accounted filly. in the End, they re-
folved,

solved, each to make an Ordonnance; and to thew their Skill, the
two firft chofe one and the fame Delign. See the Sketches in Plate
XI.
The firfl had given all the Objects, without Diffinction, a yellowith
Light, and made the Shades firong and glowing; thereby precending
to express the Sun as fetting; not confidering that he thereby expoted
his ignorance, as having made the Ground-thades too thort.
The second had expreft the Shades and Groundfhides not to Charp
or to long; as repretenting the Sun much higher, and a little fainter;
yet herein thewed to much more Conduct, on making the Woman and
Boy, who are looking at an Huntlman founding his Horn over the
Wall (whom the Man coming out of the Gare thews them) pur their
Hands over their Eyes, as Nature teaches; when the other, who had
repretented the Sun much sronger, had not taken any Notice of that Cir-
cumflance.
The firft placed a Man before the Tree, sleeping in the Sun; The
second, contrarily had placed him in Shade behind the Tree; and
tome other People were fitting in Repofe againtt the Wall, in Shade,
to avoid the Sun's Heat.
The third, had made a Delign of his own (fee Plate XLl. to thew
his nice Obfervations on the Sun; which the others, as counting him
filly, at firft laught at. He had reprefented a naked Boy, firting in an
open Window, and making Bubbles with a Pipe. The Child received
his Light forward from the common Light of the Room. Thro' the
Window appeared the Tops of fome Houfes, and a Part of a Column
with a Sun-dial affixed to to.
Now, on a nice Examination, it appeared, that this latt had bett
bellowed his Thoughts on the Sun, and that neither of the others
had thewn to many good Effects in their Pieces, as he, in to small a
Compats; For, firft, he exhibited the Colour of Sun-fhine in the Sky
and on the Tops of the Houles, fufficiently differing from the common
Light: Secondly, &is not enough to reprefent the Sun ftrong or weak,
or with long or thort Ground-hades, but we mult allo fee, by the
Ground-hades, bow late it is; wherefore he had incroduced the Sun-
dial, the Ground-fhade whereof was on 9: Thirdly, he had obferved
the Dubiousness of the edgy Obietts going off: And lattly, to shew
that we cannot bear the Sun’s exceffive Brightness without doors, he had
placed the Child in the Window, in the common Light of the Room,
that he might, with more Liberty, Rare about at the Bubbles than
he could in the bright open Air. Thus he juftified the Condult of

CH A P. XIIl. Of the Suns three Qualities.
S we ought not only to view, as far as we are able, the Won.
ders of Narure, but allo to reprefent their Likeness; So we

shall now make our Obfervations about the moft beautiful of
Things.
Wtho can be infentible of the three Qualities of the Sun, viz. his
Splender, Hest and Colour? Can any Light exceed the Sun in Bright
nets and Clearnels, or any Fire be more invigorating or confuming, or
ant Colour have greater Power ?
The Sunbeams, fays a certain Poet, penetrate the Depth of the Sea,
and render the fundy Grounds ligbt; imperceptible Things, sensible, &cc.
what Light can effect what this does! It is faid that Lightening can
blind the Eyes; tho' this be rather cauted by its Suddenness than its
Light.
As for the Sun’s Hear, Ovid tells us, that, Phacton being of an am-
bitious Temper infortuned his Father to let him drive the Chariot of the
Sun; which Regset bring granted, and the Herses proving tso bead sirong,
and be, ignerant of the Course, driving out of the Way, thereby fet the

in relation to the third Quality the Poet proceeds thus: Phabus,
lays he, in his light Hair, and sitting in a glittering Ckarict befet
with Carbuncles, gilds all things, be shines on, with a gellowip Colour.
What Light has juch a Brightness and beautiful Colour? What Salt-
fetre, Brimsone or other combultible Matter canreach so far, and spread
from Eal to Weft? The white Moon and Sparkling Stars, nay the
fulden Lightnings themselves are all weak and faint, if compared with
the absolute Beanty and Splender of his lively Colour.
I therefore very much wonder, that fuch an Ignorant can be found
as I met with about gor 6 Years ago. Even he, who fat up for a
great Mafter, plainly afferred, that the Sun is Blue, may, asure Bluc.
Was there ever harboured a more abfurd Opinion, than one which
makes the moft trankcendent Brightnels and most penetraring Object,
the weskgr2 Since every one knows, Blse to be the weakeff of all Co-
lours, and by which every thing is madeto recuc. What Light can be
drawn from Bluc? Does a bluc Eody produce Green, Red or Fellow ?
Ves, lazs Momas, a Flue Objett will caj a Tillvwifness; a gellow
Light, a Elue one; and a ked, a beauriful Grein: Af0, a jellow
Drapery will give a green Roffexien; a biue Dragery a red ene; and
white, a black one. Mercorer, the Light of the Sun is wellexpret, wken
the main Lights are whitish Blae, and the Reffexions gellow and searm.
Thus, fays he, we mut reason about all Colours lighted by the Sun.
I think this the blueft Policion that can be; For, in painting the
Sun and all other Objects after this Manner, could there be a more
ridiculous Picture? How green, yellow, blue, and sported would it
appear? — But many are fond of Party-colouring.
We shall give here a Delcription of one of this Mafter's Pictures;
a Work as frivolous as his Judgment about the Sun.
in this Piece he had reprefented. a Vulcan hammering a Piece of
Iron, a Foot long; one half whereof was red hot, and the other he
held in his Hand: He had allo exhibired a Finus, with the fame
Precaution, fitting ftarknaked and unconcern’d in the midlt of the
Sparks.
Now, are not thefe fine Thoughts, and worthy of Reprefentation?
Does he not feem to fay— This hon is not beated by the Fire, bus
painted of a glowing Colour 2— And indeed he thews it plainly; for
the Pincers, which Futean ought to hold the lron by, lie by him on
the Ground. Moreover he was foolith enough to paint a Fire againtt
an Hanging. But why do we wonder ar that? Why should he not do
it? Since a painted Fire cannot burn. We might fuppole him as wile

as the Man who fer a Piece of lee to dry in the Sun, that it might not
wer his Back in carrving home.
To find fuch Wreckes among mean People is truly no Wonder;
Dir among Painiers, and such as fer up for great Mafters, tis palt my
Cerllandng.
Thole Mea, who are uracquainted with the true Qualities of the
Sun, may be excuted; but they, who know, fee and are fentible of
them, and yer through Careleincts or Folly make fuch gross Blun-
ders, are unpardonable. Arcids! be then advifed in Thingsye do not
rightly underlland, that ve may be fentible of every Thing Art can
effect.
Is there anr thing which we cannot imitate with Pencil and Colours;
whether Hear, Cold, Dav or Night, Earch, Air, Water, Fire, Wind,
Thunder, frightful Apparitions, tweer Sounds of Voice or Inflruments,
Sorrow, Jor, Brternels, Sournels, Cc. Even, invifible Things, as
the Sound of an Horn or Trumper? C.
But, let us now fee how thefe Things can be exhibited : Are there
not abundance of Motions, Polures and Paffions, which herein afford
us Help, and which Narure herfelf and daily Inttances thew us, if we
will but take norice of them? What then can be wanting to make our
Meaning plain and clear to every Body : Does not an unexpected Sound
caufe a ludden Emorion? A Thunder-clap, Confternation!  fright
ful Spectre, Terror and Trembling : A Burn, Rage, and a Contrac-
tion of the Members? Sournets, pinching the Mouth and cloting
the Eres; Bitterneis, a loathing Contraction of the Features! Sweet-
nefs, a placid Countenance?
As for the Reprefentation of por Countries, we know, that both
Men and Bealts feek there Shades and Caves for Shelter and Re
pote; allo, that tis niual to wear Umbrellos, and go either naked
or dreft in thin Silks: in celd Countries we find the contrary; for
there, People repofe and recreate in the Sun, or where he gires
the molt Warmih; they fir in an Hut or Houfe by Woodhres;
and if the Country be near the North-pole, they are cloathed in
ool and the Skins of Bears, and other wild Animals. Thus we
fee, one Sort of People feeks Warmth; the other, Coolness. Here,
the Sun thines hot; there, the Snow abounds. The hot Indian ap-
pears almod naked; and the Lyglander and Rufffan hug in party-
coloured Furs. But as thefe Effects are owing to the Sun only, whole
Infiuence on thefe Countries is in Proportion to his Nearnels to or
Distance from them; fo we know, that the Heat or Coldnels of
each

each Climate is thereby cauted, and the Sun feels hotter in one Place
than another.
Since we are treating of the Sun, we shall allo thew how the Poetic
Expreftions, defcribing him, are to be underfood.
Poisy and Painting, being Siffers, agree intirely; and tho' Fables and
Filtions be not thought necellary for a Painter, yet they are delight-
ing and uleful, and we cannot be good Painters without fome Aid from
Poily. We may make ule of Poetic Thoughts, as far as the Hillo-
ry, whether facred or profane, will admit, and as the Nature of a
Thing can be thereby exprefied. How can the Morning, Noon, Even-
ing and Night be more elegantly reprefented, than Homer does it in
some Palfages of his Works; among othe s, at the End of his Odiffee,
where he lays, — All Objects appear in the Morning, at the Down
of Aurera, dark; and afterwards the imperceptible growing Light dif-
tinguishes and gives them their natural Colours.— Thus he, as to the
Beginning of Day; and elfewhere of the Morning and Evening he has
it, — As when Phebus fatigued, hides in Theriss Lap, &cc. He
lays further, — Aurora, the Day-break, and Fore-runner of Phebus,
rose in the Eaft in ber Turn, fitting in a Purple Charicr, and gilded the
Tops of the Mountains, &cc. And Firgil in one Paffage lays,
Aurora, risen out of Tithon’s Safronbed, exc. And in another, 
The Sea was now got refy with Morning-rays: The Orange Day-break
appeared, in the high Heaven, upon the Refe-colour Charict, &cc. Again.
As soon as the Day-break, riding up Heaven, began to be rosy, &cc. All
which Expreffions give us to underlland, that Aurorg's Light begins
with Rednels, and grows gradually Vellow and flronger as the gives
Way to Phabus.
We need not fay more of the Names which the Poets affign this
great heavenly Luminary; Narure fhews us the same daily in almoft all
thofe Qualities; and he who does not confider Nature will reap little
Advantage from my Obfervations.

CHAP. XIV. Of the Narure of the Sun, with respett to different
Countries.
TOR MERL V ar lefure Hours, I diverted myfelf with read
ing the Dekriptions of feveral Eattern and Northern Countries,
written by Lin crot, Olius Alagnas, Archbishop of Opfict, and
others; and, on one Side, I law the Cape of good Hope, where the
Suns great Heat is remper’d by the Sea-breezes, as tis thro' all Iukis,
Tucis, China and other Rezons. Of Ching, Writers fay that it en
jors the fwceref hir, and the Inhabicancs arrive at great Ages, and no
contagous Ditemper is heard of amongit them. I read allo of many
14.
coitly and n. anze Rarirnes, and of the Corostree vielding a refrething
Liquor; and what elfe was worth obferving. On the other Side of
the World I viewed Grentn1, which I found to be exceffive cold, and
full of high Mountains covered with erernal Snow; the Seas abound.
ing with Whales, and the Air piercing and rigorous on the comforta-
ble Suns Deparcure; and, like the Country, the People rough and fa-
vage, as we fee in the Gorks, Fin and Laplamlers, and other bordering
Nations, where cold Air and Narure have great Influence on the
People.

Digetting thefs Things, I had a fancy to make two Sketches of
them: in one, I repreieaced, according to the Writers, Pulm and Cr
coutrees, licde Water but many Hills; and for the Embellifhment,
fome naked Blarts; the Light, a Sun thine: in the other, I could er-
hibir lirtle elle than Fircrees, Wooden Huts and Drifts of Iee; the
People I had cloathed in Bealts Skins, and some hunting wild Bears,
others buty in dragging a Uhale on the fee, which they had killed

Theie Scraiches were lying on my Table, for further Improfe

making me a Vific, caft his Eyes on them, and, tho' but flightly
Fratche, bought them of me; and, at the fame Time, befpoke ano
ther Piece, the Subject whereof I should have from his Son, then new
ly arrived from Indid.
Accordingly the son defcribed to me, a certain Place in India (where
he had lived) generally inhabited by Blacks, except the Governow

himfelf, and some others: He instructed me in feveral Particulars, as well
Manners as Dress and other Things, proper to the Country: All which,
I fet down, and then made a rough Sketch of it with a Pen, in his
Prefence; in which, he faid, I had rightly taken his Meaning. This
being done, I fell to colouring it, in hopes thereby to get his future
Favour; which 1 did. The young Gentleman's Affairs, in the mean
Time, calling him out of Town for three Weeks, his Father, on his
Return, had a Meeting of some Friends, and on that Occafion fent for
the Picture (which was finithed) and, at the fame Time, defired my
Company. The Piece was inflantly hung up; and, after the Gentle-
man had a little viewed it, he took me by the Hand, and whifpered
- Tis very well done; but I forget to tell you one
these Words,
Thing of great Moment; yet you can alter it in half an Hour's Time.
To be short; I had taken the Sun too lew, and alto made him fall into
the Piece pilcreys; which occationed long Ground sades; whereas, I
should have made him vertical (or over Head) as he mott Times ap-
pears in that Country. I was confounded, and owned my Fault; for
his Criticitm was jult, fince the great Heat muft be expret by the Sun's
vertical Peption. Here 1 faw, that, after all my Pains, I had failed
in the main Point, for the Reafon aforefaid. The Gentleman's Judg-
ment was as right in one Point as wrong in the other; for he muft
needs be acquainted with the Nature of the Climate; but his faying,

sw calily the Fault might be rectified, reminded me of the Cale of
Apelles, and I thought, — Ne Suter uttra Crepidus; becaute he
thereby difcovered his Ignorance; for rubbing out the Ground-thades
would not in the leall have better’d it; and to enlighten the Figures
from on high, would be more Work than to begin a new Picture.
Neverthelels, he taught me to make my Advantage of it in Time to
Come.

CHAP. XV. Of the Suns Light upon Objects at Rising and
Setting.
T is unaccountable in many Artifts, who handie an Art, whole The
ory is built on Mathematies; its Practice, on Experience; and the
Execution, on ature; that they take to litle Notice of the

any Obiett anter the Paraliels; namelv, not in the leaft from underneath,
aere the Object, if I may fay fo, as high as the Clouds; and yet we
fee manr Paintings, wherein the Objects are, by a Sun-fer, more lighted
from unternenb ton 13ocs: Which is contrary to Nature; as we may
dailr experience, in walking againt the Sun, how troublefome it is
to thate the Eves He rum our Heads lideways, or hold an Hand
Ferchief before our Eves; even, the Hat is no Defence; and yet the
Sun never takes it unEernen:s.
This may be plainly evilenced by Perspertive; to wit, that, as
the Honzon limts our eight, and the Sun cannot, with respect to the
Exe, delrend lower; therefore he cannot find his Rays upwards, but a
long the GrCkEL, or faral:l.

Thefe Rars isen, in their Pallage, unless you pull your Hat over
27
your Eves, mut needs ihine into them: I even dare to lay, that, were
the Brim of your Hat ren Acres broad, and parallel with the Hori-
2on, it ould not call a Shade of a Pins Breadth over your Eyes,
nor the sun to much as take the under Parts of the Brim, tho' we
were flanding on an Eminence.
Bur, to be the better underftood, let us confider Plate XL.ll. where,
on the Fore-ground, I place a Figure with a Board on its Head (like
the Americans, lerel with the Eye-brows. Next, we fee an high
Building, with a projecting Cornice running towards the Point of Sight;
and, on the other side, an high Column with a Figure on it, having
fuch a Board on its Head as the other. Now you may perceive, that
the Sun does not prite underneath againtt it, but fends his Rays parat
fet, I mean, when he is fetring. Draw then a Ray from the Sun pa-
rallel with the Board of the Fore-igure, and fee how much Shade its
Eves will have. Ferch another Ray from the Front or Cornice to
the Suns Center, to find how much Shade the Projecture will throw on
the Frize; do the same by the Figure on the Column: Then you will
perceive, that the Joints of the Scones in the Building will be parallel
with the Suns Rays, and that the Offcorner of it, tho' lower than
the Nearone, will yer be alike with the Nearone, and the Frize pa-
rallel with the Ground.
Ifit be objected, that, when we he out at Window, the Sun is
lower than the Window-board we lean on, and does not fhine on it: I
antwer, that we only imagine so; for if we rightly obferve, we shall
perceive a small Groundshade of the Crosspiece of the Window, tho'
ever to faint; wherefore we are enabled to conclude, that as long as
the Sun Chines, nay, if but a Finger's Breadth above the Horizon, the

Ground muft receive some Light; and, of contequence, as long as the
Ground is somewhat lighted, it is impoffible for the Sun to thine on
any thing from underneath. Suppole, for Inflance, a Column, fix
Feet high, lighted by a Sunfet; if this Column throw any vilible
Shade on the Ground, the Ground mult have fome Light; and, if
to, how is it pollible, that the Sun should fhine from above and from
underneath at the same Timel And if it be granted, that the Sun does
not light the Column on Top, irs Ground-hade muft needs be infinite;
in which Cafe, the Capital ought juft to be lighted from underneath,
and the Ground, of Neceffity, to be without Light. This is an un-
deniable Truth, though the Point be little handled by Writers; even,
feldom heeded by Mafters: Tis allo no Wonder to fee some fail in
it; the moft probable Reafon for which (as I think) is their Ignerance
in Perspective.
C H AP. XVI. Of the Application of Sun shine and other Lights.
T is an old and rooted Evil, and thereby almoff become a Law,
rather to gratify our Fancies and Paltions, than confult Reafon:
Molt Painters verify this in their Choices and Ufes. To represent
Sun-shine, fay they, is pleafant, and delights the Eye; therefore we
must always introduce it. But this cannot be; fince the Varieties of
the Seafons, and a Change in all Things vifible demonftrace the con-
trary. This Light is indeed very agreeable in a Landskip, but very
differviceable within doers; for, how ridiculous, in a great Encertain-
ment, would Sun-thine appear on the Table? And how could the
Guelts fee one another? Or, how could the Glitter of the Plate be ex-
prefted, without obicuring every thing elfe?
What a fine Piece would that be, where the whice Tablecloth mult
be mixed with black ? And how agreeable would it look to fee the
Ground-thades of the Window-frames and Squares expreited on the
Table and Floor. Sun thine is not always proper; and yet some will
not give themfelves time to think whether the Subject require it or not;
2s, in Chrift's Crucifiaion it is improper, becaute the Scriptures men-
tion the Sun to be hidden.
The better to explain my Meaning, I shall exhibit three different
Lights in as many Ordonnances relating to the Perfon of our Sa-
jiour.

Of CRRIST’s Crucifixion.
Here, on Mount Gelyoths, is the Place of Suftering. The Sun, tho'
a. Voon, is cheared, by a dark Cloud. Behold how the Place is light-
cl, from the right Side, where are the Crots and People, receiving
a fring and a froid Light from the Clouds; all this appears on the
tard Ground. The Figures on the Fore-ground, thadowed by a
Clzd, are not so breadh hgored, but unite gradually in Force with
the others, till they come to be Pite brostgbted. About the third
Ground the Sky is durker, and full of heary Clouds, which, as they
rite, krem to draw a little crots towards the Sun, which is on the
Fight Sdr.
Now, we meft follow Truch as much as poffible, and not our Fancies
or Choices. Here, every thing ought to be ftill and inactive; Chise

Tis hor proper on all Occations, as mar appear in the two following
Ordonnances; one of which is firing did brondly lighted, and the
other with Sta-tire, parp and leng-shaded.
Truly, a Piece with theie Confiderations, and exhibiting the Nsturs
of Trings and Tins, mut needs pleate the Curious: Even, the very
hearing tuch Reaions and Obfervacions can make a Lover knowing;
especialle, if he be isstructed by a good Mafter in right Principles,
and is fomewhat convertant in Drawing. Such an one may even cas-




circe Parters, if he have a particular Genins, quick Apprehention
and a good Alemory; improve his Time, read good Books and fhun
fuch Company as prartle much, and do lirtle.
To converfe with the Skilful and Judicious is very commendable,
but the contrary, injurious. Reafon should always take place, and a
ditcerning Jedgment not be rejected.
Rather de sometbing less, and

wign it terougths. Augaiars saying is, on this Occation, not amiss,
Fering lente; Hgre with Rase. Good Things will endure, but thofe
which are to feemingly, mull decay. Burmy Zeal has carried me too
far, and therefore I shall return to my Purpofe in the Ordonnance.

rial. The Funeral Rites are performed within, and one of two Lamps
are seen fomewhat to light the Hollow. The Body is carried in by 3
or 4 Men. The Time is about the Evening, and the Sundoes not thinc.
Behold the People, againft the Rock, almost witbout Groundbades, as
being lighted from on high, and a little forward; becaute of another
Piece of a Rock rifing up there by the Side, alike with the former.
Obterve the three Figures, on the fecond Ground, flanding between the
two Rocks; thofe, wanting the Fore-light, mull needs receive it from
behind. Somewhar further, on the third Ground (which is the com-
mon Road) some People are coming clofe by the Trees flanding on
the right side of the Piece, who, on the other Side beyond the large
Rock receive their Light from the left Side; a plan Proof, that,
were they more diftant in the Field, they would be lighted from all
Sides.
My principal Remark on the Piece is this. This Burying place be
longs to Toseph of Arimathes, and lies near the City of Tcrufalem, as the
Text thews. He is there with his People, who carry in the Corps.
Now, my Intention is, to light this foremoll Croup as prongly as pof-
lible, and yet without Sunspine: The Light comes almot frenting, by.
reafon of the Side-rocks, which obstrult a Side-light; to that they can
fcarce have any Shade other than from bebind through the Rock or
Burying-place, a little from some Cypreffes slanding on one Side of it.
Between the two Rocks, 1 shew, that the People, coming forward,
mult needs be lighted from bebind, fince they are Hill half in the
open Air; and that thofe fomewhat further off, in the Road, againtt
the Side trees, ought to be lighted forwards, backwards, and from the
loft Side, where the Rock is very low; confequently have but little
Shade on the right Side of the Trees, againtt which, their Ground
Rhades fall. The other Croup and the Stone heaps in the Field, on 2
lower Ground, I thew to be lighted from all Sites, and to have no
other Shade than from below, and the decpelt Hollows; becaute the
Sky is fercled, and without Clouds. Row, irscertain, that few will
relith to nice an Obtervation, fince they follow their own Fancies witt-
out further inquiry: Vet if any of the Circumftances were omitted, the
Matter would allo be lels apparent.
The chief Regards had here are to the Light; the Tine or Heur;
the Situation of the Eurying-place; and the Quality of the Man who per-
formed the Funeral Rites, not only as to his Perion and Authoriry, but
alfo with respect to his Dress; together with the Alanner of the So-
temnity, according to Scripture: All which appear plainly. As for itr

about Terufslem (of which the aforefaid is one) we fee them fmall
and mean, large and ftacely, according to the Condicions of thofe who
cauted them to be made; as the Scripture teltifies.
Let us now obferve the third Ordonnance.
Of CRRISTs Rejurrection.
I again reprefent here a Rock; before the Entrance whereof is fir-
ting the roung Man or Angel, on the Stone of the Sepulchre, in shin.
ing Rarment, (peaking to the three Women, and pointing upwards.
Cbr;: ariiing is furrounded with Rays like thofe of the sun; where-
by, two of the Homen (one beholding him with her Hand over her
Eyes) are to crongly and Burply lightes, that their Shades, by reaton
of the Nearnets of the Dazzle, fall very diftinl on the Ground for-
wards, and on every thing elle thereabouts. One of thefe Women,
as neareft the young Man, thereby receives prong Reffexions; when
the third (who is ftepping towards the Sepulchre) is without the Reach
of either Light, and tho' receiving, in a manner, some Light from the
Air, yer melts in the brord Shades. Somewhat further, on the second
Ground, the Trees allo, along the Way, give broad Sbades. In the
Offskip is feen 7crufalem in a rifing Mill; becaute is Day-break; the
Heavens abounding with trim Clouls mottly in the Sun's Quarter,
which on the right side of the Piece appears a little on the Horizon,
fomewhat vellowith and purple.
Now, if a Lover or Matter will, with due Reffexion, join hs
Thoughts with mine, and not fear any Trouble in the Performance,
I quettion not but he will, by fuch a Reprefentation, fatisty Coartifls,

having, in the preceeding Chapters, fufficiently thewed their
Nacures, Effects and Qualities; yet, to finith this Head, we
shall here lubjoin some Particulars which could not before have Place.

Chap. 17.

As for the Sun, my Opinion is, that he cannot be represented in any
Picture; Firft, becaute the Eye is too weak to behold him; and there-
fore his Force cannot be expreffed otherwife than by making all Objects
dark and black. Secondly, becaute when he thines directly in our
Faces, we cannot perceive the right Shapeor colour of Things, unlets
we shade the Eyes, as Nature teaches.
For the fame Reafon, I think, we may not reprefent a burning Can-
dle, Torch or other Matter giving a great Light, unlets we allo ex-
hibit the Objects as this Light makes them appear to us, and not as by
their Colour, Stir and UUnion they really are; for the further from
the Candle, the more faint they become. Tis therefore Folly to
raintain, that the natural Force of Candle light, especially it the
Flame be feen, can be imitated, fince it is paff our Skill to give the
other Work its due Appearance; for when the Light of the Candle
thines in our Faces, the mot deep and dark Colours, even Black it.
felf, appear neither darker nor blacker than they would in a dark Dav.
But we shall afterwards treat more largely of thefe Lights; and there-
fore now proceed to lay
That thofe who love to paint Sunshine may obferve, that tis pro
per for Sacrifices, Combars, Bacchanals, Dancings, Sports of Herdf-
men and fundry other jovial Occurrences and Hiffories, which require great
Buffle; but very improper and oblirulting in Councils, Pleadings, En
tertainments, Acadenies, Wedding-ceremonies and other such Circumstances.
But Cloadlight gives an uncommon Decorum and Nacuralness in solemn
Afairs; such as, Affemblies of Magiftrates, Pleadings and other Buss
ness of Authority and Consequence.
The third of the Lights, of which we have fpoken (the Terch or
Candle) is proper for mournful Occasons, for dying Persons, Burials and
such like; elpecially in the open Air.
The Sun appears agreeable and delightful in the open Field, when,
thro' thick Buthes and Trees, his Rays here and there light the
Grounds, and the People are feen repoling or diverting in the Shade:
Bur he acts againtt Nature, who exhibits tender and beautiful Virgins
basking in a funthing Field, faring at the Sun, and talking and be-
holding each other with as little Concern as if it were but a Candle
or Star-light; fince he himfelf would leave their Company, and retire
t0 Shade.
To prevent any Miftakes of which Kind, let us defcribe the chief
Fimes of the Day.

Day-break.
This firft born Time of the Day favours the Enterprizes of great
Generals in befrging or ferming a Town; no Time more proper for it,
by the the Example of Joshns in taking of Fericho. This Rule, tho'
not without Exception, has been obferved by all Nacions; of which
I could give many Inftances. The Batule of Pemper againtt Cafar be-

gan at that Time.
Tis allo the proper Time for Hunting; as in
the Reprefentation of a Diana, Cephalus, Adonis or any fuch Subject.
Jndicious Mafters alwars chule the Hour of the Day which beft agrees
with their Story. This Time is of fingular Advantage for the haff
Tints it gives; exhibiting all Things in their natural Corours; whence
arife an uncommon Agreeablenets and Decorum.
The Morning.
This Time principally rejoices Nisture; even inanimate Things are
fentible of it. The glittering Light takes the Tops of high Mountains,
and cautes, both in Buildings and Landskip, great Shades, appearing
very delightful. This Light, at breaking out, gives uncommon Sweer-
nets when the Objects shine in the Water; as allo a certain Freshness
mixel with Vapours, which bind the Parts of Things fo well together,
2s intirely to pleafe the Eye of the Knowing.
At this Time the Herthens offered their Sacrifices: And we read,
in the Books of Mofes, that the Children of Irael had not only cheir
forning-oblations, but allo worthipped the golden Calf at that Time.
The Tows recain thole Cultoms to this Day; as alfo did the ancient
Chrifians, who offen baptized in the Mforning; as was likewife Chrif
in Fordin. The Persuns moreover honoured the Morning by their
Oferings. Wherefore we ought to have due Regard to the Time of
76e Day on all fuch Occafions; and take especial Care, that the
Light fall on the principal Object and Place, according to Poufins Con
duct in a Picture of Cbrif refering the Blind to Sight; wherein the
greatell and flrongel Light is intirely (pread over our Saviour.
The Light between Morning and Noon.
This Light is not very fir for Objects, if it be not broken by fome
Accident of Rain, Sterm or Tempel. Such a Time may be prope
for

for mournfal Ocsasons; fuch as, the lall Judgment and our Saviours
Suffering, when (as faid in the laft Chapter) the Sun was darkened;
which looks frightful, and caules an expreffible Amazement: Where-
fore fine and pleafant Weather would, on fuch Occalions, look ri-
diculous.
Noon.
At this Time the Sun, darcing his glittering Rays, thines in full
Splendor; wherefore I defire thofe, who ufe this Seafon, to think,
that Nature effelts, by the Force of this Light, what cannot be repre-
sented; fince we often fail in our utmoft Actempes for that Purpofe:
Whereby it happens, that in endeavouring to make Things come for-
ward, we often ule fuch a Force of Light, on the Fore-ground, as far
exceeds that of the Sun; as in the Cale of Draperies of a fiery Colour,
or the like. Certainly an unaccountable Way of proceeding.
Neverthelels, the Suns Light may be bidden behind Mountains,
Buildings, &cc.
This Hour gives Ret to human Labour. The Scriptures tell us,
that Chriff, tired with his Journey, fat to reft on the Well; which
gave the Woman of Samarra occation to hear his wonderful Predilti-
on; His Difciples, alfo wearied, lad down near him. He who en-
deavours truly to reprefent the Natures of Things, mull especially ob-
ferve the Times and Hours proper to them.
The Afternoon.
As this Seafon is moft liable to Diverfity of Weather, by means of
driving Clouds, which occafion many Over-calls, tis very proper in
the Reprefentation of Bacchanals and licentious Aftions. But thele are
not always fixed to that Time.
The Evening.
Labourcealing at this Time, it gives Liberty for all Sorts of Paf
time; as Dancing, Walking, &xc. If you would reprefent the march-
ing home of an Army, or Herdfmen driving their Cattle out of the Field,
this Time is the moft proper for them. This Light frequently changes
its Colour by the Interpofition of riting Vapours, which it draws; but
does notwithflanding moft times enlarge the Superficies of Objects.

When the Shades do not receive the Reffexions of other Objects, they
ouger to parrate of the Light. This Seafon is quite different from the
Morning; vet not less agreeable, by its small glittering Lights, if we
keep the general Light fomcubat dasky, which creates great Mases

to both ancient and modern Practice: Nevertheless, I shall not

fee her like the Sun alears retain ber natural Bigness: And if this be


granted, the concrary muit be unnatural, and therefore forbidden to a
Paiter, who is the Imirater of true Nuture.
Had 1 a mind to paint a Moon skine, I would, without Injury to
Nature, manage it, as I have before faid, I would reprefent the Sun;
that is, to exhibit her Shine, but not her Body (for the Light is of great
or Moment is a Picture than the Bodies of either the Sun, Moon or 2
Candle) lighting my Objects thereby either from behind, fideways or
forwards (and as well in Figures as Landskip) somewhat darker than the
Duylght, that it may appear a true Moen-light, and not a Sun-thine (which
it very much affects by its fudden Lights and tharp Ground-shades) making
the Blue Sky here and there, with some glittering Stars. And, to make ir
fill look more natural, we may, if the Subject permit, introduce up and
down Torches or other Lights, burning Piles of Wood, Offerings or
other Fires, as Occafion requires, and thereby mate the Lights the
sirenger, and the Colouring ruffet and more jellow; yet the Shades not to

be so harp as those of the Meon. This would, in my Opinion, have a
fine Effect, especially if the faid accidental Lights were moftly ordered
in dark Places. But we ought principally to obferve, that in the whole
there muft be feen more Darkness than Light, and that no Colours ap-
pear to beautiful as thofe of the Sky, in reference to the Moon, unless
they be red, yellow, and fuch others as are peculiar to burning Lights
(as we have thewed in the firtt Chapter of the fourth Book) for Light
red and yellow become dark: The Moon’s Brightness, contrarily, makes
dark Blue and Sea-green appear lighter; but Black Keeps its Poft;
wherefore little light Red, and as little dark Blue ought to be feen in
the Picture.
By fuch a Difpofition, we gain two Advantages; 1. A natural Light.
2. An uncommon Variery in the Colours.
If any one find any Difficulty herein, he may pleafe to know, that
he is no more obliged to exhibit the Moon than the Sun in his Piece;
becaute the former takes it's Courfe round the Heavens as well as the
latter, and may therefore be placed as the Elegance of the Figures and
By-works require, fince both illuminace the Earth and its Objects
forwards, backwards and fidewife.
As to Quality, in three Particulars the Moon is to like the Sun,
that there is no Difference between them: As, 1. She always throws
her Rays parallel as well as he. 2. All that is lighted by her is broad
and tharp. 3. The Shades on the Ground are plain, and conform with
the Objects: But the Reffexions are not to Hrong as in Sun-thine; be-
caule the Moon light is weaker than the Suns, by reafon of the oppofite
Natures of thofe two Luminaries, the one being warm, and the other
cold; And as the Moon receives her Light from the Sun, the canthere-
fore not have to much Power to impart it to the Earth; nor the Objects,
lighted by her, appear to diffind to the Eyc. Again, as the Sun often
alters his Colour by means of the Vapours which he exhales; to we lind
the fame in the Moon, who, by the fame Means becomes alfomore
pale or yellow in Proportion to the Vapours about her, or the Airs
Rarity or Denlity.
Can it be doubted, wrether fuch a Piece of Moon-light, without
the Appearance of her Body, be fuch, when the Darknels, Broadness,
and Sharpnets of the Ground-hades, and the Palencts of the Colour
are well obferved, all which conjunctively express Evening or Night.
If it be a Quchion, whether this were the former Practice? 1 lay, 1
have no Buliness to enquire into that; fince we ought not to accommo-
date the Art to Fancy, but our Senfes to the Arc. Tis to as linle

Purpofe to confider, what is done; but rather, what may or ought
to be cose, according to the Dillates of right Reafon. In short, tisim-
poffible, when the threeaforefaid Qualities are well observed in a Piece,
It hould fail of reprefenting a very natural Moon light.
As my Polition runs counter to old Cuftom, and therefore not to
caly to Apprehenion, I have endeavoured to explain myfelf by the
three Examples in Plate Xllil.
in the firtt, I fhew the Moon in her natural Bignels, yet without the
Piece; becaute the would otherwife come too near the Horizon, and
caule too long and difagreeable Ground-hades.
in the lecond, the is exhibited after the old ltay. And,
In the third, I thew only a Starry Sky, with the frong Lights of a.
Moon, who, as in the firtt Example, is without the Picture.
if any one think, that the Moon's Body gives a firong Glitter,
Elegance and Life to a Piece; 1 fay, the sparkting Light of the Stars
does the same; effecially if we make them, as large as they appear to
us; but not in a Perifeltive way, as being berween Heaven and Earth,
like the Moon. However, we need not reprefent them all, but the
chief only ; fuch as, the Charict, the Triangle, the Serpent, the Norts
and Evening Star, and tuch as make a known Figure; all which, as
having no figural Being, but only the Shine of a very fmall Light,
may be eafily expreffed by fmall Points.
We may allo make the Moon, though without the Piece, appear in
the Water, and caute an agreeable Reffexion in the waving surges;
and, by chuling fuch a Side-fight, we have the Advantage of reprefent-
ing alf teings q7 berutifal, neither more nor lets than in Sun-thine or
common Light.
I mull fubjoin another important Confideration; which is, that as
the Moon's Light is fomerimes obllrutted by high Objects, fuch as
Rocks, Palaces, Trees, Hills, Coc. to some Parts mut needs be dark;
in which, the Reffexions of to weak a Light haveno Power to enlight
en or feigh our the Objects or Bodies in them, though ever to near.
For this Reafon, a Painter ought to avoid juch Accidents, and not to
incroduce them unlets through Neceffity, to create an Harmony or Forbe;
and to place them mathr forward, or in the Offskip, againft the Sky;
for fetting them between bork, cannor but make a dijagreeable Spot, un
leis it be broke by fome Water, wherein the Reflexion of some Stars
orother Lights of the Air appear; and, into fuch a Choice of Land
ship or Vitto, you may introduce, white Marble images, Buildings
light By-works, and light coloured Stufts, which all together loon

agreeable: And as the Night vapours are more deafe than thofe of
the Day, to the diftant Objects become more faddenly dark and undiffin-
puispable. Forger not, that in windy Weather, the Moon as well as
the North-Star, is encompafted with a yellow Ring.
If any Perfon be not yet fully fatisfed, let him pleafe to weigh the
following palpable Realons: Tbe Sun, Moon and Stars cannot diminish;
becaute we can neither approach nearer nor go further from them; but
all fublunary Objects can, by our Recels or Approach leffen or magnity:
And, to prove this, take a Glass of the Size you intend your Picture;
place it before a Window, and draw on it the Prospect, with the
Moon, as it then appears to the Eye; which done, you will fee how
large the ought to be painted. Now, if you approach with this Glats
some thouland Steps nigher towards the Sun or Moon, they will not
appear bigger on or through the Glass, but have the same Magnitude:
Whence arifes the Falficy of those Reprefentations, which diminish the
Sun, Moon or other Meteors as well as the Figures.
I conclude then, that the Pictures, exhibiting Nature contrary to
what the ought to be, are liable to Cenfure, and that we ought to feek
Truth by Ratiocination, and then, waving old Cultoms and Prejudice,
to believe our own Eyes.
I hall further illultrate this Matter, in the Chapters shawing, What
is meant by a Table; and of the Uses of magnifying and diminishing
Claffes; and of the Difference between large and small, warm and weak
painting; to which we refer the curious Artift.

beautiful; having two Qualiries, to wit, of afrighting and rejoicing.
1rs Light is very proper for Bacchanals, Entertarnments, Plays and o-
ther jofal Mertings; and, on the comrary, frightful in Serceries, Ap.
Pirisions of Grors, and tuch like nocturnal and unexpected Accidents.
The Lamp is melancholy, faint and gloomy, and therefore proper for
Barials, Prisons, near fick and dying Persons, and on other mournful
Occations. This Light is moft agreeable within-doors, and in Gaves,
Grettes, or frightful and unfrequented Places of small Extent.
The Astare of this Light, and irs Efef on Colours, are the fame
as thote of the Sun, with respelt to irs falfifying the Colours; but the
Light and Reffexion are not to frong; for which Reafon, the Arrift is
often at a fland in the Ules of them, arifing moftly from his flight-
ing this Light as a Matter not worth his Obfervation.
in reference to Shades, they are not much unlike thofe of the Sun,
25 well in Brondness as Sharpness; yet with this Difference, that the
Sunlight falls more uniform on Objects, as he is more diftant from
them; and becaute in the Evening, but especially at Night, the Vi-
pours are darker and more deate than thofe of the Day: Whence it
follows, that all Objects, deprived of the Lamplight, ditappear;
and, by reafon of it's Nearnels, can be lighted but in part.
To contirm this, we thall exhibit a Marhematical Inftance in Plate
XLII.
Fx a Point A for the Center of the Light, from which all the
Rars ffow. Draw, under it, a Candleftick of a certain Height, as4
Feer above the Ground. Then skerch z or 4 Columns going off fur
ther and further from the faid Point of Light: Ler thefe be 3 Feet
high. Next, fet one Foot of the Compaffes on the faid Point, and
extending the other, to as to touch the Extremity of the firft Pillar,
tweep a segment of a Circle on the Shaft; do the same with the other
Pillars. Now, you will perceive that the firlt Pillar is leaft toucbed,
bur receives the fronge? Light, and that, above and beneath the Touch,
the Light falls weaker and weaker: Moreover, that the furcheff Co
lumn is mof toucked, by means of the greater Sweep of the Compaffes,
and therefore it will be lighted almol all over, but allo moft weak.
IThence Tis plain, that Objects lighted by fuch Lights, are never light
I intirely and uniform. nd were they rouched and lighted alike, it
would be to faint and dark, that we should perceive nothing diffindly,
either in Colour or Our line, more than in a weak Moon-thine.

if any one want further information how 1 apply this to Practice,
I shall now freely impart it.
Firfl, I skeich my Ordonnance on blue or dark Drawing-paper;
then 1 make my Plan, to thew the Places of the Figures and other
Objects; which 1 flightly feratch; next, 1 affign a Point for my Light,
either high or low as Occation requires; on this Point I fet one Foot of
the Compaffes, and with the other, touch Circle-wife (with an Extent
equal to each Objects Diftance from the faid Point) all the Objects
wherever it happens: By this means I find the Parts, which, as near-
ef the Light, ought to have the prongeff Light; and confequently the
Diminution of the Light and Colour thews itfelf in Proportion as it
goes of from the drawn Circles.
As for the Reffexions, they are in the fame Cafe with all Lights;
the brighteff, largeft and Rrongeft give the frongelt; and the purer the
Light, the more yellow appear the Colours both in the Lights and Re-
fexions: Contrarily, the fouler and more vaperous the Light, the more
Russet seem the Colours.
(A Candle is yellowith.
The Light of . A Lamp is Ruffet.
A Flambeau, or Torch, is more Red.
Artifis, who delight in reprefenting fuch Lights, ought to regard
the three following ufeful Precepts.
1. To keep molt Light together.
2. To take especial Care in the meling and lighting of their Out-
lines.
3. To obferve the Naturalness of the feveral Lights, whether Can-
dle, Lamp or Torch.
It muft allo be noted, that the Space between the Eye and the
Light, as likewife the firft Object or Figure (if it come before the
Light) ought to be the durkeft; but if it be behind the Light, it be-
comes weaker and weaker both in Light and Shale, occationed by the
Vapours, which, as before has been laid, appearing more denfe in the
Evening, the Night light more affects them and enlightens them.
Add to this, that the Mainlight being temper’d with light Vel-
low, Ruffet or Red, the Diminution and Breaking of thofe Colours
ought to be found by Black; I mean, by Black and the proper Colours
wherewith the Objects are shaded, and more or less weak in Proporti-
on to their Diftance; for the foremoff Darkness, and neareft to the
Light is more warm than the hinder and furthermofl, which, in Pro-
portion to its Diftance, becomes more blue; yet, much more in the o.

gen Sir than withindeers; becaute the Vapours of the Air are more
iubtile than thofe of conined Lights, which being made with Lamp-
oil, Rofin, or the like, emit a foul Smoke.
But as the foremoll Objects mult, by means of a confined Light with-
i2-drsrs, reeds be fubjert to much Shade, whereby they often main
tain but a small Light on their Extremities, it will be found, that
luch eutaarl Lights appear more or lois frong than the Objects lighted
freght forwards, according as the Stuff whereon it falls is either rough
or (mogtr. As for the Reffexions, with the Light thining thro' thin
Folds, I obferre the fame Management as 1 prefcribe for Sunfhine

by keep cleaner, and are lets fouled; and Hill lets in the open Air,
than with:z doors.
I am even not afraid to add an eafy Method for finding the Diminu-
fir: of ti Linis on Object:, according to their Diftances, not from the

Pon of Sgar, but from the Candle, Torch or Lamp. Cut a Strip of
Paper or 1 cilum, as long as from the Center of the Light to the fur
thet Corner of the Piece. Ler it be a Finger and half broad at Bot
rom, and c: awar to a Point at Top. Then paint the Point with
fuch Colour as vou give your Light, yellowith or ruffet, diminithing
it gradually in Proportion to its going off from the Light. Next,
with a Pin, fix the faid Point in the Center of the Light, to as to more
it about, at pleasure, to all the Objects near to or diftant from the
Light. Then divide this Strip into degrading Fict, small at the
pointed light End, and from thence gradually larger; by which means
the Scrip will ther, withour Trouble, the right Tint to temper.
For the Objects going into the Picture towards the Point of
Sight, you may make another Strip, the Reverfe of the former, to
WII, Light at the Bortom, and diminithing towards the Top or Point,
to be fixed on the Point of Sight.
I you would ule any more Helps for the Diminution of the Co
Jours, and lets troublefome, try the following Method.

Haring, in my Ordonnance, exactly defigned the Figures after the
Life, I paint it like a Common light Piece, without breaking the Co
lours more than Perspective requires. The Light 1 take as from a
Candle or other Mlatter, proceeding from a Point within the Piece,
whether within doors or in the open Air. After which, I take a thin
glazing Vellow of the fame Tint I give to my Light, and Scumble

it nealy and thin over both Lights and Shades. This Vellow muft
not be too dark, becaute my main Heightning is taken only from a
common Light; wherefore Asphalium, yellow Lake, and Dragons
Blood would be to warm and fentible, as to take away the Mipiness in-
separable from Nighhpieces, unlets it were before painted accordingly;
to the no small Trouble of the rtiff. Now, as glared Things com-
monly abate of their Neatnels, you may, if it be neceffary, retouch
the Main-lights, as well in the Faces as other Parts, and thereby ferch
out their Force again.
The Advantage arifing from this Method is, that there is no Kind
of Night light, whether of Lamp or other Oil, Pirch, Brimftone,
Candle or Torch, but it may be reprefented with the fame Trouble;
becaute it depends only on the tempering the glazing Colour; the bett of
which, in my Opinion, is Cumbooge, light Pink or yellow Lake mixt
with a little Vermillion.
I think thefe very good Methods; becaute fomerimes in Night
pieces, elpecially in great Brytles, we use two, three, and more particular
burning Matters for Lights and by this means we obtain a fure Nicthod
for fetching out thofe Lights and Fires, not only ar Night, but allo in:
the Day-time, in the Evening, nay, in Sunskine, where we often meet
with Flambeaus, Torches, burning Allars or Piles of Wood.
But let me not propofe thefe Precepts as Laws, but Examples to
exercife the Artifts Curiofity, and for their Proficiency; wherein I
with my Lahours may be of Service.
CHAP. XX. Necefary Hints in the Use of Perfpective.
H A VE been long confidering a Point, which, in my Opinion,
is very remarkable, and yet has never been fertled; tho' I think ic
may be done: It relates to the Execution of Hiffories, either with-
in or without-deers, and Landskip embellised with Figares.
My Thoughts are, that as Perspective affigns a certain Diftance for
viewing a Pilture with respect to its Magnitude or Smallnets; or, a
large Piece with large Figures, and other Objects going off, to wit, on
the second and third Grounds, thofe Objects ought to be as nearly. fi-
nithed as thofe on the Fore-ground; provided they keep their Faintness,
cauled by the interpoting AAir. This Pofftion, I think, is founded on.
certain and natural Principles.

Bar I mult prerioully fuppofe, that when we fay, a Piece is well s.
iked, it mut be underffood that the Whele is fo, and not a Part on.
1y. If we begn inquiries, we ought to puth them as far as polhible,
to enable us to lay; tuch a Piece is artfully executed; nay, to perfect,
that nothing is wanting: For that cannot be affirmed, when the Fore-
ground is hniched and well painted, and the fecond and third Grounds
but flarely rouched. I grant, that we fomerimes fee Pieces with
imall Figures, tho' loofly handled, accounted finer and more artful
than large Pictures laboured and highly finithed; yet it mult be allow.
ed, that more Work is necelfary in a large finithed Piece than a fmall
o e looly handl d: The very Words (fnishel and feofy) imply it.
Mr Opinion is, that if we be not wanting in Trouble and Time, as
artful a Piece may be produced, as what has been hitherto done, yet
only by thole who underfland Arr and its Rules in Theory and Prac
tice. And tho' ir feem ditficult to aftempt a Thing new, we mult
not therefore be difcouraged; for what great Things have not been ex-
perimented and performed : What did not Afexander? Had he feared
Danger and Trouble, he would never have gone the Lengths he did.
He had a mind to do it; rhis created a Refolution, and that finithed
his Hopes
But, to return to our Subject, let us fuppofe, that a Picture ten Feer
high, with Figures as big as the Life, ought to be viewed at ten Feer
Diulance; and that a lmaller one, five Feet high, with Figures half as
big as the Life, muft have five Feer Diftance; and thus the smaller the
nearer, according to Perspective: Now, the Quellion is, which of thote
three Pieces ought to be moft finithed? Many will certainly fay, 
The 12?. But my Opinion is, that each of the three Pieces mult be
painted equally neat; becaute each has its determinate Diftance with
respect to its Bignets.
Again, there is another fuch Piece, ten Feet high, but divided in
to three Grounds, whereon are placed the fame Figures as in the three
former; to wit, thote as big as the Life on the Fore-ground, thote
half as big, on the second, and the lat on the third Cround; the
Queftion now is, which of thefe three Grounds ought to be moft finith
ed! Being all in one Pilture, the Judges will, contrary to what they
before afferred, fay, The first; and that the hindermoft muft not be to
near and finithed; fince they can never relish, that the Figures on the
second and third Grounds ought to be painted as neat and elaborate a
thote on the Fore-ground; for lay they, — Who would por

But the Cafe is not, whether there have been fuch Pictures; but
whetber they ought to be sof We are not ignorant, that tis the Cultom
to finith fmall Pieces, the fmaller the neater; and large ones, contrari-
ly, bold or loofe; now I would fain know the Reafon why there should
be more Work in a Figure of three Feet than in one of lix! Can it be
proved, that the fmall one ought to have a Fold, nay, an Hair, more
than that in full Proportion: But, what other Anfwer can be made,
— If the Cultom were not good, it would not have prevailed, nor laft-
ed to long? Neverthelels, as long as we reafon thus without Foundation,
and bigor ourfelves to common Practice, and old Cuftom, we shall never
advance. Irs not the proper Way to go forward; and therefore many
keep their old Station. But I want to be informed of now Things;
without which Art cannot improve. Variety nourishes the Mind. I
grant, that Men fometimes produce new Things which meet not with
publick Approbation; but, whence come they ? Either from falfe
Grounds and inconfideration, or elfe an immethodical Way of Expla-
nation.
To express my Thoughts perfpicuoully, I have exhibited them as
plain as I could in Plate XL. V. and queltion not but you will appre-
hend my Meaning.
Numb. 1. Has three Pieces fronting; with their Diftances of 10,
5.
and 3 Feet and an half.
Numb. 2. Is the fame in Profile; with the Meafure or vifual Rays
which limit the Diftances, whether great or fnall; being the same
Polition 25
Numb. s. Where they are all three in one.
Now, my original Quettion, with respect to Numb. 1. is, which of
the three Pieces ought to be moft finithed! If any one fay;  Tbe
small one, because it muft be viewed neare,?. I ask again, whether there
mult bemore Work in the small than the large one? Now behold Numb.
 where they are all three in one according to Perspective; and let
the Queftion be, which ought to be moft finithed, the foremoll or the
hindmoft? Vou will certainly antwer, that it thews itfelf, that the Fi-
gures on the Fore-ground muft be more finithed than what is further
off, and that there muft allo be more Work in the large, as being
Rearer.
But how agrees this with what was juft now faid, that the smalleft of
the three Pieces ought to be moft finithed; fince now you fay, the turg-

gi mull be to; for the Examples and Objects are the fame; and it is al.
ready granted, that the fmallerit is, the nearer is the Distance affigned;
and that in the imalleff or furthermoff, when nearelt, there ought to
be as much Work as in the feremoit: And tho' you will fay, that
the latt Figure is fainter than the foremott; yer there is not a Fold
lets in it than if it were quite forward, and as big as the Life.
Jurge further; when lhighly finith a Figure in full Proportion after
the Lte, I muff fir ar learl as near as the Model is high, to perceive
:eren the morl minuce Parts of 1t. Now if I would make another Fi-
gure half as big, allo after the Life, to place it on my fecond Ground,
How multI then fer the Modet! Ought 1 to keep the same fitting, or

whit cannor be feen in the Life, ought not (to make it look natural)
to come into a Picture; yet, pray obferve, that luppoling I make, in
the Oftship, a Figure of a Foor and half high, and the Subject require
it to be holding a Thread, to which hangs a Medal of the Bignets of
half a Guinea, the Queltion is, whether I mult exprets the Medal,
but not the Thread? Again, were I to reprefent a Window without
the Glazing or Lead work, or a Door, without Hinges or a Key-hole,
what would thole Things be taken for, if thefe did not appear! A
Metal dropping our of the Hand; an open Window; and a Screen in
llead of a Door.
From all which Premifes I infer, that if Things be prafticable, and
hove any Bigness, they ought to be expressed in the Little, and, asl
may lay, even to a Thread The Diftance makes them natural
if well painted, and the Diminution be exactly obferved according to
the Remoreness of the Objects.
Whether thefe Obfervations will pats current I Know not; yet every
Mian has the Libery to ule or ler them alone, as he pleafes.

C H A P. XXI. Of the different Colouring in great and small
Pieces.
7HIS Propofition is a Confequence of the preceding; and, to
be incelligible, I shall thew my Thoughts by the following Ex
ample in Plate KLVi.
There is a Gallery 12 Feet high and 25 Feet long
divided into
three Pannels, each five Feet wide and to Feet high. The two out-
ward Pannels are cloathed from Top to Botcom, and the middle one
but half way from the Top downwards; and under it is an handlome
bear. Thele three Cloths are to be painted by three feveral Malters,
Itarpose with Lindskips, all having a like Horizon, but different
Poince of Sighr. one Mafter embellifhes his Work with Figures, ei=
ther Fable or Hillory: Another introduces Architelture and imagery,
according to his Gullo: And the chird adorns his with Cartle, or what
elle he thinks fit.
The Queltion is now, in order to produce a general Decorum agree-
ing with Nature, whether thefe Mafters ought not to be concurring
in their Work, with respect to Perspective, Force and Diminutions
Certainly they ought; for the Light muft in all the three Pictures fatt
alike, either from the left, right, before or behind; the Air mult be
the fame; fince they all ought to appear as one Landship, feen through
three Openings, as two Doors and a Window.
But now, another Queltion arifes, whether the Figures, in all three.
ought to be as big as the Life? This will beagreed to, with respect to
thofe on the Fore-ground: But how then will it be, in the middle

Pilture, which is but half the Size of the two others! How shall Fi-
gures be incroduced there, in full Proportion? for half a Foot of
Ground, or five Feet, is too much Difference.
Now, if the Mafter, who is to make the middle as the fmalleff
Piece, paint it as firong and warm as he is able, nay, as a Face in
full Proportion of Rembrant, it would be intirely againtt Nature,
and the Rules of Art. But, to return to our Example.

its Place, in that treating of what is to be underftood by a painted Ta.
ble, whether Lanmiskip, Hiffery, Pourtraiture, &cc.
Bur, before I leave this Subject, I mult Hill fart another Difficulty.
We know, that a large Painting is often copy’d in Little; and the con-
trary: Now, if, for inftance, all that is large in the Original, be lef
fened in Proportion in the Copy, how can they look alike! as in
the Delign with the two Doors is exhibited; in both which are
large Clouds, and in the other small ones; and all thats in the Offskip
teems more diftant in the one than the other. If the Offskip in the
small Pitture be that of the great one, by what can you prove ir?
fince the Objects, which, in the greateff Diftance in the fmall Piece,
are hardly vifible, appear, in the great one, to large and diftind. To
which Iantwer, that every thing appearing in the one, is and remains
in the other always the same, out so much nearer: And this is evi-
dent; for, is there any thing in the World, which, how remote foe-
ver, cannot be fill remoter? It has been formerly faid, that every
thing on Earth is subject to the Laws of Perspective, except the Sun,
Moon and Stars, and what elfe is feen in the Firmament, with respect
to their Forms; as for the Clouds, they are moveable Bodies, and there
fore muft be confidered as earthly Objects, leftening and enlarging ac
cording to their Dillance, Height and Lowness; all thefe Thingsl
tay, can go off and appreach, be diftant and near. Betides, there is a
Difference between a Copy and an Original, as well in the Form as iIss;
Itay (in the Form) becaute the one ought to be viewed afar off and
the other near: Moreover, it never happens, that the Copy is hung by
the Original; but the Fellow to it.

le; and only in the Shade, which, broke by the other side of the
Light, is gradually transformed into the Blue of it, in Proportion as
the Objects go off; or, to (peak better, till uniting with the Ofship,
they at laft disappear.
Confider allo the Difference between fmall Paintings in the open
Rir, and thofe within doors, in reference to the going of, and the Co-
104rS.
We fay firtt; that the fir without is the moft clear and bright
Light, in the Abfence of Sun-fhine; and tho' an Aparement mult needs
be lighted from without, yet it will be less in Force and Brighinels,
and therefore the Objects, more darkish, both in Lights and Shades.
Secondly, The Objects cannot fo vifibly grow faint in their going off;
becaule, by the Smallness of the Diftance, few or no Vajours are per
ceptible.
Thirdly, the Shades are not subject to any Alteration or Mixture,
but retain their natural Qualities; becaufe there is no other Light
within doors, than what comes thro' the Windows, and this has not
Power enough to cause any Reffexions, lave some little near the Win-
dow, nor give any Colour: So that by the Darkithnels the Ob-
jects, whether Pourtraits, Figures, Flowers, &cc. retain their natural
Colours intirely, as well in Sbades as Lights: Wherefore, fince the
Beauty and Purity of the Colours appear beft by the Serenity and
Brighiness of the Air, they muft contrarily abace in their Effects and
Force by means of the Darkness.
I hall here propole a small Inftance, for Explanation.
Let a good Maffer paint any thing, as a Pourtrait, Landskip, Fi-
gures or Cattle in Oil, as fmall and neat as a Miniature-painter, and
let both thefe Mafters chufe their Subjects moff beautiful and natural.
Now view the two Paintings together, and you will find, that the one
differs as much from the other as within door Light does from the open
Air. Tis therefore unnatural and againtt the Rules to us thet Warmih
and Strength of Colours, in order to force small and diftant Objects out
of their proper Plices, or to make the Window fy tewards us, inlead
of going off from us. We ought, moreover, to know, that Things
painted in Little can never be taken for the Truth, fince tis undeniable,
that the Life appears therein no otherwife than as at a Distance, viz.
through a Door, Window, or other Opening, whether within or with-
out-doors; wherefore they ought to be painted in fuch Manner, that,
when hung up, they may not appear like a painted Board, Clotk or
Flat, but a natural Windew or Deor through which the Life is really
seen:

Colears, but by the reciring and tender ones, broken by the interpoting
Air, according as the Weather is more or less clear or mifty: And
this, withour Exception of any Ordonnance, whether Landskig, 4r.

Experience will confirm the Truth, if you view your Picture thro'
2 Piece of fne Gaufe, somercbat bluiss; for then you will find the
Lights of your Objects gradually grow weaker in Proportion to their
Diftance; without lofing the Beauty of their Colours. It will even
give a Piece a certain Sofinels and Sweetness and great Decorum. Vou
may make the fame Experiment with another Piece of Gause of a grey
Coloar, in Imitation of forey Weather; and it will not only darken the
3

Light of the Objects, but alfo foul and maddle it, and make the Paint
ing look cold and ditagreeable.

felf, and the other pemingty so; for Figures in full Proportion are like
us who view them, in every Particular of Force, Afpelt and Colour,
except Motion: Which being granted, it may be calily apprehended,
if we will fubmir to Reafon, that there is a vall Difference between
large and fmall Ordonnances of Figures in full Proportion, and thote
half as big with respect to the interpesing fir, the only true Caule of
Things being more or less faine, and their going off, as well in within

Let us then rightly oblerve, in what manner fuch large Objects
ought to appear, that they may be natural and artful; but previouly
contider two Things.
1. Whar Light is the moft proper for them.
2. What Hundling is the moll natural for their Execution.
As for the Light, I think the common bet, and much more proper
than Sunthine; and tho' fome, who let up for the buono Guffe, are
continually talking of painting broad, it is nevertheless a great Errot,
as we have often laid, always and without Difference to ule that Mar
ner, fince tis not proper, in a common Chamber-light, (especially in
Figures as big as the Life, which ought to be in all respects like the

they should not be taken for Paintings, but the Lifeitself) to give them
broad Shades, but dubious and melting ones, to the end they may rise
and round; not Black, like Spagnoler, nor Grey, Vellow or Ruffet,
like Rembrant, John Lievens, and many other Italian, Duich and
Flemisss Painters, who, without Difference, bring Warmch, as they
call it, into the Shades to fuch a Degree as to fire them; on
ly to caule Force. Let this be duly weighed, left the Colour of the
natural, and perfect Life be negletted. in my Opinion, is belt to
make the Shade of the same Nature as the Stuf; exhibiring in all
Objects, whether Nudities, Draperies, Wood, Stone, either Red,
Vellow, Blue of Green, the moft proper Colour, as well in Light as
Shade.
As to the Force, I should not be fparing either of White or Black,
tho' many have pretended, that we mull not wte White: A good
Painter will attempt any thing. Vou muft not fuffer yourfelf to be
twayed by this or that Manner; follow Nature, and you will content

boldly, yet not, with Rembrunt and Lievens, to let the Colours run
down the Cloth, but lay them fnooth and even, that your Objects.
may feem round, and relieved only by Art, not by daubing. Let
the Agreement be to general, that in truth it may be faid the Fi-
gures are large, srongly painted and beldly handled.
People now-a-days think, that Painting has attained fuch a Perfecti-
on as not to admit of further improvements; fince the beautiful and
great Manner, the bon Gout and hot Colouring are, at this Time,
mely performed in France, Italy, the Netherlands and other Countries,
where Art ffourithes; but we do not find, now-a-days, Wits who en-
deavour to diftinguith themfelves among the Knowing, by nere Invent;-
ons. We had feveral of them some Time fince, of whom I thall name
but two, Rembrant, and John Lievens, whole Manner is not intirely
to be rejected, elpecially that of the former, as well for its Narural-
nets as uncommon Force; yet, we fee very few followed him, and
thefe, like him, fell thort at latt; notwithllanding some were, and hill
are, who affert, that Rembrant was able to do every thing which Art
and Pencil could effect; and that he furpaffed all Arcilts, even to this
Dav. Was there ever fay they, a Painter who cone so near Nature
in Ferce of Colouring, by his beautiful Lights, agreeable Harmony, prange
and uncommon Thoughts, &&c. Having such extraordinny Talents, in what

could be be deficient? and is not that enough to charm all the World, the
be had not prattifed a Manner which was in use long before.
But I defire thefe Men may know, that my Opinion herein is quite
different from theirs; tho' I muft own, I had formerly a fingular incli-
nation for Rembrunt's Manner; For as foon as I began to be fentible of
the infallible Rules of Art, I found myfelf under a Neceffity of re-
pouncing my Miltake and quitting his, as being founded only on loofe
1I hims and uncertain Grounds, without Precedent.
And now, methinks, I cannot any where better than here, thew the
Effelts of mignifing and diminishing Glaffes, and the various Opinions
fouching them.
Many imagine, that a Painting in Little, and the Life, feen through
a Diminithing-glats, are one and the fame; and that the fmall Lite,
seen through a Magnifying-glats, and a large Picture, appear alike:
But thefe Men are much mittaken, and as wide from Truth as the Eaff
is from the Well.
The Glats ground hollow or concave, fhews near Objects in their

Force, Beaury and Warua with a Diminution. And
The Glats ground riing or convex, contrarily, exhibits faint and dif
tant Objects in a full Proportion, dull and broken.
Now, ler any realonable Man view the two Pieces, the small one
werm and, iring, and the large, faint and weak, and decermine which
of them is molr like the Life or Nature! My Opinion is againtt both:
They are like a Man dreft in Woman's Cloaths, and the contrary;
for one is tor fring, and the other too weak.
But, admiting thefe Men to be in the right, and we were to fide
with them, we should, by this their Pofition and Application of it,
dilcover their wrong Notion; fince they make the large strong, and the
Imatt, eren as frong as the lurge. By which, and the aforefaid Effects
of the two Glaffes, the Mistake fufficiently appears, and Arcifts are
advertifed of it.

CHAP. XXIII. An Enquiry into the Difference between a large
Landskip ernamented with small Figures, and a small one with large,
with respect to the Hir; the Day being supposed clear in both.
70 be short and incelligible, we premife, that, in a Landskip
the fir is so governing, that all the Piece contains, whecher Off-
skip, Water, Fields, Trees, Coc. muft from it receive their
Decorum and Naturalnels, and at all Times of the Day, whether
Morning, Noon or Evening, nay, at Night alfo; for as the Airalters,
all the Objects lighted by it do the fame: If the Day be bright and
the Air clear, all Things appear fo; if it be Evening, they are dusky
and at Night, dark. The Mafter, who has regard to this effential
Point, mult needs fucceed, and be thought artful: And why: Becaule
he has, in that Part, fimply followed Nature as an infallible Guide:
Vet he ought to be certain in lighting the Objects according to their fe-
veral Natures, and to obferve, with me, whether there be a Differ
rence between a large Opening without Embellissments, and the contrary,
with respett to the ir. By the Air is meant, the fuperior Part,
which, in a clear Day, is commonly called, The Blue of the Sty.
We lay, that the two unlike Objects in Landship, to wit, one ona-
mented and the other plain, ought, in order to look natural, to be a-
tike clear, and neither lighter nor darker, if they both exhibir the
sume Hour of the Day? and if one were of a darker Blue than the or
ther, Tis a Miftake, and unjullifiable; for one of them mut needs be
contrary to Truth.
Now, it may be here objected, according to the old Way of think-
ing, that a Maffer of his Art may, for Decency's Sake, freely cor
rect and alter Narure when the is obstructing: But 1 anfwer, in few
Words, that, in that Cafe, Nature ought to command, and Art obey.
What can be the Purpofe to paint, in Landskip, the Blue of the Sky,
two or three Feet above the Horizon, as dark as if it were Evening
when all the Objects in the Piece are lighted with the urmofl Bright-
nets and Force, either fidewife or froming, altho' the Sun be fetting;
even, the Shades lighter than the upper Air: Confider how fuch Re-
prefentations mult look in the Eyes of the Knowing, and whether it
be otherwife than a Day-occurrence, or Stage-play reprefented in the
Evening. What Advantage would accrue, if every body had trus

Knowledge and Judgment in the Art, if we did not thew them Art:
What Lore can t gam! He, who knows Are, is very fenfible of what
it aims at; wherefore a Lover of Truth ought to fhun Fallities. A
Picture is a probable Dementration of Tbings; and the Knowledge of
visible Narure is like a Touch flone, by which Menjudge of the Truth
or Falhood of all they meet with: Even. Ignorants as well as the
Knowing are allured by Art if they find it like Nature; tho' they
are disterently affected; the former delighting moff in mean and com-
mon Things, and the latter in fublime and grand.
But, to return to the Point, and from the small to full Proportion,
I mean, Pieces from y or 6 to 10 or 12 Feet high: The Queltion is,
whether the light Blushness of the Styought not to begin higher above
the Horizon in a Piece of ro Feer than in one of g: I think it ought
not; becaute in boch, the armof Dilance is the same; and there is no
other Dirference between the great and small Picture, chan between a
Window half and quite open; as the Example in Plare KL. Vil. natu
rally thews; where are two WVindows of equal Height and Breadth,
one half fhar, and the other quire open, through both which, the
Landskip and Horizon are feen to rife 2 Feet and an half. Now, we
generally perceive, when the Sky is clear and without Clouds, that it
appears Blue; as if we faid, — Twere all Light. — affuming its
Colour flowly and far above the Horizon; and therefore some Land
ship painters act very improperly herein and againtt Narure: But Fi.
fare-painters especially are moft culpable; fuch, I mean, who, in their
Pieces, tho' ever to small, exhibit the Rir suddenty durk and deep Blue,
without confidering the Origin of BlueExperience reaches, that it
proceeds from Whire and Black, and is therefore in the Aforning,
light Blue; at Noon, Sky-blue; in the Evening, Azure; and at Night,
dark Bluc. In this MannerI divide the four Times of the Day, as in
the following Example in the Plsteaforefaid we, by double Harchings,
plainly thew; and not only the Tines, but allo how high the Blue be
gins above the Horizon and approaches towards it; thefe are letterd
A BCD for the Morning, Nosn, Evening and Night.
Ii will not be unneceffary, on this Occafion, to impart a Thought
of mine touching warm and weak Puinting, as well in Landskip and
Hiffory as fnall and great Life; fince it allo takes its Rife from this
Fountain of the Lights.
We find, that thofe, who are accultomed to a particular Manner
of Painting, have not the Power to alter it of any
Occafion whatloe

ule great Force and Warmth, paint every thing frongly, without Dif
ference, tho' ever fo small: Contrarily, one ufed to small Things, if
his Manner be weak, retains that Weakness even in the largeft Things,
and cannot ferch out the Force and Warmth of the other. A vall
Miltake, in my Opinion; becaule it is fuch an ealy Matter, and yet
produces to great an Effect; I mean, for him who governs his Work
by Rule; for who, having judgment, is ignorant, that a near Tree has
more Strength and Warmth than one at two hundred Steps Diftance?
Or that a Figure in full Proportion has more Force than one of one
Foot? I think neither of thefe Parties can find Fault with the Colours;
he, in the Great, that he has not weak ones enough, or he, in the
Ltthe, that he wants the flrong and warm, or cannot make them to,
by tempering: If the Knowledge be found, nothing but Will is want-
ing for good Performance.
But let us confider in what Manner we may, on this Occation, arm
ourfelves. Good Reafons ought to (way every body; yet Scruples of
ten make Men fearful of undertaking Things out of their Way; not
that they should not be able to perform them, but on an Apprehen
tion of falling from a good into a bad Manner; fince Experience thews,
that each fuppofes his own Manner the beft.
I think I have found out a Method for thofe accultomed to large
and Rrong Things, to fit them for the small and weak. The Cloth
jou defign to paint on, ought to be primed with a light Grey Ground
for the large Work, and with a dark and warm Ground for the small;
to that, having no other Patterns, whether Figures or Landship, than
warm and sirong ones, you may temper your belours accordingly, and
get rid of your old Cullom. Herein, a Pallet of the same Colour is al
to neceffury, that the Colours tempered on it may produce, in paint-
ing, the same Force or Weakness. And to thew, that this Method is
of greater Moment than some may prefently imagine, I shall relace
what once happened to myfelf.
A certain Gentleman had his Hallcieling lined with five Cloths,
grimed with a Pearl-Colour; and being afterwards defirous of
having fomething painted on them, propoted my doing it. Whereup-
1
on I made Defigns to his Liking, and had 4 Cloths fent home to me
(the middle one large and (quare, and three fmaller round ones) but in
lien of the fifth, (which was got rotten by Dampuess) a new one was fent
to me, not primed with a light Ground like the reft, but of a brqun
Colour. After I had deadcolour’d the Work and viewed it together,
I perceived, that the Shades in the laft Cloth were much browner and

E. F

258
Book V
Warmer than in the others; and tho' in finithing, I endeavoured, as
much as poftible, to help it, and bring it like the rell, ver something
remained in the Sbodes of another Nature; which fome Pertons judged
to be better chan chole of the other Cloths, (thole especially who were
impliciely addilted to the warm Mianner) without confidering in gene
ral whether Twas proper of not. Thus I found, that the Ground of a
Cloth may often miffead as, and put us befide the Mark, eitber in Near-
ness or Difance; but knowing the Reafon of it, if it happen again the
Fault is our own. And thus we may infentibly, and without Compul.
tion, pats from large Tbings into the small, and from the small into the
VurgE.
We hall further obferve on what Occafions the aforefaid Means may
be made ufe of to Advantage.
1. in paincing a light Landskip.
2. in painting Halls, Rooms, &cc.
2. in Night-pieces, Apparitions, and Candle-lights; and as well in
Lrtle as in full Proportion.
For thefe three particular Defigas, we may prepare the Grounds of
the Clorks thus. That for the Landstip ought to be pimed with pearl
Colour; that for an Apartment, with Umber; that for Apparition;or
Candie-light, with Colagn’s Earth, or Umber and Black. The firtt,
more or lels blaish, according to the Quantity of Sky; the second,

nets; yet the larger the more black. We think thofe Colours, belides
the Tints, very ufeful and neceffary not without Reafon; becaute they
have Affinity to the Nrure of the Subjects; the firtt, to the Blue of
the Sty; the second, to the Reffexiens; and the third, to the Shade.
I have often made it a Queftion, whether it were worth while to
mention thefe Particulars, becaute I am fenlible, some may think them
riffing; as I willingly own, they feem to be: But on better Confide
ration of the Matter, and how many Things are negletted which ei
ther offer of themfelves or seem trivial, tho' of abfolnte Ufe, my Su-
fpicion abared; with this Confolation, that how minure foever my
Thoughts may be, I shall be fausfied, if they any ways tend to the Ad
vantage and Improvement of Are, and Insiruction in it.
Wherefore, reaffuming the Subject, I fay, that the Cloth may be
prepared thus. The Colours, being ground up ftiff with fat Oil, ought
to be mixed very thin with Turpentume and the Cloth painted over,

with a foff Tool in this Manner. The Sky, Blue, and the Ground,
Grey or Green, more or lets dark as your Ordonnance and Delign re=
quire. Now, if it be asked, how we mull proceed in cafe of rifing
Objects, as Trees, Houles or other Things coming againft the Offship,

and above the Horizon, and which fill up a great Part of it! I an
twer, that my Meaning is not to provide fuch painted Cloths, with-
but previoully knowing, what we are to paint upon them; for we
mull firft skeech our Thoughts on Paper, and then conclude how much
or little Sky or Ground muft be painted Blue or Green, Vellow or
Black. In thofe Grounds we have no occafion for fine and coftly Co-
lours; common ones will ferve, if they have a good Body and cever
well. For the Blue, take indigo and White; for the Ground, Umber
and White, or Lamp-black and light Oker; for Architecture and other
Stonework, Umber, brown Oker, COc. The Ground thus laid, and
being dry, has three defirable Qualities.
1. Tis fit for Work, as being even and dull; wherefore the Colours,
how thin foever, take at firft; which a fmooth or gloffy Ground will
not admit without much Trouble.
4 Tis durable, by its Relation to the Tints and Colours painted
on it; which hold their perfect Beaury and Force; which they can-
not do, when the Ground is of another Colour or Tint, fich as White
upon Black, light Blue on dark Vellow, or Red, 6oc. in Time appear-
ing more and more through, tho' ever to farly painted

and defires to paint up his Defign at once; which otherwile cannot be
done without Dead-colouring.
This Method has ftill further Advantages than some may perhaps
imagine; tis particularly ufeful in Creling-pieces, not only in Acreal
Reprefentations, but alfo Bass reliess of one Colour, whether White,
Grey, Violet or yellowith.
Judge now, whether the Trouble of preparing fuch a Cloth be not
small, when compared with the great Advantage arifing from it.
As a Proof of it, I have oblerved of the great Barthelet, that
when he was to paint a Pourtrait with a purple or black Drapery, he
laid in the Drapery fat, with a fingle dark Purple or Black without
any Folds; and, on finithing, onty beightened and saded it, and thas
worked up the Piece at once.

7 H15 Light ought to be ranked among the Day-lights, as tak.
ing its Rife and Government from thence. This, commonly
called a Chamber-light, we divide into three Sorts.
The firtt enters thro' Doors, Windows, and other Openings, and pro
ceeding from the Air, thereby caules
The fecond, which is occationed by Reffexion; as from a Wall,
Ground or other Objects.
The third fublifts in irtelf; as proceeding from a Candle or Torch.
Thefe Lights have different Natures.
Thofe of the open fir are clean on the light Parts of Objects, and
do sof after then more than in the open Air, cauling the Light to be
broad, and the Shades dark.
The second falls mere or less pare on Objects according to the Colour
and Nature of the Grounds and Walls; their Shades being dim and dif
appearing, and only the decpest Shades visible and frong; the Room in
general, both above and below, being thereby lighted, as well by the
Force and Effed of the Wall within, as by the Groand witheut. Of

think, as we have often faid, very improper to be reprefented in a
Room.
Many have thought very improperly of thofe lights; taking, in 2
perverie Manner, the Liberty which Horace allows to Poets and Paint-
ers; and precending to help the Defects of Nature, do it in an extri-
ragant Manner, making no Scruple to break down a whole Wall of
a Room, to let in a beautiful Light on their Objects, as prongly as in
the open Air.
They even go fuch Lengths, that, tho' they have Doors and Win
dows, they give every thing their proper Ground fhades, except Win
dow-frames, Crosspieces and Piers; as if a Wall were pot a folid bo
dy as well as a Man, Table, Chair or other Furniture; imagining
they may do fo, that nothing may obfiract the Figures: But, in my O

spoil the Property of Things by reprefenting it.
in painting an Apartment, we ought well to consider the Arcbiteffure,
to aid it, and give it a preper Division, and thew a Door for Pallage;
As for the Windows, whether many or few, it muft appear by the
Objects, and by the Groundshades of the Cross-pieces and Piers; and
that, plain in Sun-thine, but dubious without it.
And, in order to make this laft Point cfear, (which in this Chapter
we chiefly aim ac) I shall, in the two Examples in Plate KLVill:
plainly exprets my Sentiments.
The firtl exhibies two different Lights falling in thro' two differenc
Windows; the one proceeding from the clear Air, and the other, by
reaton of a near Building before the Window, somewhat broke, little
of no Air being feen above that Building. Between the Windows is a.
large Pier or blank Wall.
Mark thofe Windows with the Letters A and B, and the blank
Wall with C, and then obferve, how the Shade, which the Pier C
gives on the Ground, is cut, on both Sides, by the Light falling in
thro' the Windows A and B, and how acute it terminates, and how
the Light A is weakened by that of B; moreover, what a thort Touch
of Light A gives, when that of Bgoes far into the Room:. As allo,.
that the Figure a, receiving the Light from A, is dusky, and Hara
hort Ground Chade, and the other Figure;, contrarily, receiving its
Light from B, is lighter, and its Light broader, and gives a longer
Ground-shade. Obferve further, that the nearer the Figures are to the
Light or Window, the purer and more plain are their (round-thadesy.
when, contrarily, the Column C. placed againtt the Pier C. gives a.
1
double Ground-fhade, the greater evercoming the less.

The second Example thews the fame Things, according to the Cor
dition of the Lights; which are altered and come in from bebind.
The third and fourth Examples, in Plare KLIR thew the fame
Things in Landship; for the same Obfervation prevails in both; with
respect to Light and Shade. As to the Colours in the open. Air and.
their Alcerations, I have faid enough of them in a proper Chapter.
I think it great Heedlelsnels, in many Painters, who, in giving
their Within door-Objects a Side light, do not mind, whether they
Rand on the Near or Offfide of the Window letting in the Light; nor.
confider, that the Light, coming in thro' a narrow Opening, (preads,

1
the Arciff, which may be of Service to him, I judged is necelfs-
1y to fubjoin this Chapter to the Lights, tho' we have to largely
greated of their Natures, Qualities, Forces and Effelts.
A Drawing and Our line, how fine foever, are not agreeable before
they are shaded; and when this is done as Nature and Art require, it
exales the former, and gives an addicional Lustre to Nature; For a so
ber Light fuirs not with butting Figures, with respect to Within
door-Reprefentations, becaute it abates the Elegance and Art of the o
ther. As in The Marther of Cxfar in the Senate-house; or, The Death
of Cato. But, let me not be hereby suppoted to overthrow my for
mer Affertion, that Sun fhune is not proper within doors; fince, on
foch Occafions as those, there muft be found fuch a Medium in the
Light, as there is in the Colours between the more and less beautiful,
and as we have thewed to be, between Sun-fhine and common Light.
Again, this Light would be very improper in 4 Salatation of Eli-
Labeth and Mary, or, The Stery of Stratonica; or that of The Qued
of Sheba: Thefe require a more tender, foft and fweet Light, and
therefore a common ofe.

If this be not obferved, a good Out line may be spoiled; as when
a Shade should happen to fall on the rifing Parts, or a Ground shade
pass over them.
Were we to make an Hiltory, wherein both Pastions, the sedate and
firring, should meet, requiring confequently, an Oppesstion in the
Lights, we ought to place the afting Figures forwards on the firft
Ground, as having the Predominancy, and to adapt the Light to them
as much as possible.
Accordingly, a Story nott occurs to me, wherein the three principal
Pasions muft meet in one Composition, 1 mean that of Ahafuerus, Eff-
her and Haman; Efther thews a supplicating and meek Posture and Coun-
tenance; The King dilcovers Wratb and Passion; And Haman, Affe-
nishment and Fright. Now, in order to caft well the Light on thote
Figures, according to my Apprehention, I would dispofe Epber in the
greateff Light, fomewhat in Profile; The King, in the srongeft, 1 mean,
where it falls moft and has its chief Effect, and increate it by the Force
of Colours; but Haman I would place fitting on the other side of the
Table, in a dim Light, the rather to fereen him from the King's
Wrath: And, as it is a Feall or Banquet prepared by Epber, where
every thing is royal and magnificent, I think the common Light here the
moft proper ; becaute the Sequel of the Story and the King's Rage are
but accidental.
We shall conclude this Book with the following
Ordennance; or Table of the Lights.
Here, the beautiful and darting Aurera is diltipating the fogey Va-
pours of the gaptly Night, by her agreeable Day-break, that the moft
perfed Productions of rich and liberal Nature may appear in their
true Qualities, Forms, Colours and full Luftre; the defcends from on high,
holding a clear lighting Lerch, and driving dark Night into fubterra-
Reous Hollows.
The more radiant Phabus, luting in his Chariot, is mounting out of
Thetiss Lap, gilding all things under the arure Heavens, not excepting
the Snow-whice Lillies.
The chafte Diana, with her harp-pointed Silver Horns, is fatistied
with what her Brother imparts to the World, as ferving not only to
revive, but alfo to be a Beacon to the Paths of Mortals.

fince any Excets is borh ridiculous and hurtful, as well to the Agent

himself, but otfers, according as his (orks pleate or displeafe; and, as
every Creature kas a particular Liking, and, when in Company, they

judicious Arriff should Itreuouly endeavour to qualify himself for every
Pesfr’s Tyle; like an expert Apethecary, who ffores his Shop with
all proper Medicines for the general Good, and thereby gets Wloney.
Let this juffice to hint, that a Landskip- painter mult not be rvedded to

very powerful Cribries, with reffieit to Sight, when by a fisett
Harmonr of Colours and elegant Mlanagement, it diverts and pleales

Chap. I.
The Dispesstion is an artful bringing together of irregular Objelts;
which nevertheless feem not to be againtt Nature, or impoffible.
The Colouring is a Conjunction of proper Colours in the aforefaid
Objects, according to their Situations and Qualities, agreeing with the
Nature of the Sir in fuch manner as to repofe and pleale the Exc.
And yet all chefe Qualities cannot alone produce a perfelt Landskip,
unlets a good Choice precede; which contifts in joining together Variety
of Objects, viz. Woods with Viftos, wherein the Eye may lofe itfelf;
Rocks, Rivers, and Water-falls, green Fields, &cc. delightful to the
Eye. Herein lies the Stress of 2 Landskip, and Painting is very like
Nature, with respect to Things inanimate; not to mention many others
as the Embellifhments; which give it the utmofl Perfection. However,
this Variety confifts not only in the Difference or Irregularity of the
Objects, as Trees, Hills, Fountains, and the like, but in the Diversity
of each of them; for inftance, bending and frait Trees, large and small
Hills, wrought and plain Fountains, Cottages and Palaces, green and
rufet Lands, &cc. The same Diverfity is to be oblerved in Colsuring,
according to the Seasons of the Tear; that Lovers may not he cloved
by producing, with the Cuckoo, always the fame Thing; as, Stir
and Motion, crooked and mif-shapen Bodies of Trees, waving Branches,
barren Grounds, blue Mountains, or Beafts, Birds, Huntings and the
like; or, contrarily, always Repose and Quictness, frait Stems, clipp’d
Trees, level Grounds intirely gre.2, standing Water, and the same Light.
Colour and Nature.
We have formerly faid, that a Table or Picture hung up, and view-
ed at a determinate Diftance, appears as the Liss, without-deers; of
which, the Frame thews only the Thickness of the Sill wherein tis put,
or Wall, againtt which it hangs. The Queltion is now, whether inch
a painted Opening can be natural and deceiving, without lixing a Point
of Sight and an Horizon equrl with the Eye of the Spettator? and
whether it be the fame, to place them higher or lower! And further,
whether the Thickness of the Frame be iufficient to thew the Thick-
nets of the Wall, without continuing it upon the Cloth? I fay poft-
tively, — No, — and that fuch an Opening cannot be natursl.
much less deceiving, if one of thofe Requifites be wanting; which I
prove thus. Take a Chair, and fit at the Window with your Eye
jull level with the Sill, and then you will oblerve that the Horizon,
of greateff Diftance parting the Sky and Earth, will, as I may say,
approach towards ir, and be parallel with your Sight, and that tngre,
od.

Herizas alfo rife, and that your Eye is always level with it, difcovering
here and there Objects on the Ground Now, confider the Infuffice
eacy of your Pilture, when its Point of Sight does not agree with
your Exe, and how Nacure, joined to your imagined Art, is per-
verred, your Deceit made apparent and your Intentions fpoiled. It is
therefore evident, that the Picture, in which the Point of Sight is placd
mull determine your Dillance, and that the Eye ought never to
leove the Herizen, but be always level with it. If the kye be lower than
the Point of Sight, all the Objects mult needs feem to tumble forwards,
and the Fore-ground to fink. If you are above the Point of Sight, the
Fere-ground rifes, and all the Objects are tumbling backwards. How
then can this feem natural and deceiving? Wherefore there is no other
Way, than to hang the Pilture in a certain Place, and fix a Diftance
whence it is to be viewed without Alteration. As for the Frame, it is
necessary to shew the Thickness of it on the Cleth, in order to know, at
ence, tbhe Ditance from whence you ought to view it; because its angular
Rays are directed to the Point of Sight.
I am not infentible, that this Pofition may feem firange to some;
who will object, that they never obferved any fuch Thing in Poustin,
Titian, Brif or Francefce Moly, or other good Mafters: But the old
Saving shall plead for me; Example is better than Precept. For they
endeavour to follow the Miftakes but not the Virtues of thofe exce-
lent Mafters. I am fure, that, had, thote great Mafters thought of
thefe Obfervations, they would not have rejected them. Do you want
Demonfiration, that every good Mafter approves of what 1 fay, and
follows it ? Shew me but one Picture, Drawing or Print of theirs, ex
hibiring aed Vilto out of an Hall or Chamber, wherein they
have forgor to exprets the Thickness of the Framing or Walls; fince, o
therwife they mulf depart from the Naturalness, and we would fay, that,
inflead of an Off-ditance, they had reprefented a Picture or Tapellrj.
I therefore conclude, that if Nature require this in a Picture, it is still
more neceffary, when we would have the Picture taken for Nature it
feff, in order to deceive even Maffers. But fome think, — If Iar-
rive in the Art, to their Heights, I shall be satisfied. — In the mean
time Art delpairs of attaining greater Luflre by further Improve
Mments.
But, to reaffume our former Polition, my Opinion is, that what has
been faid ought to be regarded, when we meet with any thing in
Halls, Chambers, Galleries and the like, whether in Niches, above or
in Cbimseys, of on other Occations: And the main Point is, to place well

the Herizon according as the Piece fands high or low. My ufual Prac-
fice was, to make the Thickness of Walls plainly appear in my Paint-

ings; and would always have done it; but on Painting, on a Time,
for a Lover of Quality, was obliged to alter it for his Pleafure; on a
Surmife, I did it to fave Work, not for the Good of it; aftirming,
that the Painting was thereby dock’d, and too much incumbered:
But the Child muft have a Name; he imagining, that the Alteration
made the Work look larger.
Here let it not be thought, that my Piece was wholly taken up with
the Ordonnance, and the Thickness afterwards painted upon it; becaute
that would be great Folly. I frft squared out the Thickness, and then
adapted my Delign thereto, as being more convenient than afterwards
to paint the Thickness over it, and thereby dock too much of the
Work.
Now, to give the findious Artiff a right Notion, as I think, how
to compote a good Landskip, after an eafy Manner, let him con-
fider.
1. The Nature of his Subject.
2. What Country he is to reprefent.
3. What Seafon of the Vear, what Month, and what Hour of the
Day.
4 Whether the Subject require Sun or Moon-fhine, clear or mifty,
rainy or windy Weather.
Having fixed thefe Points, let him proceed to feek proper Materi-
ats, bringing them together, agreeable to his general Design, and dif
poting the Objects in their proper Places, each according to its Na-
ture and Quality.
Next let him place the Point of Sight in the middle of the Piece,
higher or lower, as he would have lets or more Sky or Ground, con-
fidering whether the Ground is to be a Level or not, and thus to order
the Figures equal with the Eye, to difcover directly whether the
Painting be leen thro' an high Window in a low Ground, or from a low
Ground to on bigh; for tis commonly known, that if Things be feen
from an Height, the Figures ought to he under the Herizen, and when
viewed from a low Place, they mull rife above the Horizen.
Having done this, let him chule a proper Light, falling in either
from before, behind or afide, to light the Objects accordingly: And
then to difpole the principal Object (if posfible, and the Subject per-
mil) in the belt Place, in the midille of the Piece; at leat from off the

ings. The By-io:ts mult be foirable to it, the becter to explain the
Riatter.
If the Subject be a Wood, it ought to be adorned with Woodgeds,
Giks or Terms, Tonbs, Siats for Refose, Weednymphs and many o-
ther Things groper to it.
If a River, it may be handled in the fame Manner, with the Ad
dition of River-gods, Nuiades or smimming Water-nymphs, Fishermen,
Swans and other jach Ornaments.
If a field be the chief Object, it may be fet off wich Shepherds and
Sregherliffes, Couferds, Bacchanals and others.
Rocks and Cares require the fame Management; with this Caution,
that the Fye be taken with the principal Object enly, without other Re-
gard to the By-works, than as Aids and Incidents; for in fuch Condud
hes the Beauty and Goodness of a Landskip.
As to the Ornaments of modern Landship, fuch as of the famous I.
verdingen, Pynatker, Ruzsdaal, Meucheron and others who follow the
atern Manner, they do not call for the aforefaid Embellithments, as
having other fufficient Matter, viz. Cottages, Fishermen, Carriers,
Waggons and tuch daily rural Occurrences, which are as proper to it
as the Antige; for the Decorations alone, in my Opinion, make a
Landship cirter Antrgue or Modern; unlels we exhibit modern and
17

kmen Plecis, wherein the Antigue would be very improper, as Broy
8it, Briland Hans Bol have done, without Diftinction between the
loweir Life and what is better. For Nature is in her Objects now, as
the was a thouland Vears ago; Woods, Fields, Mountains and Waters
are always the fame; and therefore Ristare is mortern, that is, imper-
fert: But the is Antique and perfect, when we judicioully adorn her
with unrommon and magnificent Buildings, Tambs and other Remains of
Antignity; which, in Conjunction with the Ornaments abovemencioned,
compose an antique Landskip. Bur when a modern Prospeft on the Rbinn
is deck’d with antigue Froures and Stories, it mult look ridiculous; lince
Cottages and civil and military Architecture will evidently difcover the
prudent Folly of the Mafter, tho' otherwife excellent in 3oth Alaaners

C. H A P. II. Of the Light, Form and Grouping of Objects in
Landskips.
R T us now proceed further, in confidering the principal Qua-
liries and Properties requifite in a fine Landskip: Thefe, in my

Opinion, confiff
1. in a good Difpolition of the irregular Objects, as well with re-
srelt to their Matter, Shape and Form, as their Colour.
2. in the Number and grouping them.
g. in a good ordering of the Light.
By well disposing the irregular Objects, we produce Life and Motion;
the Objects confift of crooked, frait, awry, high and low; and by
the Colours we effect the fame; when one thing is faint and weak, ano-
ther melcing, this Rrong, that hard.
The Grouping confitts in joining thofe irregular Objects; as of two
Bodies on two different Grounds, ther on the Fore-ground ought to be
maller than the other on the second; thus, if a litting Figure come
forward, a flanding one muft be placed behind it; and on the third
Ground, a decumbent Figure; on the fourth, a climbed one, and be-
yonud it a fanding Figure again, CSc. Trees, Rocks, Buildings, Cartle
and other Things occurring in Landskip may be disposed in the same
Mlanner so far as concerns the Irregularity of Objects; which, in
cheir Matter and Colour, I shall thew in the following Example. See
PlateL.
I suppofe then, in a Piece, five Grounds with the Offship; of which,.
the fourth is the largeft. On the Fore-ground, I place a fuse of dark
Perfhiry, number’d s. On the second Ground, a Fountain, number’d
4 On the third Ground, an Hedge, number’d 2. On the fourth
Ground a Starue, number’d s. And the fifth is a fow Offskif, number’d
1. Thus much may fuffice as to Grounds going of behind each o
ther; the same Disposition ought to be obleived on a singhe or level
Grounds.
As for the Light, its principal Management lies in oppesing Brown-
efs and Darkness to middling and greater Light: But when two Lights.
are to fet off each other, the bolour must effict this; as for inflance,
when a lighted Figure is to come off againtt a light Oftship, the for¬
mer mult certainly be of a darkith Colour, as having no Shade; and

then


51

272
Book VI
then it will produce a good Effect: For the chief Management lies in
placing a warm-coloured Objett againft a light, faint and weak Ofship;
contrarily, light and faint Gelours againft dark and warm Grounds; the
foremel and sirongef Object againft the deepeft Lointain; and the Objects
furtter off, againt nearer Parts of the Offship: And thus, light Ob.
jects againtl dark, and the contrary.
The Artiil alloought to obferve, that two Lights muft never be above
earb ofber, unless one be rissbly different from the other in Force, er
ther in Coloar or Tint, left one feem to run into the other; which, at
a Distance, would be a prepofterous Union.
Moreover, Part of the Lointain should always be broken, and the
Eye, on one Side or the other kept nearer, eitber by means of a Wood,
Rock, Building or other Ob,e.t. A Part of the Herizon alfo should al.
ways be seen; or, for want of it, some level Object, such as a frenting
Wall, Colonude, or the like. This will produce Satistaction to the Eye,
and Elegance in the Piece.
No one will deny, that Anequal Numbers are the most perfect; ac
cording to the Demonftration both of Philosophers and Mathematicians.
This incquality 1 alfo obferve and follow in my Disposition of Figures,
thus
Firfl, I place one Figure on the Fore-ground; then, three on the
second; tws on the third; and foar on the fourth Ground; and then
again, one; and to forth: And thus, as well on a single level Ground
as where they happen one bebind another. Thefe unequal Numbers
in the Grougs are, certainly, not of the leaft Moment in Landskips.
As to the Colour mentioned before, tis to be especially noted, that
the Collar which is predeminant, and has the chief Place in the Piece,
mult no where elle be feen than with little Parts, 1 mean, of less
Branty, Quantity and Dignity.
CHAP. III. Of the Byernaments in Landships.
T is nfual for Landskip-painters to have a particular inclination
for one Choice; one affecting wild and defolate Prospects; another,
repoted and foff ones; and a third, northern or frigid Views, Sun
and Moon-fhine, Water-falls, Downs, watry and woody Prospects.
And the Reafon is, becaute moft People, by a Rrange Impulfe, feem
rather to covet the Gifts of Narure than the Heaventy; which afford
what

what is whole and most perfett: in a Word, they feek only a Part,
the all be to be got. This proceeds from Touth and Ignerance, want-
ing fundamental Knowledge, and therefore not judging, what is most
beautiful and profitable; nay, what they themselves are fit for. But it is
moff unaccountable, that many Landskip-painters are not able to em-
bellith their own Works: To which, fome may object, that as they
have not made it their Practice, to they are content with handling fin¬
gle Prospects well, leaving any thing elfe to the Owner's Difpotal. A
fad Story, that they cannot do their Work without Help! Whence
is evident, of what Moment if is for a Landskip-painter to embel-
lith his own Work, whether the Delign be his own or borrowed;
fince certainly, if he be Mafter of his Art, he mull allo know what
is moft fuitable in his Picture; not Triffes, or Figures to no Purpose;
but Hifteries, Fiftions or Parables, taken from Scripture, Ovid, or TEjep;
Ornaments which will enrich the Work. But this is feldom done; be-
caule few have Time to (pare, or love Reading. As for me, I would
rather want Prints and Drawings than Books. As an Hiffory-painter,
I make ufe of Books, and Detcriptions of Landskips and Bealts: But
were 1 a Landskip-painter, I should provide Books of Hisfory; for
what should I be the better for exercifing one particular Part, of which
I am Mafter, and neglecting others as neceffary to be known? I need
not learn what I already know; but tis impoffible to get Skill in
Things without inquiring into them. Have 1 Time for peraling No-
vels: Why not allo for neceffary Things! Am 1 curious to know the
State of the War, or defirous of Peace for the Sake of Art: Of what
Advantage is the Peace, if I do not qualify myfelf to meet it?
s there are few or no Painters who have no particular Manner fo
few are qualified for Embellishment; fince every one ftrives to excel in
tomething, and to get a Name by a certain Wenderfulness therein, er
ther by beautiful Colours, extravagant Draperies, broad and funny
Lights or round and dusky ones; which offen (poil a Work inffead of
bettering it : Thefe they cannot forbear (their chief Talent lying in
them) the they frequently have a contrary Effect, when they are to
adorn other Men’s Works. We mult alfo oblerve, that there are twe
Sorts of Byernaments; the necelfary, and the unnecesfary. The necesfury

ments. The unneceffary are the moveable ones, viz. Men, Beafts, Birds,
and the like; which, with respect to Landskips, cannot be confidered
as neceffary, but only as tending to give the Pieces Life, that they may
not pall but delight the Exe.

To be more plain in this Point, we shall confider, what a Painter
ought to eoferes and shan in the By-ernaments.
1 tay then, that tis very indecent to place a Woman alone, relting
near a Priagus; much more, in the Company of Men, unless you would
exbibir a Stranpet. Tis allo improper, that a Woman, well dreft,
sould fir alone by a Wayside, or in a Wood, or fland prattling with or.
dinary Peegl. Tis much more proper to make a Man sitting, and a
Woman pafing &:, than the Weman sitting and the Man pasting by, or
Folding Ducourse; undys be be inquiring the Way. Tisallo much bec-
ter, that a fiting Man shew the Way, than one who is pafting along. Ii
there be a Company of Men and Women, let not the Men be idle, and the
Women badin; and, if a Weman be reling by berself, de not affign ber
a greater Burthen than she can conveniently carry alone, wbetber Bundles,
Trunks or Fefels. A Woman of Fashion should never travel alone thre
Woods or Tallrs, effecially if youthful, without the Company of, at leaf,
a Dafder Chill. Stepberds and Sbepherdeffes, Husbandmen and We
men, ftit well together. Where there are no Sbeep, a Sbepherd or Pi.
fir, or Laffer with Chaplets of Flowers, are improper; because such Peopl
are not fent into the Field to prattle, but work; tis better to inquire of
fer the Stefferd than the Skeep. Country peoples Children are seldom

witkin-ders in the Sammer-rime, but generally abread in the Field with
their Purents; beting for Birds Nefts, gathering Weed or Flowers,
dizging Hiles, making Garlands, and in other childiss Aftions. In mad

2 good Mafter
He is an happy Painter, who knows how to adjult his By-ornaments
to his Landship, and this to them; thereby making both remarkable:
But he decerves greater Commendation, if he govern all Things by the
Landsk:p. The Figures or By-works are certainly of no less Momen
than the Landskip itfelf; yer he may be farisfed, if he continually en
dearour to make the one as good as the other. Such an Arriff is much
preferable to others; for the frequent Ufe of Prints, or other Mer:

Ideas, and fir up the Mind (I muft even acknowledge, that I should
have been infufficient without their Aid) but you mult get truly fen-
Rible what Lengtbs you may go in the Thest, not to fall into the com-
mon Error, out of which tis difficult to extricate yourfelf.
in treating of the immoveable By-ornaments, we mull obterve, that
nothing is more difpleating in a Landskip, than always to see Houses be-
kind, againt the Offskip; and, on the Sides, nothing but Trees and Hills,
or scarce so much as one Stone upon another: This Repetition mult needs
be difagreeable; wherefore tis no Wonder, that thofe, who are igno-
rant of Architeffure, avoid it as much as postible: But it is furprizing
to me, that many Landskip-painters will not be acquainted with that
Art; even rather never delire to exhibit it (how beautiful foever) than
to be at the Trouble of learning it: Or of following the Models of
others, which are to plentiful, and made for fuch Purpofes. A Point
to eafily artainable, and giving a Piece to great a Decorum. I have
been long Rudying the Caule of it, and can find no other than a Want
of inclination and Knowledge of its Virtues and Value: Tis eut of the
way to think that Landskips confift only of Trees, Hills and green Fields,
without Houses; or, if there be Buildings, Ruins or Triumphal Arches,
that then it is no mere a Landskip; since no one will take an History in a
Landskip for a Landship, or a Piece with Arckitefture and some Trees,
for a Landskip or Hiffory, but a Prospect with Buildings. A Landskip,
fet off with an hundred fmall Figures, will never pats for a Figure-
piece: But, without Figures or Houfes, it is like a Wilderness or for-
lon Country infected with the Plague, and where confequently, no
Houles are flanding: It would indeed be a very proper Greenland-
view.

THE Tombs, exhibited in Landskips, require particular Notice;
as giving not only a good Decorum, but allo a Probability to
the Places of their Situation; that they may not be contradiftery

The moft fure Method is, when you introduce fuch, a Piece of Stone-
work, firt to chufe a proper Place for its flanding, where it may be
most conspicuous to Paffengers, in order to draw their Attention; where-

fore they are made more or lets fumptuous and elegant, according jo
the Condition and Dignity of the Deceased, or thote who caute them
to be fet up. They are commonly placed in the Fields near bigh
Roals; or, at the Entrance of a sbady Grove, or elfe within it; yet in
Iuch a Manner as to be eafily approached, and feen by thofe who pass
by. If they be caily and finely adorned with Figures and other cary’d
Work, they are ufually fortihed againft the Injuries of Time; fome
are crowned with Arches, or elfe with fmall Pediments and Mout
dings lupported by Columns; and topp’d with a Copper Vase placed be.
Tacck tie Children rurning on Pivots, and holding lron Clappers, with
which, when moved by the Wind, they firike on the Copper, and
create 2 great Noife; their Motion was occalioned by an Hollowness
in their Backs: And this was done, they fay, to drive away Devils
and evil Spirits, who, as they imagined, continually haunted the
Graves of the Dead. Some of thefe Tombs were encompaffed with
low clofe Walls, to fence them againft the North-wind. They were
mot Times placed on raifed Groand or Hillocks, elpecially in defolate
Countries; and we need not question the Goodnels of their Founday
ons, tho' we often see trem in Ruins or funk down; fince nothing, tho'
ever to frong, can refifl eating Time. Iis not improbable, that about
tuch Places were Benctes for Reft; and, the more to draw the People,
they fomerimes made Fountains near them. The Athes of the De-
ceated were commonly repolited in a certain Orn or Bex placed on the
Top of the Tomb, or elfe in a Niche near it, elegantly carved, and in
scribed with Fieroghpbic Letters or Characters.
Thofe Graves or Tombs were fo adorned with Emblems and Figures,
as alwars to make us fentible, whether they were facred to an Heroi,
Philefefher, Starefman, filvan Deity, or who elfe; if we may credit
the Remains, and ancient Ifriters. II would be roo redious to ename-
race all the Parriculars touching thefe Tombs; and as thofe Things
terve only for By-ornaments to Painters, I think what I have faid is
fufficient, with the Addition of what cancerns their Materials: Thefe
were Various, viz. Perphiry, Tusper, all Sorts of Marble, red, black
and whice; affo Cepper and other Metals; and fometimes ordinary Stone.

Cottages and Country houfes are ufually low, having their greateft
Conveniency and Extent below; and as the Inhabitants poffels bur few
Goods (no more than what will fupply their Neceffities) their Rooms
are but few. Thefe Dwellings are plain and mean, moftly built with
Wood or common Stone: They have neitber Order, Disposition or Di=
visson. They fometimes wattle them with a Weaving of Reeds and
Russes, clayed over. The Roofs are thatcb’d, and not much window’d;
commonly dark within, and Imeared without with a light Colour, Red,
White or Grey, that they may be feen at a great Diftance. Thefe
Houles have often Wells or Water troughs near them, or elle Fountains
or Cifferns hollow’d out of a Tree, or made of Stone. The Fountains
are mean and artless; but near the Town, they are sumptaous, and
magnificently adorned with Starnes and ether Ornaments. We allo
find Vafes or elegant Pots with Balsreliefs, fanding on high Pedeftals,
above Reach, to preferve them from Damage. Sometimes they are a
little decayed and broken, or ruined by Time and Weatber; as allo by
the Barbarity of Soldiers; as may be perceived in the Fragments of
Columns lying up and down in the Reads, or near them; likewife Pieces
of Frizes with Balsreliefs; and beautiful Cornices, the Remains where-
of, and their Basements are still fanding. We fee alfo, about the Place,
Pieces of broken Coleffes; tome half within Ground, others lving tum-
tid into a Morass. nd, in the Weeds appear Stene-lions and Lioneffes,
ieting on Pedeftats, and spenting Water eut of their Mouths. On Hand-
jails they ufed anciently to place Sphinses, if their Meanings did not
allude to the Secret of Sciences; for then they commonly supported Co-
Juns, Pyramids and Tombs. They uted frequently, as tis Kill fome-
times the Cultom, to raife Heaps of Stones bearing Inscriptions and
Charafters. They likewile fet up Pofts for Guides, or Figures for the

CH AP. V. Of brautiful Colcuring in Landskips.
I any thing charm the Sight, I think tis the beautiful Green of
Trees. How do we long for the lovely Spring! Is any thing more
refrething to the Eye than the firff Greens of that Seafon! Spirits
and Diverfions feem then to revive in all Crearures. If a real Prosped
have fuck Effect, that of an arrful and agreeable Landskip has not
much less, wherein the bright Green and other delightful Colours
thine.
But, tho' it is not probable, that a Landskip painted intirely Greet
should pleate more than one in sout and Grey-green Colours, yet we
ought not to use Verdegrease to ferch out a fine Green; fince, tho' it be
the moft beautiful, ver is not the mot pleasing to the Eye; and moreo
ver, very fading and changing.
It is neverthelels to be lamented, that Men who pretend to great
Skill in painting Landships, incirely banith beautiful Green out of
their Works, and introduce, in its Place, Black, Vellow and other
tuch Colous.
Iis true, that Plants and Herbs differ as well in their Natures and
Qualiries as Chapes and Colours; that some are of a beautiful Green;
others, Blue; some, Vellow or Ruffet; others, Grey; some, of a fenny;
others, of a warry Colour; nevertheless Art reaches us not to imitate
the faded and mean, but what is moft charming and agreeable. In the
Diverfity aforefaid we fee the abject and the mean, and the beautiful anl
most beautiful.
If now it be faid, that the Artiff ought to exhibir every thing that
is beautiful, as well as the contrary, and that he only apes Nacure; 1
allow it; but then he muft be an imitator of well-formed Nature, and
elecantly paint her mot perfect Parts.
But by my Pofition, that beautiful Green is beff and moft charmif
in a Landship, let me not favour the perverfe Opinions of some, tha
Colours cannot be too beautiful, either in Hiftory or Landship, do
they exceeded Nature irfelf (of this I have largely fpoken in the Chap
tor of the Harmony and placing of Colours) for at that Rare, how cs

one Colour fet off another! What becomes of the Harmony or Con-
junction of Colours, when, as in Musick, high Tones do not agree
with the low? How can Gold be fet off by Gold; or Pearls, by
Pearls? Were all Thinge compoted of thofe two precious Bodies,
Richnels would not be apparent. The Proverb fays, Tenues ornant Di-
ademata Cund. That is
The Gold of Crowns may beaft its native Worth,
But meaner Objects bring its Lusire forth.
Many Painters have err’d in this Parricular; of which I shall give
one Inftance. A certain Artiff had once painted a Landskip, wherein
the firft and second Grounds, and every thing belonging to them, ap-
peared beautiful and nacural; but on the third Ground all was grey
and foul: On this laft Ground he had placed a Man in a beautiful ut
tramarine Garment, as bright as if he had been on the Fore-ground.
He was told, that thole two Things were unnatural and Oppolites; I
mean, a soul and muddy Green and so beautiful a Blue Garment; which
was moreover (as the Man was walking in the Sun) painted as bright
and beautiful in the Shade as in the Light, tho' the Light should have
been more broke. But the main Error lay, in breaking the Green of
the Ofskip too much, and not at all bringing down the beautiful Blue
Peffment, tho' at the same Distance. This Example may fuffice to thew,
that the Parts ought not to be broken or fouled to suddenty, tho' we
fee it done by many, in order to make the foremolt Parts look beau-
tiful and Rrong. Nature thews no such sudden Afteration, nor clear
Weather tuch Miflinels in Sun-Chine.

CHAP. VI. Of the leating of Tiees.
A NY Painters find the leafing of Trees an hard Task. Moft
I of them in this Point ape the Manner of this or that Mafter,
without confulting or fludying the Life: By which means,
their Leafing commonly becomes fet and fliff, and alreays of one Man-
ner; infomuch that we cannot diftinguith, in their Pictures, the Elm
from the Willow, or the Oak from the Linden.
Nature inftrults us to know them from afar, by their different Co-
lours as well as by their Growths and Shapes; wherefore, to proceed
regur

reguiarly and gain Eminence, in this Study, you ought exactly to
objerte the Life, and the soveral Sorts of Green and Leafing seen at a
Didance, whether they are close and mafty, or thin leaved and branched,
and whether they hang in Clufters, or unformly on their Boughs. Mind
miely the Difference of their Colours in their feveral Kinds, as well
while growing, as in Perfection and Decay. Allo the Sizes of their
Bodies, ber: or long; and whether they grow ftrait or crecked, in dry
or Uutry Plices.
Another ditticult Point, but which caufes the greateff Decorum, is
the Roundness or Relief of the Trees: A good Method for effelting
this, is, to obferve how large the Spread of the Tree is; fuppole it z0
of 40 Feet. The apper Roundnys or Nearlide mult have the srongel
Light and Shade; diminithing gradually every gor 6 Feet; and the
Extrenmities to melt into the Sky or other By-work, tho' the Light should
happen to fall, into the Piece from a Side; for the more the Light
approactes you, the pronger it touches: nd if, on that Occafion, you
light and heighten the uimoft Edges, it can add nothing to the Relief
becaute the Light rounds off too faddenly; and having once painted
it too flrong, you cannot help it by glazing, without muddling; fince
it will always appear diffind from the other Parts as well in Colour as
Nealncks
There is alfo as great a Difference between the Bodies of Trees as
their Leaves; fome are more beautiful and Painter-like than others;
thefe again more ftrait and found; those differing in Colour from o
there, cec. But a chief Regard is, not to place Asp or Linden-leaves on
Oaken Bodies, nor those of the Willow upon Elm; for each Stem muf
proditce its own Leaves; tho' this Condult be not heeded by many.
Vou ought alfo not to put young and beautiful Leaves upon an old
Stem; for the former is liks fetting a Mans Head on a Monkey's
Carcals, and the latter like parching a Childs Face upon an old and
decayed Man's Body.
We likewife often fee, in Commonlight Landskips, the Leafing le
very sarp and edgy againft the Sky: whereas Nature teaches, that even
the Leaves of the foremel Trees unit with the Sky on their Extremi
-ies, and appear dull againtt it; and in the Offskip ftill more dubious.

CH AP. VIl. Of the placing and fellowing of Landships.
F IN D nothing more difadvantageous and irkfome to a Painter,
than to wed himfelf to one Manner of Representation: Nature her-
felf and the following Precepts will shew the Error of it.
Firft, with respect to the feveral Places where the Piltures are to be
hung; for I hope no one will argue, that a Piece fuits any Place; and
without a Variety in the Manner of a Mafter, I cannot judge whether
he be a true one, or how rich his Thoughts are.
Secondly, Becaule the Artiff ought, in his Ordonnances, to comply
with the Fancy of the Preprietor, as far as Reafon and the Rules of
Art and Decorum permit.
As to the firft, common Nature thews him his Error. Do we not behold
Sun fhine and fine Weather with greater Pleafure and Attention after 2
Storm! And can it have aless Effect on our Senfes in a Picture? Theres
even no Country to defpicable, but in less than nine Miles Diftance it
will exhibit a new Prospect. How can it difpleafe a Painter fometimes
to reprefent fformy Weather, and then calm and delightful Sun fhine?
Since the great Unlikeness caules Variety, and this charms the Eyc.
Now, we fee a fhady Grove; then, a Wilderness; next, a repofed
Landskip, Coc. Great Waterfalls, huge Oaks, Rocks and the like
Objects, well handled, look allo very plealing in a Room. Thus we
might, as 1 may fay, thew the World in Epitome, and behold it at one
View.
If a Painter always follow one Manner, how often will he expofe
his Weakness and Incapacity? If it be Sunfhine, what Places will he
find to fait all his Pictures? Can he place them always in the Sun, in
order to thew their Naturalness? but granting the Work to be placed
in luch a Light, another Unhappinets will Hill artend it; for the Sun-
light will fall into the Pilture from a Side, and the real Sun fhine will
come upon it fronting.
From which Premifes tis apparent, that the common Light is not
only neceffary, but always the moll advantageous for Chamber-
pieces.
A good Painter ought to be prudent in the Difpolition and Choice
of his Work, carefully obferving the Nuture of the Place, that his
Art may not disjoin, but aid the Archicecture; making his Landships

(in order to lock like Nature) the further they are from the Light of the
Reem, so much lighter than those which are near it; for otherwife, they
will look but like Piftures.
The second Confideration (which is a great Addition to Ornament)
respelts the fellowing or matching the Pictures well; and tho' Matching.
pieces be very well known, yet many People entertain wrong Notions
about them. Their Opinions, touching what is necelfary in a Fellowing-
picture, are various: But they generally agree, that it confitts of an
Umformiry of Conception and Difposition of Objects, Colour and
Light: To which, fome add, that if one Landskip be a flat Country
the other ought to be the fame; if one be rocky, the other ought to
be to roo: In thort, they mult be to much alike, that, on coming to
gether, the one feems to be an Impreffion of the other; in both, c
qual Sky, equal By-ornaments, equal Filling; nay, to very equal, that
there mull not be a white Speck in the one, but the other muit have

My Belief is, that chefe Niceties are owing to the Wilfulness of
Arrifts, and that, in a Matching piffure, nothing more is requifire, than
an equal Point of Sight and Unifermity in the Figures, when it mut
bang at a like Height with the other. He who would join the reft of
the Particulars, feeks the fifth Wtheel on a Waggon; for why, affer
fatisfying my Curiofity in viewing a Colicary Wildernets, should 1 not
enjoy the Pleature of a pleafant Plain? Or a woody Landskip in Op
polinon to an agreeable Warer-view and a delightful Prospect? I think
the Word (Felfows; fufficiently implies, that they are two Pictures
of equal Size, alike framed, receiving the same Light, whether the
hang above of next each other, motly alike filled with Work, and the
Figures of equal Magnitude, and leffening towards the Peint of Sight.
And as for the Thoughts or Defign, the more different they are, the
more agreeable; and the better thewing the Richnets of the Mafters
and Ar-
Fancy. in a Word; a Landship suits bet with a Landskip,
cbitsiture with Archirefture; and more is not, in my Opinion, required
in well-fellowing a Picture.

C H A P. VIII. Of the Lights in a Landship.
L THO we have largely treated of the Lights in the prece-
(A ding Book, yet I find myself obligated to fay fomewhat about
it, with respect to Landskips; especially Frent-lights in Picces
which face Windows: This Point purzles many Painters; and not
without Caufe, fince tis a critical Proof of their Capacities.
The chief Reafon of this is, that Arcifts will not venture to under-
take any think that is unprecedented; and no one has Courage enough
to fet the Example. They plead a main Difficulty arifing from hence;
namely, that, having a Front-light, they cannot make Shades on the
Ground or Objects, but mult find their Effects going off and Force on-
ly by the darkeft Touches: s if the driving Clouds did not caule large
Ground-fhades; which daily Experience thews they do. In the next
Place, thefe Men tacitely confels their ignorance of the Force and Har-
mony of Colours, in chuling dark Objects againft light ones, and the
contrary; for, placing againtt an Offskip of green Trees, light colour-
ed Objects, fuch as Whice, Rofe-colour, light and frong Vellow, and
the like, you have so need of large Shades. Would you make Ob
jects againt a light coloured Building, let them be of dark Colours;
or, a Vafe of a warm and brown Colour, and againtt it, a lighter Ob-
ject again; and againtt the Offskip the foremoll Work, is made flrong
by the Diminution of the Tints; fince all that goes back or retires be-
comes darker and more dusky; as the Shades, on the contrary, grow
fainter and weaker the further they are off. Again, the Grounds
themfelves can afford us great Helps; one may be light Vellow, ano-
ther Green, another bluith, according to their Qualities, as we shall
further thew.
As to the Figures, they may have a fufficient and natural Side-ade
for fetting them off; for thofe, which are on the Side of the Piece,
which moft goes away from the Light, will receive much more Shade
than the middle ones; as allo a Ground-shade; becaute they go to much
aside from the Point of Sight, and the further, the more.
We conceive alfo, that if any Houles or other upright Works running
towards the Point of Sight were placed quite on the side, the one high
and the other low, as here, a Grotto with a Viflo, there again fome-
thing elfe with ruflicated Stone, or Ballultrades, Coc. and before them
Nn 2
a Water,

a Water, along the Extremity of which, some Vafes or Figures were
Standing on Pedeftals; thefe Objects, I fay, altho' they had no perfect
Shade, yer, with respect to the Light, would fuffice; and moreover,
throw Ground hades againlt each other: Which would give the whole
York a great Dicorum and Elegance.
If it be objected, that this Management would caufe too great a
Force on the Objects without the Piece; and make it look empty in the
middle, and the Eye of courfe be drawn too much to the Side; more-
over, the rce Corners of the Piece would then be too confining: I antwer,
that, if the Ordonnance be difpoted on fuch a Ground as aforelaid,
and the Coloars well chosen and ordered, the large Light in the middle
will be found the prongel, and the Side-work more close and compact;
and by ordering some Pedeftals with Vafes, here and there, againtt the
large and broad Shades of the Buildings, they would produce a fine
Ested.
Many dare not introduce any Ground thades on the Fore-ground, in
fuch a froming Light, in order to break a kctle that large Light, and
make it goot; alledging, tharthe Wall covers it, and thinking, that no
more Ground-thade can be feen on the Ground than that of the Wall:
But thefe Menare much mistaken; they sland and behold the Place, but
do not corfder what is built over their Heads; what high Stories, and
what large Ground skales thofe Tkings ought to cause on the Fore-ground

going of, which ther mult imagine to be feen without Doors above the
Opening of the Piece; for, tho' it fland againtt a plam Wall, yet it
attully reprefents an incire open Pannel in the Room, the Light where
of falls directly into it.
To be the better underffood in what I mean by (Objects without the
Pirce, or Out-works) 1 adl the following Demonfration in Plate
LI
in the Part A place a Point of Sight B, and draw from it two vifual
Lines C and D: Now all thar is without thote Lines, is without the
Piece E, and called Out-werfs, and may be suppoted to reprefent a con-
cinned Stone work united and jorned to the Wall F, whereby Shades
and Groundhades fall on the Ground; and all above it being Skj,
you can, as is faid, thew the Height of the House or Chimneys, by
1
Groundhades faurg into the Pillure.
Here it may be asked, whether the Figures in the middle (which on
this Occafion make the principal Light) ought not to be altogether, or
always the major Part of them, in the Shade? To which Lastwer, that
the Heught or Lowness of the House must govern in that Point; for, if it
be

be high, the Ground fhade will be longer; if low-roof’d, neither fo
long nor broad.
This Method, to far as it relates to Frenting-pieces, is as well founded
as helpful, and, tho' never prattifed, tis however not to be rejected:
Butno body will lead the Way, without feeing the Examples of others.
And yet, every Day, as we walk in Sun -thine, we may make this Obfer-
vation in Nature; the Sun thews us Examples enough. Moreover, tis
natural in viewing Things, rather to have the Sun behind than in our
Faces, and yet many reprefent the Sun-light behind in the Picture, and
not one does it fronting; as having no Knowledge of the Natures and
Effects of Colours, nor of making Lightness and Darknels againtt pro-
per Grounds, and, confequently, do not underfland due Harmony.
Pourtrait and Bats releif Painters dare venture to do it, and find to much
Advantage in it, as thereby beft to deceive the Eye; to their great
Honour.
If the Artiff think he can apprehend me better by an Example, I
will freely give him one. See Plate Ll. aforefaid
I place then, on the right side of the Piece, a Row of Houfes run
ning towards the Point of Sight. The firt is square, with a Step into
the Door-way; the Doorishalf hidden behind the Frame of the Piece,
and ornamented with two Pedeltals with Sphinses. Two or three Feet
orer the Doof is a fmall Moulding which fupports the Roof. Near this
Building flands another, rifing fomewhat higher; the Side-walling
whereof is plain, and in Front are a Door and Window. On each Side
of the Entrance flands a Pillar supporting the Entablature, and there-
on is a Compats (pandrel. Next this, are feen Rails running up to an
other Houle, which is higher then the firft, and lower than the fe-
cond. Ten or twelve Feet further off flands an bigh Wall, running cross
the Piece; and in this Wall, on the left Side of the Point of Sight, is
a large open Gate-way, thro' which we fee the Offskip.  Above this
Gate, on the right Side, appear the Tops of some large and high Trees,
which fill the Sky. In the middle of the Piece, we exhibit an oftan-
gular Stone, and, againft the Front-cant, a Watertrough. This Stone
is about 8 or to Feet high, and has, on Top, a Ball. On the left Side,
without the Piece, fland some Trees running towards the Point of Sight.
Now, obferve the Light (which, as has been intimated, falls into
the Piece fronting) and what Ground-sbades the Objects give each other,
and their Course with Respect to the Sun’s Height.
He now, who underllands Perspective, may cafily guels, what Shades
tuch Objects will give on the Ground, how large and long they will
be

be, os what they will fall, across, and runing towards the Point of
Sghe: Likewite, how much this Frone-light will exceed a Side-one,
in Brighiness as well as Colours. All Things parallel with the Herison
are intirely lighted by the San; and contrarily, those which are paralled
with the rifual Lines, are dark and without his Reach, and so exactly
timited, that the lead Projecture, even of an Inch or a Straw’s Breadih,
witreceive Light; as the Example thews.
As for the Ser-off or Harmony, no one will doubt whether it is less
to be found in a fronting Sun thine than a fide one; for, what is wanting
in Shade the Colours and Tints will doubly fupply.
This Sort of Light, how odd foever ir may teem to thofe who never
tried it, nevertheless affords many beautiful and advantageous Accidents
very pleating to the Eve; but I mult obferve, that the xider and larger
the Piece is, the more charming it becomes, than in a narrow and high
one; becaute, the more the Objects appreach the Point of Sight, the less
Stade they gice, and the further they go off fidewise from it, the broader
are the Sbades.
I did not propofe to favany Thing further about the Lights and their

Qyalnes; but in the Courfe of Wruing, fomething of Moment touch
ing them sill occurs to my Thoughts, which I think worthy of Ob
fervation, as being to uncommon, that I doubt whether any Inftance has
been before given of it; it is touching the Air or common Light falling
from on Figh thre an Opening into a round and close Temple, or any Place
of Retirement, rocky Reposstory for the Dead, Cec. I luppole the Open
ing as the Delign will permit. Now we have formerly thewed, that
common Light, contrary to that of the Sun, illuminates the Objects
with widening Rays; wherefore, all Things, going away from the
Center of the round Tempie, have longer and narrower Ground-udes;
as the nearer the laid Center, the porter; even to much, as if, flanding
julf under or upon that Center, they give not any Ground-shade at all,
except under Foot. On the contrary, it will be found, that fuch Ob-
jeltsreceive fronger Light from on high than thofe which go off fide
wife, and the further they go off, fill the less: Vet we perceive the
contrary in the Reflexions from the Ground. The more the Objects ap
proach the Center, the lighter they are in Reffexions, be the Ground
even Whire, or Blue, Red or Vellow, Light or Dark.
As for the Courfe of the Ground-Chades of the Objects, let them fland
where they will on the aforefaid Plan or Ground, they flow from the
Center or middle Point directly under the Light.

CHAP. IX. Of Landships in a small Compass.
E have formerly afferted, that Reprefentations in a small Com-
pass are necelfary as a general Rule for all Choices; which we
shall exemplify in Landskips on almoft the fame Balis as that of
Hifery; to wit, that there is a Difference between a Landskip in a fmall
Compass, and the contrary; and that the former is much more artful
and troublefome than the latter, tho' having lets Circumflances: To
which, we shall fubjoin the Requilites necellary to borh, in order to
make each in its Kind equally good; together with a Remark touch-
ing the By-ornaments.
As to Landskips in general, they are, as we have thewed, in the same
Caleas Hiftories; to wit, that a large Ordonnance in a fmall Compais,
carries more AArt, Knowledge and Elleem than the contrary; becaute
the Objects require more Work, and a more plain and dittinct Ex-
prestion of their Qualiries; which in fmall Objects, in a large Com-
pass, is not fo nicely requilite; for the nearer we approach the Objects,
the more fentible they become. As in Hifories, Variery of Thoughts
and Objects occur (for compoling Ordonnances, either imall or large,
with 2, 6, 20, go, even an 100 Figures) in Palaces, Halls, Galleries,.
Towns, Villages, in the Field and Woods, (5c. So in Landship offer
an intinity of Objects for making fine Views, both in small and large
Compass, fuch as Woods, Plains, Rocks, Wilderneffes, common.

well as the fatyric, mournful, joyful and merry. And tho' we could
order all the aforefaid Particulars into one Piece, yet they cannot pro-
duce fuch an Effect, in reference to Art, as each lingly will do; it be
ing certain, that Things feen from afar, as we have formerly obfer-
red, never fatisfy Curioficy fo well as thofe which are near; whereby
they become to us more diffinct, as well in their Exifience and Form
as Colour. We Know, that the more the Objects diminith and go
off from us, the more they abate of their Lirclenelles, not only in their
Superficies, but alfo in their Out lines and Sways. A Trees Body full
of Holes and Knots, appears fmooth and even at a Diftance; even.

Iis true, that a large and concife Landskip does not give general
9
imisfaction; yet we know, that an Affembly of few (out People of
Fa gm) will never break up without doing Buliness; when, con-
trarly, a Meeting of the Vulgar feldom does any thing without Con-
fution. Irs the fame in Mulick, with many Voices; they make a
great Noife, but never affect the Senfes like the single Voice of a fine
Toman, accompanied with the Basso centinue; which incirely charms
us, make us ligh, even fometimes thed Tears and this is only cauted
1. By the Force which les in a Sole, fupported by the Bass. 2. By
the Diltinctness of the Words tweerly utter’d; and lattly, by their
Senfe or Pattion: All which is not to be found in a great Concere;
becauie we cannor underfland the Words, much less the Sente, bur
fix our Attention on the general Harmony only. It is true, a great
Performance of Mufick will pleafe common Senfe, but an artful Sol
is for People of Judgment; the former does, in some meafure, af
feet the Body, but the latter rouches the Soul, and leaves lafting im-
Prefficus.
The principal Difference between small and great Landskips lies in
the Peint of Sight. in the Great in a small Compass, the Horizon is
commonly fomewhat low, and in the Small in a large Compass, high:
In one is a high Ground, in the other a Valley; the one is a natural
Reprefentation, and the other looks like a Map: The one keeps a good
Decorum, let it hang ever fo high, and every thing looks upright; in the
other all teings teem to be tumbling; and it appears well no longer than
while on the Eafil. In a great Landskip in a fmall Compats all is
ieen plain and diftinct; at leall one Part, according as the Choice is;
in the small in a large Compass we can perceive nothing perfectly but
the General; parly, becaute the great Light creates a Faintness, and
partly, becaule the Piece is viewed at a great Diltance, as hanging
commonly above other Paintings: Tis even a certain Maxim, that as
Pitures never hang below the Eye, unless in an Auction; to a Land
ship with an high Horizon, mult always needs be falfe. I leave the
contrary to any one's Judgment, how much more Decorum and Advan
tage it hes, when of fuch an Extent as to be placed high or low, ever
up to the Cieling, without Fear of being hung below the Eye, when
the other muft find its Comfort under its fer Height, without Hope
of ever gaining its Decorum, unlets by coming calually on the Ealel
again.

After having thown, that a great Landship in a small Compass,
with a low Horizon, can bear hanging above the Eye, and look be-
coming; and that a small one in a rarge Compass, becaute of the
high Horizon, lofes its true Quality, to the Detriment of the Paint
er; we conclude, that there is no better Method to be uled with a
Landship of large Extent, in order to make it becoming and natural,
chan to fet, as aforefaid, the Horizon fomewhat lower; fince fuch
Pieces are always placed above, I may fay far above, the Eyc.
But here, perhaps, a Difficulty may be ffarced; namely, that if the
Horizon be let to low, the Sky will over-power the Principals of the
Pilture: But in Antwer, let me ask, whether the Sky is to be look
ed on as an ufelets Parch? Does not the Sky moft adorn and invigo-
rate a Landskip, and make it look agreeable! Mult we suppofe the
Earth to excel the Heavens in Magnitude? Ay, But, fay they, there
is nothing to be seen in the Sty.—— But is a beautiful Sky tuch a
Triffe, and to eafily to be painted? Is it not more artful to reprefent
thin driving Clouds than a flat Ground, here and there an Hill or Plath
of Water, Grass or Herbs? A beautiful Sky is a Proof of a good
Malter; but if it feem too large, we have an Help for that Make
the Fore-ground fomewhat large, and then a Treeor tco, thick or thin-
leav’d, will take up enough of the Superfinicy, and break any thing
that is obttrulting. Likewife a Building may ferve, either fronting,
of in Profile; or, inflead of it, a Pyramid or Obelisk: Thefe, not to
be flung into the Offskip, according to ufual Practice, but brought on
the Fore-ground great and firong; letting the Tops of thote Objects ad
vance high, in order to fill, and thereby, as I have faid, in some mea-
fure, here and there to break the Sky. But, here it may be again ob-
jelted, that fuch larse Trees would not look fine, becaute their Leaf
ing cannot be feen : But is the Leafing of a Tree of more Value than
the Top of a beautiful Building, Pyramid, or any fuch uncommon Ob-
jell? Muft thefe give place, and be left out for the fake of a Tree?
Would it not look wonderful, and be a great Pity, that one in an hun-
dred should lofe its Leafing? Let one, two, or more Boughs fhoot forth;
there are enough without them. I fay then, that, by this means, the
Shy will be sufficiently filled, and the Difficulty removed. nd now
the Sky is moderated, and the greateft Force lies in the Landskip and
By-ornaments; the Fore ground is eleganrly embelliffied; the Offskip
broad and deep, with an Excent equar to my With; and the Hotizon
tich, as I need not fear the rumbling of the Objects.

When I peak of placing forwards, great Trees, elovated Buildings,

That then the Greand goes down bebinl, and rises forwards; fince they
cannot relith any thing they are not ufed to, and which requires the
Objects to be fomewhat more finithed and larger than in their common
Way: But altho' I have thus thewed the Preference of one Manner of
Painting before the other, yer 1 do not prefcribe it as a Law to be al.
wars followed. My Delign is only to illustrate what is fine in the one
abore the other.
CH AP. X. Of painting Reems with Landskips.
T HIN K this Point to be of Moment, and weighty enough to
be contidered with Attention; the rather, fince some Painters often
happen to fee different Management with respect to the Rules for
painting Halls, Parlours, Cc. and therefore cannot refolve on what is
molt fntable and advantageous for thofe Apartments; and when they
are to perform fomething therein, to many Difficulties arife, and their
Opinions fomuch vary, that they are at a sland whether they shall re-
prefent a Picture, or, a Painting in the Manner of Tapestry, or, Ny
ture itfelf.
As to the firl Sort, we muft be fenlible, that the Piltures, being
all of a Size, and placed orderly, will be taken, by the Knowing, for
abAratted Painings, breing no Relation to the Room; according to the
Notions of thofe, who, being Mafters of a good Collection, are indif
ferent where ther Pictures hang, whether againtt bare Walls or Hang
ings As to the fecond Sort, is certain, that Paintings, made in the
Manner of Tafefiries, will never be taken for real Iapeftries, be their
Borders ever to beautiful and elegant; and therefore have not the Ef.
feet which the Mafter purpofes. The third Sert, 2iz. to reprefent
Narure, is certainly the betl: For, what can be wanting, when the
Work is natural, artful and proper to the Place?
A Reprefentation of Tapeltry is a lame Picture. And a Picture,
not agreeing with Natare and the Place, is alfo deficient; wherefore
2 Mafter, who paints fuch, is unpardonable; becaufe, inftead of a
dorning the Room and preserving its Arcbiteffenic Order, he at once
Spoils bott.

I was one Time asked, whether any certain Rules, befides the Light
and Point of Sight, were neceltary for Hall-painting. I antwered, that
the Architecture ought to be observed throughout, as far as concerned the
Compartition and Ornaments; and that, whether painted or real, they
mult correfpond with the Deor, Mantle-piece and Alcore, and the whole
Work take its Proportion from one Order, that it may look proper,
and make up one compact Body. Now, if a Wall were to be covered
with a fingle Picture, it mult be handled in the Manner of an Hlang-
ing: But a Picture is fomewhat more brittle than a Tapetiry, and
fooner damaged by hanging to low. Chairs mull not be fet againtt
it; if it get Hure or Dents, they are not eafily repaired; a Surbafe is
much better; and belides, the Wall is fomerimes to long, that it can-
not well be feen at one View. Wherefore, when the Dillance is too
imall, it is better to divide the Wall, and to ufe more than one Point
of Sight.
If now there be a Door in the middle, or on each Side, they ought
to be left free, tho' they are without Mouldings, and even with the
Cloth; for the Room mult have at leaff one Pallage: But not painted
over, according to the Practice of some, with Trees, Hills, or Stone-
work, as if it were not there: A very common Error, and which no
Mafter will jultify, unlets he have a greater Eye to Preft, than the
general Elegance of the Werk. Wherefore tis more advitable to enrich
the Deor or Doors with fine Mouldings or Ornaments, If the Deor
happen to come in the middle, a beautrful Frontispiece; adorned with
Carving, will look magnificent: This, in order to fave Buildingchar
ges, might alfo be reprefented on Cloth; yer some Artifis, who are not
uted to it, will not eafily be induced to undertake ir, but rather to
much more Landskip; tho' on due Confideration, and for the lake of
Decorum and Naturalness, they had better call in the Affiftance of an
other Hand for their Help. When now there happens to be a Door,
but not in the middle, it will be proper, for obtaining Regularity, to
order alfo one on the other side; unless it be even with the Wall,
and the Moulding of the Surbafe run cross it; in which Cafe, you may
make fomething or other on its upper Part, fuiring with the Land
ship, fuch as a Stone with Batsrelief either diffant or near. I lay
jou may do fo; but for my Part, I should not much like it: Where-
fore my Opinion is, that two Doors are much better than none; and
tho' you might neverthelels incline to the laff Propofal, in order thus
to have a larger Piece, yet Tis inconfiffent, fince the Cieling muft
have its Support according to its. Comparement Under each Suim

mer ought to be fomething, either a Pilafter or Term, or elfe the
Piece mst bave a circular Head. But Rooms are feldom to ordered;
perhaps, becaute fome Men love to engross all the Gain to themfelves,
exclutive of the Affictance of others; and were some permitted to do
as they pleale, they would paint over every thing, with Flowers, Fruit
or Ejfory; an Architecture painter, every where Mouldings. They
may, even in Time, go fuch Lengths, that could the Floor be paint-
ed as well as the Cieling, we should fee, in every Stone, either a
Flower-por, Viilo, or an Hinery, as fomerimes we fee it in lron
Chets.
I fay then, that an Arciit, tho' the whole Work be undertaken by
him only, muit not incroduce more of his particular Branch into it,
than Reafon and Decorum require; taking the Affictance of a Friend
in tuch Parts, if there be any, as he has not tiudied; for Variety re.
frethes the Eye. I think an Hall or Room, with one Sort of Pittures,
like a Shop wherein are fold but one Sort of Goods. To give an in
ftance, ler us suppofe a Room, with a Side-wall, go Feet long, divid
ed into three Pannels; and the Surbafe round the Room and the Pi
lafters between the Pannels, to be either of Painting or Wood, as 1
find it proper; and ever the Chimney I propese a Piece with Figures. I.
tho' a Landskip painter, undertake the whole Work; but, not being
able to manage the Chimney-piece, defire the Affiftance of a Figure
painter; becaute a generous Painter, if he expect Praife and Honour,
mult not so mach regard his Gain as the Decoram of the Room; a Cloth
of or 6 Feet, more or less, in fixh a grand Undertaking, is but a
Triffe; ler another Hand get fomething by it, if it tend but to the Or
nament of the Work. Iorder a Figure-piece over the Chimney; be.
caute tis the principal Place of the Room; for, what Buliness can 2
Landship have there, the Herison whereof ought to be without, naj,
much lower than the Pirture! Wherefore in to principal a Place nothing
would be seen but Sky.
We are very fentible, that if, in fuch a Room, we reprefent Na-
ture, we cannot introduce, into one Pannel, a Morning; into the fe
cond, a Ahid day, and into the third, an Evening, nor wfe various Cour
rries; all mult have one and the fame ir. We grant, that, were
the Room comparted into four Pannels, we could exhibit the sour
Cardinal Poists, or the four Seafons, provided each Fiece had a parti
Tuler Point of Sight.
As for the Difficulty of the left and right Light, to which the Side
pieces mull needs be subjett, and the Light falling on the Wall fronting.

from the Windews, we have fufficiently fpoken of it, in the Book of
Lights and Shades.
And now, if throughout, we fee a continued or natural Landship, the
ir alike, and the Leafing of the Trees running from one into the other
when they are extenfive enough, I imagine the Painting mult look well,
and Nature and Art be fully facished. If I am not followed by every
body, I am fufficiently honoured by doing Juffice to Art and the Cu-
rious.
CHAP. XL. Of ornamental Painting without deers.
FT ER having treated of Room-painting with Landskip, I
a I think this the fircelt Place to (peak of ornamental Painting with-
out-doors. This Point is very ufeful for two Realons; firft, be-
caule by certain Paintings, adapted to Places, we difcover what Sort
of Places they are, and what Ufes put to. Secondly, becaute it will
be of Service to Arcifts frequently concerned in painting Viftos, Foli-
afe, and other Things withourdoors, in leading them to further
Thoughts.
I think it moft proper to ornament Summor-houfes (which are at the
Ends of Walks, and ufually benched) with Grottes, set of with Fi-
gures and Fountains; bur shallow and Side Jummer-Houfeslook beft with
Bassreliefs of a darkith Colour. In Houses of Pleafure, for Drink-
ing, Talk or other Amufements, fuit Grottes, Fountains, Figures, Urns,
and Pases. The Ends of Galleries become Architeftonic Views, and
the Piers between the Windows, Niches atth Fifures and Bassreliefs,
according to the Thickness of the Wall. in Gateways, having Rooms
on each Side, Figures and Bassreliefs are proper; as alfo fine Archi-
tetture, fet of with Terms and other fuch Things: yet on the Sides
and Sofitas of Windows ought to be Foliage only.
But, to return to the Summer-bouse-Painting, we mult confider, that
as the Kinds are various, to there fuit to each, particular Reprefenta-
tions as will in Defign as Colours, according to the different Lights.

If the Building be square, and have the Opening in the middle; and
the Painting exhibic a Bass-relief, the Light ought to be frenting; but
if it be cdole roafed, the Light muft come more from below. Again, it
this Building be desg, or the Opening, which gives if Light far from
the Wall, it ought to be lighted mesity from the Reffexion of the Ground;
ICl..

yet, if the Cpening be wide, the Light may proceed someribat from
the Sik: But contrarily, when the Summerhoufe is shallow, or
the Opening near, and one Part of the Painting is in the Light, and
the other in Shade, its own natural Reffexion mut be seen in the sbady
Part, that the Work may look like a real garred Bassrelief: And,
becaute no Tendernels or Pleafaniness can be ufed in it, as being
in Sback; I think the Parts there ought to be handled, fomewhar
more large and rong, I mean, with few Littleneses, in order to make
them cor ex, and for preventing Confulion, that at a further Di
Rance the Work may look becoming. Thus much as to Light.
The Coloars in this Cafe, if well chosen and put together, add no
small Ludre; of thefe, I think the three folloxing Sorts the molt pro-
per, namely, Free, fore, blue Stone and chite Mharble, by reafon of the
Grcens of the Bulding, which cover ir, and commonly Bade the
Pining, and impart to it more or lets of their Colour: Which, how.
ever, looks lovely and fweet, especially upon the Whirs. The twoo-
thers, Blus and Free, fone, may be used for By-works; fince Purple, Vi
olet or Red cannot have here a proper Place, by reafon of the dif
cordunt Green, producing an inharmoniou; Mixture. But, if a ckan
Light fall on the Painting, without being shaded, then the three laft
named Colours appear well, as does alfo a Fleh-colour, and have, with
the Green, a good Effet, as being, by means of it, improved: And
the Green thereby becomes beautiful and lively; especially when pla-
ced between Blue fione Ornaments, which every where unite with
the Green, and keep together. But in this Management let me be
underffood to fuppofe the Summer houle to be wide; where what has
been faid is, on each Side, next the Opening without, painted on
Boards, giving little of no Shade.
In the Painting ought alfo to be confidered its Shape, whether cir-
cular, square, offanguler, oral, or any other, which will beft fuit
there.
As for the Subjects or Designs, they mult be governed by the Sity-
ation of the Place. Flowers are facred to Flora; the Spring, to Veaus;
Fruits, to Pomona; Fines, to Bacchus; Herbs, to Iiculapius; Corn,
to Ceres; Musck, to Rpollo, who is alse the Parent of the Seasons;
Procreation, to Priapus; and Fruitfulness, to Diana: From thele Heads
may be drawn Abundance of Matter for the Ornament of Summer
houles.
Now, to be more plain in what I have before afferted, I shall ex
hibit two Examples.
For


f Landskips.

Chap. II.
For the one, 1 place Zephyras and Florg in the middle of a square
or round Piece, as occalion requires; thefe are both feen fronting, my-
cually embracing in a lovely Manner. He, fitting on her right
Side, has his lett Arm about her Neck, with his right Hand holding
hers, which refls on his Knee, and the peaking to him very friendly
and lovingly, almoll Mouth to Mouth. Her Head inclines over the
right Shoulder. Wich her left Hand the is taking up a Wreath out of
a Basket of Flowers. Her Lap (ways to the left, and his to the right;
and between them are fitting one or two Cupids twilling a Garland
about a fiaming Torch. He is almofl naked and winged, having a
Trumper lying by him. She is airily and finely dreft.
The other Example confifts of three Figures, and exhibits Florg on
the right Side, Pomony on the left, and Apollo in the middle, touching
his Lyre, and firring fomewhat above the two others. Flora has a
Corne Copie full of Flowers, and Pomonas is filled with Fruits, and
the holding a Pruning-Knife. Apollo fits fronting. Fforg looks forward,
with a Finger on her Mouth; and Pamona, as in Surprize, tolfes her
Head backwards and fideways. Thefe Goddeffes fit in Profile againtt
each other. The By-ornaments, round about, confift of Childrenor
Capids.
Such Defigns as thefe, especially the former, are moft proper in
Flower-gardens; but where there are moy Fruits, Pomong takes place.
Here you mult oblerve, that I order thefe two Compolitions for Bass-
reliefs, fomewhat more than half rising, and lighted fronting; but when
the Light comes from a Side, they ought to be very faint, or little re-
lered; as we shall further illuftrare in the Book of Statuary, treating
of the three Sorts of Bass-reliefs.
in Flower-gardens fuit bed diffant Vizes, or Groves; contrarily, in
Walks with Trees, the Ornaments should be Rivers, Sea-bavens with
Hills, Buildings, Rocks, and fuch like; as they are not shaded by Trees,
bit receive a pure and open Light. Vet in Summer-houfes and Places for
Rql, which are fomewhat thaded by the Greens, Viffes are not proper,
but rather Bass-reliefs, contilting of one, two or three Grounds.
On the Court-yard Walls, between the Houle and Garden, fuit alfo
fuint Bass-refiess of one or other of the colour’d Stones aforelaid; like-
wile Terms, Urns and Vafes with Greens, in cale no natural ones be
there; or elle, Fountains, with their Water-falls. Againt a green
Hedge or Wall fuit well circular Hellows, with Bufts in them, if alto
thereabout fland no natural ones. Thefe Bults may be painted of wbite
or light Red Marble, or other light-coloured Sione.

The Plaes before -mentioned are the principal and moff common,
bit feldom happen to be together; yet if they should, the Methods
aforefaid will be of uic, and you may enrich your Thoughts by their
means; tince they are laid down as well for Hints as Examples: And
if vou allo confult the fine Deligns of le Patre, you will never be at
2 Gard. But, the better to aid the Conceptions of a young Mafter,
I willngly fibjon another Ordonnance of my own Invention, as
follows
I place Txrs in the middle of the Piece, fitring quite naked between
Povins and Flera; this latter flands on her right side, crowning her
with 2 Chaplet of Flowers; and Pomond, on her left, offers Her a
D
Branch of Peanes; which Jenas receives with her left Hand, who,
tisting high and almok Rrair, maincains a fine Air and charming De-
portment; and this by her Tripliciry affording an agreeable Har.
mony of Barky, Smell and Tagre, (for here, Beauty implies Sight)
and if the Place be higher than broad, you may join Apotto to their
Company, fomewhat off and fainter, fitting playing on a Cloud; and
thus you may, in the moft proper Manner, exhibic the five Senfes.
However, Apelo is not to abfolurely necelfary here, fince Venus, or
Beauty, alfo implies Harmony; but I bring in Pomong, becaute Fruits
and Flowers generally go together; for Flowers grow and appear all
the Vear round, as well as the Frusts in Summer and Autumn. There
are allo Fruits which bloffom at the fame Time as the Flowers do,
to wit, Peaches, Apricots, Almonds, Cer.
in a Pimfical and Kirchingarden, I would place Esculapins, the Son
of Spells, God of Phyfic, as the Principal of the Piece, and to whom the
Gardenis facred, flanding in the middle between Apolle and Diamy; the
one, with his Quiver at his Back, fits on his right Hland, or near him, hold
ing a Sceptre topp’d with a Sun, or elle a Hlaming Torch; and the o
ther, on his left, adorned with a Moon, either on her Head or in her
Hand, and equipp’d with her Bow and Arrows. A sculapins holds a
Staff rwined with a Serpent.
The Moen, or Earth, caules the Seed to rot; which Apolls, or the
Sun, by his warming and fearching inflvence, caules to rife. As to
Phifical Herbs, three firtues are alcribed to them; warming and coot
ing, and a Nixture of both. Thefe may be appolitely reprefented by
the aforefaid three Perfons; fince, by Asculuprus, with his Staff twin
ed with a Serpent, is underflood Prudence, in moderating one Herb
by another, and by Art to make them work their Effects.

Having thus largely handled this Point, I shall confirm it by fome
figural Examples respecting what has been before faid, in order to thew
what Sort of Paintings and Ornaments are moft proper in fuch Places
where we ufually reprefent any thing, and which mult govern a
careful Mafter, in order to make his Deligns conformable thereto.
Obferve then, beginning with the firff Skerch, what I shall further
127.
1. If the Proprietor be defirous of having the Place painted all
round, what Sort will be the moft proper; Colours or Bass-relief.
2. What Obfractions may be there, to hinder the Nacuralness of the
Work in some Deligns.
3. At what Diffance it ought to be feen either from without or
within; fince it muft be executed boldly or neat accordingly.
4. Whether the Painting is to remain there conflantly Winter and
Summer.
Yow fee then, in the firtt Example of Plare LII, a Place inclofed by
two Side walls, at the End of which is a Summer-house equal to the
whole Breadth; the Entrance into it is in the middle, and on each
Side is an Opening, through which, the Reprefentations of A and B.
the one on the right and the other on the left, receive their Light; as
the middle Piece C has it fronting.
Over the Summerhoule and
Wall appear the Tops of the Hindbuildings D. Now the Quettion is,
what Subject is proper for C, a Villo or a Balsrelief? a green Pro-
Spett, such as a woody Country, of Flower-garden, would have no good
Efielt in this green Summer-house, when feen from without, where it
ought to be viewed; becaufe a Mixture of Green with Green affords
nerther Variety nor Delight. A Sea-baven, or a Court, adorned with
Statues, Fountains, Cafcades and fuch like Elegancies, would appear
exceedingly fine, vieiwed from within (for thole Colours look well among
the Green) but feen at its proper Diftance without, they will be found to
be falfe and contrary to Nature, by reafon of the Tops of the Houses D.
which, being behind, and rifing above them, difcover a general Step-
page: Whence it follows, that nothing is more proper for the Middle-
piece, than a Bass-relief.
Let us now confider what is beft for the two Side-pieces seen from
within; the one, as faid, recieving its Light from the left, and the o-
ther from the right. A Bass-relief cannot, in my Opinion, be deco
jous there, becaute the Eye) mult not be to clofely confined. They
ought to be Viffes, as not having the inconvenience which attends
the middle Piece, to hinder their Naturalnets: The Summer-poute be-

ing roofed in, the Light therefore falls more advantageous on thefe
two Places than the middle one, as being without the Glare of it:
Wherefore, Viffes mult be beft there; and even the fainter and blser,
the bewer, as before intimated. An Hoven with Shipping, a Court
with Fountains, Ilands with Hills, a Street-view of fine Buildings,
Temples and Galleries, together with a blue Ofship, &cc. Thele are
very delightful Objects, and produce, between the Greens, a Variety
and Decorsm: Now, we ought to obferve that the two Pieces A and B.
tho' they receive their Light from the Place, yet, if we plcafe, may
be lighted etterwise; becaute they are Without-deer-Prospetts, having
o Communication with this Within door Place as the Bats-relief has,
which is confined to it. Thus much as to that side; the fame Obfer.
vations are proper for the Sides E and F.
The fecond Example, in Plare Lll aforefaid, exhibits a Garden
with Parterres, alfo walled in. In the middle is a Gate of letticed
Work; and, on each Side, a shallow letticed Seat covered over with
Greens, noted A and B. In the Back of each Seat is a circutar Re.
presentation; and over them appear the Tops of Irees, as of a large
Orchard, marked C. Now let us confider, what Subjects will be mott
proper for the Seat A and B. Firft then, obferve the Diftance whence
the Work is to be feen, which is from without, on the Nearfide of
the Parterres. Here, as in the preceding Example, Viffes are not
proper; and, becaute the Place is to full of Green, more Green would
not look well: Wherefore, balf-raifed Bass-reliefs would be beft. As
for the Cclear we have before prefcribed it. The Sides may allo be
afforned as before in the laff Example, oblerving what Objects rife be.

ther a green Wall
Behold now, a third Sketch in Plate Lill difcovering a Walk with
Trees; at the End of which flands the painted Object A. Herein you
have great Liberty, and may ule your Pleafure; fince the Defign flands
free from any Obftruction. This only is to be noted in it, that, be
caute Tisalong Walk, and, in Nature itfelf we are oftentimes tired with
travelling fuxh an one, we have no Occation to make it longer by Perspect-
ive and other Views, tur rather slop the Walker by a fine Prospett, and in
wite him to a little Contemplation and Refl, that he may afterwards the
better go forward: Wherefore, we bere fuppofe, a beautifiul Imagery,
Fountamlike, of white Marble, placed in a Grotto or Niche arched
with Green, and therein painted, in full Proportion, and with all

Leveral Holes difcovering the Sky, Cadmas killing the Dragon; or, a
Diana with ber Nymphs; of a Term or Faunns accompanied by Baccha-
nals and Satyrs, with their Inftraments, some of which spest Water; or
elle you may exhibic a skeping Silenus, with the Nymph Egle squeezing
Mulberries on his Face. All thefe are proper Subjects for the Place,
and fuitable to the Occation.
You may alfo paint fome Terms on Boards cut away, and place them
againtl a green Wall en both Sides of the Niches, Windows, or circu-
lar Hollows; wherein may be fet Bults or Calls, as you fee in the fe-
cond Example, of fuch Colours as before-mentioned, and which ap-

CH A P. KIl. Tables or Ordennances of Venus and Adonis, for
the Embellissment of Landskips.
 91I A T I may conceal nothing from the Arcills, but as much as
poftible rouze and enrich their Genins, I have pitch’d on this sub
ject for the Ornament of Landskips. And tho' it be common,
yet I question whether it was ever handled in fuch a Manner. Idr
vide it into three Ordonnances.
The firtt is, Venus's making Love to him.
The second, His taking leave of ber, to go a Hanting; or ratber to.
be killed. And
The third, Her finding him dead.
The Fable is this. Venus was, according to the Poets, very much
enamoured with the Vouth Idenis, notwichflanding his Celdnels and
infentibility: And yet he refrained not from Kiffing and careffing her
for a Seafon; which much incented Mars, and raifed his Jealouty and
Rage, as often as he law the Vouth in her Lap.
Tbe first Ordennance.

very thing that can delight the Eye, Woods, Hhills, Valleys, Rivers,

in the middle of the Piece. Between it and the left Side, on an Hil.
lock, I place the Goddess and her Spark, attended by the three Graces,
who are to adorn her; one of thefe is twitling a Wreath of Flowers,
another is crowning her with a Chaplet of them, and the third is
bringing a Basker of Fruir. Some Capids are toying about her; one
elpecially is fitting ar her Feet, blowing Adoniss Horn: At whom he
fmiles; when fenus, with her Arm about his Neck, with her Hand
preites hs againtt her Breaft, or kiffes it. Behind the aforefaid Hil.
lock, againtl the Offskip, I place some thick-leaved Trees; the high-
eit in the middle of the Piece, and thofe to the left fomewhat lower
and thinser. Behind them we difcover the Remains of a Colonade,
riting and appearing half behind the Hillock, and running towards the
Point of Sight. On the fame Side forwards, I fet a cross low Wall,
which the Hillick fems. Againtt this Wall, which is but z or y
Feet and an half in Rife, 1 place a Water-god fitting alleep by his
Vafe, and encompaffed with Greens: And in the Corner, againt the
Frame of the Piece, I place a large Willow-free or one and an half
And thus half the Piece is filled. On the right side forwards, I
plant a Knobby moffy Body of a Tree about 6 or 7 Feet high; and
clofe behind it, a large and beautiful one fully leaved. Somewhat be
youd appears an high (quare Pedeftal, whereon flands a large and ele-
gant Vafe. Thefe Objects are in a Line running towards the Point of
Dight, making a Way between it and the Hillock, which is wide for
wards, and diminithing at the End of the Fore-ground, where the fe-
cond begins and runs out into an open Field; whence to the Horizon
are feen some faint Hills.
Let us now come forward again. In the Right fide Corner, Enry
Kindles the Fire of War; the is flying with a broken flinking Pitch

the Fable; for Ovid does not meation, that Adonis was killed by
Mers, with a Sword, but by a wild Boar, thro' his Infligation.

in the mean time, I doubt not but this my Sketch and Dispofition
will feem Rrange: Nevertheless, if well executed, it will certainly
appear fine with the Pedeftal, low Wall and Colonade; fince such
Things creace great Decorum and Variety in a Landskip.
The Light, 1 affiga, is bright Sun thine.
My Intention here is, to reprefent the Month of May, or the
Spring, when every thing is coming forth and bloffoming; tho' I am
very fentible, that the Green of the Trees, by the Diverfity of Co-
lour, is, in the Summer, more Painter-like; however this mult not
be like a Summer; belides, the Ifland of Cyprus is not like Helland, or
other cold Countries,, where the Greens come up late; for otherwife,
I should not introduce a Basket of Fruit.
Now, if it be asked, becaufe 1 sill fet, on the large Pedeftal, a
Vale, and that directly againtt the Hillock, where Venus and Adonis
are with the Graces, whether this would not throw a very large
Ground-fhade over thofe Figures! I fay, it would not; becaute 1 af-
fign the Sun a Meridian Alrude. Moreover, I do not fet the Pede-
Ral to near the Hillock as to be any Obftacle to the Figures. The
foremoll Tree, becaute it rifes to high, can alfo as littie prejudice
them, its Ground-hade paffing by them, over the Willow in the Cor-
ner, or at leaft a Part of it; which makes the Colonade, againtt
which it preads, fall back, tho' the Trees behind the Hillock can
fufficiently effect the fame; fince I make them either dark Green, or
elfe in Shade, and the little Leating hanging over the Lovers, in the
Light; in order thus to have below, tome Darkness for fetting off
the Lovers: My Incention being to place that Group directly in the
Jun, in order to have there the principal Light.
But here I may be reproved, on a Suppolition that 1 alt counter to
my own Polition; namely, that in Sun-shine, People do not sland talk-
ing, without sbading their Eyes: Which I do not deny; but let it be
confidered, that the Gods are not fubject to human Frailties, and
therefore they can look againtt the Sun: And to folve the Difficulty
with respect to Adonis, who is not a God, I make his upper Parts in.

Graces.

preffes her Breaft; and therefore the mull needs take Part of the same
Shade? To which, I anfwer, That there are Means enough, by one

Thing or other, to find that Shade. And as for Venss, the may be to
dispoted, either a litile backward or forward, as to receive Light e-
nough. Now, that Alars and Eary, at the Stone-work, may not
draw the Eye too much from the Principals, by making them in the
Light, I bring not much Sun into that Quarter; I mean that 1 fet
the foremoff whole Seem of the Tree, and a great Part of the hind
mofl, with Part of Mars, in a Ground Chade, occafioned by fomething
wirboat the Piece; and to let that Shade run, on the Fore-ground, jutt
to the low Wall breaking the Relidue here and there fomewhar
with Buthes and Shrubs: I might alfo place there a Priapus-term, of
other Object, in order a lictle to fill that Corner.
We have before faid, that neither ffoufes nor Temples muft enter the
Composition. Why not they, fay fome, as well as the Terml To which1
antwer, that the Fable makes no mention of any fuch Objects: And
let me ask, who should live in the Houfes! lis not faid, that Adonis,
tho' a Man, had any Houthold, or that he worshipped in a Temple.
This Piece may be richly embellished with ten or twelve Figures,
tho' Afars and Enny are but partly Figures. Some Landskip-paint
ers may poffibly object againtl fo great a Number, for that, thote,
well execuced, would better become an Hiffery than a Landskip: But
the Aniwer is ealy; the Figures are fmall, and the Landship,
large
We shall now proceed to the Colours and Aftions of the Figures.
We reprefent tenas in her Linnen, yet with her Opper-parts and
Legs almoft bare; under her, on the Grass, appears Part of a light
Red Garment.
Adonis's Garment is greenith Blue or dark Violet.
The two Groces, standing next to Venys, are drest in light coloured
Garments of changeable Sruff and broken Colours, preferving, about
that Group, a great Mats of Light: For which Reafon, I chule fich
Colours, as do not caute any unteemly Reffexions in the Carnation
of Venss or Adonis. Her Garment, who is crowning Veus with a
Chaplet, is Rofecolour; a second, more forward, and with one Knee
bent, is in Whire, and has a Flower in her Hand; and the third hav-
ing the Fruits, and flanding on the left Side, and fomewhat higher
on the Hillock, has an furera or Straw-coloured Garment. We need
not fay much about Mars and Envy; fince Cafar Ripa relates enough
conching them. Nothing is more proper for Mers, than a rulty Fil.
lemot of blood colour’d Coat; and for Exny, than a black one.

As for the Motions of Venus and Adonis, they are fronting in both;
but their Feet more or lets turned to the Light.
donis, on the right Side inclines his Upper-parts towards Venys,
with his right Hand on her Breaft, and his right Shoulder coming for-
wards; his Under-parts are fronting, and his left Leg excended, and
his right drawn in, as if he were about to rife; his Face froncing in
clines a little over his Shoulder to the Child who blows the Horn.
Contrarily, Venus, relling on her right Thigh, applies, in some mea-
fure, both her Knees to his extended Leg; her Face, in Profile, turn-
ed cowards him, fronts the Sun; her Breaft is alfo feen fronting;
the draws back her left Elbow, in order to prets his Hand on her
Brealt.
On due Confideration, thefe two Figures will be found to have 2.
natural and ealy Contraft or Oppofition, in Motion; fince I have en-
deavoured to give myfelf full Satisfaction touching all the Actions
exhibired, before 1 fet the Layman.
But, I mult return again to the Ordonnance. I forgot to place two
Children behind the foremoft low Wall; of whom, the one is leaning
over it, and, with a Finger on his Mouth, and Head funk, is thew-
ing the other the fleeping River-god. I place them there, firft,
for Decorums Sake; and fecondly, in order to break, in some mea-
fure, that long and fliff Piece of Stone-work. The Watergod is of a
brownith Vellow Hue, almofl as dark as the faid Stone-work; and for
two Reafons; firil, for the Sake of Repofe; and secondly, to prevent
a Mass of Light there with the Children, to the Detriment of the
Principal: Belides a further Purpofe; to adorn the Pedeltal of the Vafe
with a Balsrelief, reprefenting a Bacchanol or dancing Nymphs; and.
tho' it come in Shade, yet 1 affign it frong Reffexions. There ought
allo to beadded, one of two Dogs afleep; of which, the one awak
ing, ftares back with prick’d up Ears, at the Sound of the Horn.
I have before faid, that one of the Graces should be dreffed in Whire;
but now, I caff a beautiful blue Veil over it, as proper to break the
Srength of the White.
A Piece, thus executed, is fufficient for the Production of many
others; especially, if we duely confider, how many Things are obter-
red in it, which by few is taken notice of, 2iz. the Qualiry of each
Figure, iis Origin or emblematic Signification, Coc. Many Fictions
are painted from the Poefs Dekcription, but few People weigh the Writ-
ors Meaning, tho' attended with an Explanation; which however is

Khnown to the Writer; as, the Shapes, Dreffes, Colours, Paffions and other
Remarkables: II hence wemay conclude, what mult be the Cafe of thofe
Men who do not make themfelves Mafters of all thefe Things; and
how eafily they may miftake, even pervert the Senfe of the Writer or
Poec. If the Fact lay in the Spring, they reprefent it in Summer; if
in a Winter-morning, they exhibit an Aurumn-evening: Ought the O.
pening to be a folicary Place, or Wilderness, they will incroduce Di.
vertions: Should any Perfon have a red Drapery, as proper to him,
is made blue, yellow, Coc. We grant, that the Fable may be re.
prefented plain enough; and, who the Charaffers are, and wrat they
are doing, prefently conceived; but the Drift of it is wanting.
Iis unnecellary to enlarge on this Table or Ordonnance further than
to oblerve, that Mars here figaines Vengeance; Adonis, the Winter
and Jenss, the Spring; which is the Realon, why thefe two latt can-
not agrec.
The Poets wrife, that there were four who went under the Name of
Fenus. The firlt was the Daughter of Calum and the Day. The fe
cond was brought forth of the Frorb of the Sea, being conceived in a
Morber of Pearl, and conduted to Cypras by the airy Eepbyrs: Ii
was the who bore Capid to Afercury. The third was the Daughter
of Tupiter and Dione, who was wedded to Valcan, Chief of the
Cuckolds; and the fourth was the Syrian, called Aftarte, who courted
the Love of Adonis, and to whom Solemon erected Allars to pleafure
his Concubines. Whence we may judge, what great Dilparity there
is between thefe fenuss.
Asfor the wild Bear, it implies the Night, lgnorance, Impiety, Fil.
sbiness, Lewdness, &cc.
The second Ordonnance: Or, Sequel of the foregoing Story.
When Adonis was now tired with Kiffing and Flattery, or, to fay
better, when his forrowful Fate drew near, and the Dogs fcenting the
Boar, fet up a Cry, he, deaf to Venur's Intreaties, wretted from her
Embraces, and jumped up eager for Sport.
We muft previoully underfland, that we are obliged to confine our
felves to two principal Points; namely, the general Disposstion, and the
Ligbt. And tho' on a due Confideration, it may poffibly feem to be
cholenless advantageous, than if it were a fingle Piece (which I willing.
ly allow) yet as it now ferves to motch anotber, it therefore requires
the same Light, tho'a revers’d one might better become it; becaute
then

then I should be at greater Liberty : But even then, the Dispesstion
would not be different enough from the former.
We have, in the Book of Ordennance, thewed, that when two Pieces
hang together, they ought to have a certain Conformity; efoecially
Landships with small Figures: As if, for inftance, the heaviell. Work.
be in the one on the right Side, and the Viftoon the left, in the other
or Matching-piece it mult be contrary; and yet, notwithflanding that
Neceffity or Rule, which however fublifts, I find fomething which gives
me greater Satisfaction, and better expreffes the Seafe; as may appear
in the Sequel.
I place, as in the preceding Ordonnance, the Point of Sight in the
Middle of the Piece, and on the right side an Eminence, alcended by
3 or 4 Steps, fronming or parallel with the Horizon. Upon it, at the
End againl the Oftship, I reprefent an open Niche, almoll (quare and
Compals headed, adorned, on both sides, with Pilaffers, fupporting 2
mall, but elegant Cornice, here and there fomewhat broken. About
the Niche hang Feltoons of Poppies, which are fatten’d to the Crown
of the Niche, and being buttoned up on each Side, their Ends en-
twined hang down together. Thro' this Niche, having a Seat before
it, we difcover an agreeable View of Woods, Lawns, Rivers, Roads,
Co. This Eminence takes up a third Part of the Piece, running off
keep on the inner Side. Forwards, againtt the Steps, which are moff=
ly in Shade by Trees without the Picce, to the Corner whereon flands
the Goddels, we place her gilt Chariot drawn by two Pidgeons.
On the left Side, between the Point of Sight and the Frame of the
Piece, fland 3 or 4 great and beauriful Trees, in a Row, running from
the Fore-part of the Piece, and by the Hillock towards the Point of
Sight. In the Corner, behind the Eminence, rifes an high and rough
Rock, alfo running towards the fame Point, making between both a
parrow Pallage, which forwards is over run with Buthes and Gorfe, and
behind is bare, to as to ditcover, through it, the Oftskip and End of
the Rock. Forwards in the Rock, I make a large craggy Hollow,
into which the Warer falls with imperuoficy. Thus much mottly as to
the Fore-ground. At the End of it runs a narrow croffing River,
from the Eminence to the back Part of the Rock; along the side
whereof, I thew a Plantation of high Trees, in order to make the Off-
ship, which is feen through them, appear as in a Valley. On the Le-
vel whereon fands Adoms, I fet, between two Trees, a white Marble
Balis, with a broken Term, and its Trunklying near it.

Corner, flooping; her under Parts almofl fronting, and her upper Parts
turned Sideways towards him; preffing her folded Hands, with the El.
bows forwards againft her Body, and linking her Head, looks from him
towards Heaven. I place one of the Graces by her Side as coming
down, embracing the Goddets about the Waiff with Fear and Con-
cern, and, with Amazement, looking to the left after Adonis. The
other Virgin, who run after him, is now with one Knee on the Ground,
with her lefe Hland shewing him the Goddefs, and with her right Hand
holding a Skirt of his Coat; to that the is moff feen from behind.
The third has, as is faid, her Hands frecched on high; and her Face
is fvelled by the Violence of her Outirys. Adonis, as in great Halle,
advances his right Leg, turning his Breaft to the right to the Light;
he holds a Spear in his right Hland clofe to his Side; which a Boy is
withholding with all his Strength; for which, another angrily firikes
him with his Bow. Adonis looks downwards, with his Face froncing,
at the Virgin who is at his Feet; pointing, with his left Hand, which
is forethortened, at the Wood; by which Arm Fure is pulling him
thither the is fying, and has a Rudder of a Ship on her Shoulder

prefent a Cupid alfo firing, and pullins him towards the Wood by the
String of the Horn which fiwings by his Side. This Boy is feen quite
from behind, with his Feet flung out, and holding his Bowin his right
Hand, with which he is threatening another, who is tumbled down,
and lyes alfo forethortened, with his Head forwards, and Feet towards
Adoms; he is all in Shade, except his Head, and the Hand with
which he feratches it; his Torch lies near him extinguished

forming him into a Lynx, a Beaft like a Tyger, for violating the
Laws of Hofpiraliev. This Story I would reprefent thus. The King
is not there the Beaft I make taking to flight, thaking from him, a-
bout the Floor, the purple Garment and Crown. This I think moff
agreeable to Narure and Probabilirv. Add to this another Inftance.

this to be reprefented, in order to know what the was, Manor Wo-

cloathed, but dragging her Garment behind her along the Ground.

firming what I have faid. It exhibies the Elyssan Fields, with the
happy Souls ar reft, and Touth, or eternal Spring, dancing and
Rrewing Flowers. Here, we fee Hyscintbus, Narciffas, Crocus, Add-
nis, Ajax, and many others, in fitting Poltures, as when living:
Whence, we may eafily perceive, how difficult it would be to know
them without their particular Badges of Diffinttion, as the Spear,
Hers, Fountaixn, Helmet, Chaplet of Rofes, &cc and how impostible
it was to Pouffin, to excellent and learned a Man, to make Ajax
Known, feeing he there repretents him in the same Rage or Despair,

to wit, Rabbing himself, as when he was before Troy. A great Mit-
take, in my Opinion, with respect to Probabiliry. I should rather
have left it out; as allo the Chamber-pet or Ciffern wherein Narciffus is
rieving himself.
I can hardly believe to frange a Delign to be of Pouffin himfelf;
fince Ajax is placed in to truel a Peffare among the happy Seuls; a
Man who being a Felo de se, rather deferved Hell. Why may not
Sippbus, Ixien, Promethens or Tantalus, who are doomed to hellith
Punithments, be of their Company? Ies true, that Ajax alted only a
gainll himfelf on account of the rms of Acbilles, to which he had
a Claim, and the others offended the Gods; one fiole the Fire from
Heaven, another had the impudence to trepan the Goddefs Tune to his
Lut by an Ambuth, Coc.
Teta has, in my Opinion, in many Particulars, exhibited the fame
Reprefentation, better and more intelligible than Pouffin, as being
much larger, and more plealant and Painter like: But yet he runs
counter to the Probability of that Place of Reft; as we may perceive
in the two Figures of a Boy and Girl, where he is taking lome Flow-
ers out of her Lap, and the, in Return, is ready to feratch out his
Eyes; being an old Quarrel revived. Now, in Falt, neither Ha-
tied, Quarrel or Fealoufy, nothing but Repase and Peace should appear
theic.
But methinks, I hear some fay, that I derogate from the Worth of
thole two great Men, by thus expoling ther Miltakes, and that Tis
caler to find Faulrs than to make a thorough Compofition: Which I
perfectly own; neverthelels, my Incention is not in anywife to build
a Reputation on their Errors; fince it will appear, throughout this
Work, that i am no Kinder to my own Mifakes than to thole of others;

what Ground is moft proper for his Purpofe, in building a Temple, Pa-
lice, &cc. as, whether it be firm or marthy, and to which Quarter
the mult order his Front; and then to proceed to Work. If a Painter
intend to reprefent a Courtship or a military Exercife, Offering, or a-
by thing elle, he will alfo look for a proper Place wherein to lay the

The Golizs of Love perceiving all her Endeavours to be fruicless,
and growing imparent for 4lrs's Return, took her Chariot drawn
by two Swans, and drove fwifily towards the Wood, in order to feek
him, leaving her Grares behind as ufcless at this Juncture; as we shall
further explain at the End of this Ordonnance. Cupid follows her

holding the Spear which is parcly under him; his Head hangs ilmol

frighted, Rarts back, and raifes ker Hands towards Heaven. Cupids
Back is, by the Goddels, partly in the Ground thade; his Breall is
forethortened, his Feet clole, and Knces fomewhat bent; holding a
Torch in his right Hand. Venns, as has been faid, raifes her Hands on
hich, putting out her right Leg, and drawing back her left Foor on
a Cloud, which, behind her, runs up to the right under the Chariot;
her upper Parts incline over the said left Foor; her Chin is funk into
her Breatt; and thus the beholds the Wound. Her Breaft is fore
horrened, and her right Hip is fronting. Behind the aforefaid Oak,
againtt which Adois is lying, the Chariot is feen in Profile, on fome
waving Clouds alike with the Horizon; which about Penus defcend
gradually lighter and lighter to underneath her Foor. The Charior,
tho' gilt, yer kept dark by a Cloud, is elegantly wrought with Chil-
drea, Fehoons and Foliage; behind, on top, is a large Star, and the
Chariot partly hid by the Eody of the Oak. Forwards, besween the
middle and the left Corner, flands a Stone, about three Feet (quare,
with the broken Trunk of a Term, the Refidue whereof, as the Head
and a Part of the Body, he on the Ground, among the Buthes and
Shrubs. This Ccone flands Comewhar obliquely, with the left Corner
towards the left Side of the Piece; clofe to which Side rifes an high
Tree; and a little further, another, quite oversrown g or 6 Feer
high. Behind the Stone, among the Shrubs, Thiftles and Thorns,
the Boar, attempting to fly, lies wounded in Blood and Dirt on its
Forelegs, with its Mouth wide open. On the second Ground, on the

her Shoulder; being almoll to the middle, hid behind the Ground and
in Shade, except her Head and a Part of one Shoulder.
The principal View is on the left Side of the Point of Sight A
little above ir flies Afercury with the Soul of the Vouth, in order to
carry it to the Elyssan Fields. They are both feen forethortened,
with their right sides fronting. The Touth is quite naked, having his
Arm cross his Breaft, his Legs clofe, and his left Foot a little above
the other. Afercary holds him with his left Arm behind about the
middle, and looking at him, with his Caduceas forwards, points to the
Place they are going to. A small Garment, of this winged Meffen

The Ground is craggy and rocky, here and there over run with
Grats, Thiflles and Hollies.

The Light comes from the right side, a little fronting, and the
Weather is rainy. The Air is Winterlike, yet calm. The Trees are
but thinly leaved, except some which can endure the Winter, as Cy.
prets, Laurel, Elm, Briar, Cc. which mult give the moft Green
here. The End of the Fore-ground, on the right side, to the Foor
of the Goddefs, is in Shade, by a Buth and some fmall Trees. Vinus,
Capids upper Paits, the dead Body, with the Ground, and the Tree
againtl which it lies, are flrongly lighted. The Stone forwards, under
Adnis, is mottly thaded with the Fore-ground, by fome Cypreffes on
the right Side, quite forward in the Corner. Some Pieces of the
Term which reprefents a Fuaus or Satyr) lying fomewhat further,
receive a little Light. The Boar, whofe Hind-parts are hidden be
tween the left side of the Stone and the Tree flanding by it, partakes
allo of that Shade to almoff his Neck. The happy coul flying with
the winged Meffenger,
intt by the Tree or Chariot, is, with him,
from the Feet to the Mildle, thaded by the Leaves and Branches of
the Trees; and are farabore the Horizon, to that the Green of the
Trees almoll touches their Heads. The Sign Cup,icorn, in Token of
the firft Winter-month, appears in the Air, very faint and lighter
than the Air; Tis juft over the Charior, where the Sky is darkett.
As for the Colours, I order them thus. Tenus is in an airy Dress of
pale Rofe colour, with a blue Veil over it. Adonis, with his right
Shoulder and Breaft bare, has a light Fillemor Vellment, with Vio
let Reflexions; his Cheeks are paie, and Lips livid, and to are his
Hands and Feet, yet he has a beautiful Skin. Jenus is very clear and
tender-skind; her Face and Hands warm. Cupid is of a middling
Complexion, not to clear as the Goddefs, and fomewhat more roly
than Adonis. Tenus has light Hair; Adonis, light Chelnut, and Cupid,
brown Hair.
This Subject requires more Cypress and Myrile than other Sorts of
Trees
The Ground forward, from the right side to beyond the Stone, is
marthy.
I do not incroduce the Graces here, as in the preceding Ordonnance,
becaute they are improper; for they muft not attend tenus on forrow:
fut Occassons, as having a quite different fe and Meaning, as we
shall here oberve; and the rather, fince in the former Ordonnance
we have thewed the Significations of Venus, Adonis, Alers and the
wild Boar.

C H A P. KIII. The Fable of Dryope, for the Embellispment of
Landskips.
A VIN G in the preceding Chap. delivered what I had to fay
touching a fine Fable, and the myfterious Senfe of some Circum-
stances, I find myfelf obliged, by the Satisfaction which feve-
ral of the beft Arcifts have found therein, to gratify their Defires,
and to give an Handle for Exercife, in skerching fuch another.
I have cholen for this Purpofe, the Fable of Dryope, and will 2-
dapt it as much as poffible to the Ornament of Landskips, making it
2 Without-door Prospect.
The Story, according to Ovil, is this. Dryope, infentible of the
forrowful Difafter that was to befal her, on a certain Time took a
Walk by a Lake encompaffed with Myresss, with intent to make the
R r

Nymphs of the Place, Prefents of Garlands of Flowers. She took
with her, her little Son Amphifus, not a Vear old, accompanied by her
Bifter fole, with a Basker of Flowers and wreathed Garlands. Near
the Lake food a Tree, called Lotos, bearing red Bloffoms; of which
the rathly broke a Twig to pleafure her Child; but perceiving Blood
to iffue from it, and that the whole Tree was thereby violently agi-
cated, the was much affrighted; and the more, when, in going thence,
the fell her Feet to fatten into the Earth; for the was transformed into
2 Tree.
I exhibir the Subject (See Plare L IV.) in a delightful Valley, (ac.
cording to the Tellimony of the Poet) planted with Myrtles, and en-
compatted by a Brook. In the middle of the Piece, I place, as the
Principal, the Tree Lofos, full of red Bloffoms and thickly leaved.
From this Tree Dryope broke off the Sprig. I make it to thake and
more to violendy, that the Trunk of it is by that means become dif
corted and winding. On the left Side, 1 place the rath Dryope, of a
beautiful Air, and bla-k-hair’d, having her Son Amphifes about the
Middle, in her left Arm. She advances with her left Foot towards the
Tree, a lide drawing back the right. Her upper Parts fall back Hill
more. In her right Hand, lifeed up, the holds the bloody Sprig; at
which the flares in Confaiion. Her left Thigh comes forward. Her
upper Parts (way to the lefe; her Breatl is almoll fronting directly a-
gainil the Light; her Face in Protile more or lels turns back; and her
Feer are by this time fixed in the Ground. We fee the Childs hind
er Parts; and us Head is fer off againtt her Breaff. Her siffer on the
right Side of the Tree, flanding over againtt her, I reprefent with
light Hair, and in the wimoll Concern, wringing her ciafped Hands 2.
gainft her left Check. Her Head, turned to the right, hangs over
her right Shoulder; her Breaff heaves; and her under Parts draw
quite back. Her Knees are bent, her right Foot finng out, and the
left drawn back, as if the were fainting away. She is about 14 of
16 Years of Age. The Nymph, who lupports Drgege, is placed be
tween her and the Tree, holding her Back with her left Hand, and
with her right, uncovering the Leg, and thewing to the Sifter, at whom
the looks, that the Foor has already taken Root. Another Nymph,
who is taking the Child, has her left Side fronting, yer her Back
parts are mostly vifible; the is on her Knees, the left forward, the o
ther quite drawn back, puthing with her Foot againtt a Water-veffel,
which, at the Brink of the Water, the overturns. A third, on the
right Side, comes running, quite aftonithed, with a Lap fall of Flow-

ers; the points, with her left Hland, towards the others, and looks to
the leff at her Companions ficting on the Bank of the River, which
partly runs between the Trees towards the Point of Sight. The one
arifes, and looks forward with Amazement, and makes it known to
the other fitting towards the Water; who therefore, fupporting herfelf
on her left Hand, turns her upper Parts to the right, in order to look
back. They have mottly Chaplers either on their Heads or lying by
them.
Thus much, as to the Difpoficion and Actions of the moveable By-
ornaments; which confifting of Virgins, each is contralted according ro
ber Paffien. We now proceed to the immoveable Ornaments.
On the left Side, on a rifing Ground, between the Trees, I place
a large fronting Priapus-Term, without Arms or Legs, mottly in the
shade againtt the Offskip, which frongly throws off the foremoff
Croup. On the right side forwards, half in the Water, I fet a square
large rough Stone, whereon lies a Garment or Veil, and a Parcel of
Leares and Flowers. In the Pannel of this Scone is carved a Fatality
in Balsrelief. Behind it, and between the Nymph with the Flowers,
I place on the Ground a Basket of Chaplets.
As for the Season, Tis laid between Summer and Winter, in the ripe-
ning Aucumn, and in fine Weather for the Time of Vear. The Ligbt
is a side one a lictle fronting. The Sun may be put in, or left out, as
every one pleafes; becaute tis not meationed or infifted on in the
Fable.
I shall next proceed to delcribe the further Circumflances of this Or-
donnance; fince, without thewing the Light and Darkness, Harmony
and Colours, Tis imperfelt, and not like Narure. It matt be granted,
that the Harmony and Sbalowing, ofcenrimes thew themfelves, and that
the Light is fufficieatly apparent to him who undertands Perspective
Bur whether there may not occur fill someching beyond the common
Guess and Judgment, I very much question. As for the Colours, they
mall needs be exprefted; fince, without it, tis impoffible to know or
penetrate mine or any other Painter's Thougt ts.
1 therefore affign Dryege, as the principal Charalter, a blue Sattin
Garment; one Flappet whereof goes over her right Shoulder, and comes
under her Cirdle, and the other is in her left Hand; with which the
holds the naked Child about the Middle, when the Remainder, with
an under Flap tucked in the Girdle under her left Bresfl, covers all
her other Parts down to the Feet, except the leff Leg and Foor, whichh
is rooted in the Ground. Her under Garment, as likewife the open

Seere abor her lef Arm, is yellowith White, with green Reffexions.
Her Garment next the left Leg is open. The foremofl Nymph is al.
mort mked, having no other Covering than a fine white fmall Scarf
about her Middle. The Drefies of Dryope and Lole are intermixed
with Gold, in order to make a Difference between them and the
Nymphs. The Nymph, who is naked to the Middle, I dress in a dark
green Gown, gathered at the Navel, and faftened by a Girdle. Jol
has an arry Garment, clote-fleeved, of a bright Rofe-colour, girt with
2 broad Girdle of dark Violet embroidered with Gold; and under it
a flowered Coat, open below, and giving Freedom to the Legs. The
Sione forward is greyith; and the Vetiel dark Red. The Ground next
7
the Water is gratty; and thus, I variegate the whole Fore-ground.
The Nymph, who, on the right Side of the fecond Ground comes
running, has a greenith Brealtgarment, loofe and untied, without
Sleeves, and faftened but on one Shoulder, the sedd Brealtand Legs be
ing bare. The other, firting further behind, on the Edge of the
Rver, I leave quire naked. Her Companion has a small green Scarl
The fone Priagus is dark Grey, inclinable to Violet.
As for the Liget, I think, that the major Part ought principally to
fall on Dryoge and the two Nymphs next ber, and on what elfe belongs
to that Group. The Refidue may be litle, and moftly foreign liybted,
either from behind, before or fidewife; yet in fuch Sort, as that the

plainly appear: Otherwife, they will be but loofe Fancies, without

Light, falling on her middle Parts, to wit, Belly and Legs, the naked
Child would be more beautifully fet off, if her Breaft or upper Parts
were dark, than againtt the yellowith-whice. This with Respect to

againt the dark Ground: Bot the Blue has here, on account of the
great Mass, more Power, tho' having more Light about ir; for the
Red is but a fmall Spot. I have, as much as poffible, confidered the
Probabiliry of this Reprefentation, and the Harmony in the Dilpofiti-
onof the Colours; affigning each Figure its particular and proper em-
blematic Coloar, not only in the Draperies but alfo in the Nudities,
giving one a fair and tender, another, a more brownith Skin, and to
forth. Each Figure has likewife its particular Charalteriffic; the
Head of the Water-nymph is adorned with white Bell-fowers; that of
the Woodnympb, with wild Plants; and that of her who comes running
forward, with Field-fowers. If it be wondered, that I make Mention
of Sattin; fince we rarely hear, it was in Ufe among the Anciets; I
fay, the Obtervation is jull, with respect to Staruarres, but not, as to
Painters; becaute I have met with feveral old Pictures, whereinI have
seen Sattin reprefented: Bur how long that Stuff has been known to the
World, I cannot tell, nor shall enquire. In the meantime, it mult be
allowed to be a beautiful and elegant Sruff; as are alfo the changeable
Silks, tho' in alels Degree, and more proper for youg People.
If any Difficulty arile from my incroducing into this Story a Priapus-
Term, fince theres neither God, Man, Faunus, or Satyr in the whole
Piece, nor the lealt Sign of any, indecent Action, I will give him my
Reafon; which is, that the Poct, relating the firft Caule of the Difafter
befalling this unhappy Woman, afcribes it to the Tree Lores; becaute
when a Woman, and Priapus could not farisfy his Lult with her, he
in Revenge, transformed her into that Tree bearing her Name, laying:
a Curfe on thofe who violated it; and fill recains that vindictive In-
mour; wherefore 1 place him here, as the firft Promoter of the Ac
cident.
I inliff largely on thefe Fables or Ordonnances, to give an Handle for
further Inquiries into them; for Ovid is not full and parricular in all his.
Fables, and we are obliged to ferch a great deal from other Authors.
He gives us no right ideg of the Tree Lotes, (a Stranger to these Coun-
tries) nor mentions, what Sort of Leating it has, or its Virtues, or
whether it be of a moiff or dry Nacure, or where it grows moll plen-
tifully; wherefore, as far as I have mer with them, I shall produce
the Teltimonies of fome Authors about this Tree, together with the
emblematic Senfe and Explanations they affign: A very proper Part of
Knowledge for a Landskip- painter, whofe inclination leads him to fome-
thing uncommon, and delires to pats for Eearned among the curious and
knowing.

I have found, in general, that the Leaves are round; which, at the
Fring Sun, opin, and as he goes down, close, and at Night, double;
wherefore, when we incroduce no Sunpine, they mult be reprefented
deubied or suunt.
As for the myterious Seaje, we mult know, that the Egyptians paid
more Honours to this Tree, than any others, on a Belief, that it was a
AEharor between heavenly and earchly Things. Iis moreover ufed,
to repreient the Suns Rifing and Seiring; especially with the Addition
of a CoiI peringon it, by which, they lignitied, the Morning vapours,
which the Sun's Approach difpels. And, becaufe it opens and thuts its
Leaves with the Suns Riling and Setring, tis fucred to Apollo, as a Tree
peculiar to him, and out of Respect prving its Leaves to him only.
The reugh or heiry Loros was allo much venerated by the Romans;
who offered the 1yiats Locks of Hair to it, & as they did, thole of joung
Mlen to Ipolle, or to his Son Esculapius.
The Greeks facrificed their Hair, in the same manner, to the Rivers
of their Country, as having a certain Relation to this Tree; which they
imagined had fuch Intercourse with the Gods, that they made it their
Sest: And therefore it was plunted in Moruffes.
Lumblickus reftifies, that thefe Treesrequire much Moisture; wheace,
the Ancients inferred, the firz Cause of Procreation: Therefore calling
the Occean, the Father of all Creatures: nd, obferving the round
Leaves, round Stem and round Fruit, they would, by this moft perfed
Fisure, intimate, the Perfection of the higheff Deity,; especially, when
a Childwas reprefented firing on the Tree. Which Ovid likewife al
Iudes to in this Fable, when (as Mir. Pope has rendered it) he fays,

Wte hhall now proceed to,
A second Table or Ordennance reluting to Dryope.
The Story is this. As foon as Andramen was advertifed of the for
rowful Accident which had happened to his Wife Dryope, he hafted to
the Place in Company with his Father: But they arrived too late, to

have any Specch with her before the Meramorghofs. A rough Bark
had now feized her Body and Members; infomuch, that she was only
to be known from other Trees by her Shape and foft Voice. Her Arms
made two Branches, abounding with Leaves; befides her Head attire,
covered with Greens. Both the Father and Son hung about her Neck,
and wept; and, with the Child, at her Requelt, kifled her for the latt
Time, Whereupon the was divefted of her human Shape at once.
in the former Ordonnance, I have ordered the River forwards, and
in this, lideways. Dryope, all but her Head, transformed into a Myr-
thetree, I place, almoff in the middle of the Piece, ffanding upright,
a little to the left of the Point of Sight. Andramon takes her abour
the Neck, and Kiffes her left Cheek. His aged and forrowful Father
complains of the forrowful Milhap to a Nymph Handing near him,
with his right fland tearing open Dryope's Linnen, in order to thew
her the Body; which beholding, the raifes her Shoulders, turning her
Head away, and looking down. Another Nymph, having the lirtle
Amphises in her Arms, lifts him up, in order to kifs his Mother. fo.
to I place in great Lamentation at Dryege's Feet; and a Step further
Hands the Tree Lotes.
On the second Ground, on the right Side, I fer
the Term of Priapus, crols hung with Feffoons of Flowers and Greens
bied under the Navel; and before it a Gnall fmoaking Altar, with
tome People offering. On the left Side, on the Fore-ground, I place
the large (quare Stone, half under Warer; with a Nymph leaning on
it. Thele are the Heads of my Defign. The View is on the left
side of the Point of Sight, and confitts of Hills and Waters; and,
becaule I reprefent an Evening, the Air is full of Vapours and dark
Clouds; and the Trees, by reafon of the Wind, are in Agitation
Now, as this Piece is the Feltow of the former, all Things thould,
of right, be equally full of Work; but becaute this Ordonnance has
the greater Variety, as exhibicing jome Aen, I have been neceffitared
to depart a little from the original Diupolition, fince what is introdu-
ced into the other muft needs be feen here; as we have largely treated.
in the 21ff Chap. Of Ordonmance. Wherefore, 1 place Dryope front-
ing, with both her Arms lifted up, and pretsy near each other. Her
Head loofely hangs down between them, to the left. Her Arms,
from the Elbows upwards, together with her Breail and a lirtle of her
Body, retain their firft Forms. Andramon is feen, on the left Side,
Handing on Tip-toe in order to Kits her left Check, which the offers

Nymph to whom he complains; at the fame Time, opening Dryepe's
Under-garment, only ried on her Shoulder with 4 Ribbon, and curn-
ing his Head and upper Parts to the left, with his Face towards Hea-
ven. The Nymph tlands clote behind him very dejected and forrow-
fal. railing her Shoulders, and looking downwards with her Head a
tirtle fulling off from Dryoge; her left Elbow is drawn in, and her
open Hand up at her Head; her Breaff is bare, and in the Light.
Her under Parts are fronting, and her right Leg fiung our. Andra-
mon's Garment, falling from his Shoulder, hangs about his Heels.
The Numph, who, on the right side, where the Ground is fome.
whit lower, is litring up the Child, falls back in her upper Parts,
with her Head hanging forwards; the refts on her right Leg, having
the leff lified up against the Tree; her Back is fronting, and turns to
the Light, and her under Parts have a contrary Sway. The Child,
whofe upper Parts only are feen (the reft being hidden by her Head)
firetches our both his rms forwards, towards the Tree,
preffing one
of his Feet againt her Body. Jok, fitting (quar between her and the
Tree, leans her left Shoulder againtt it, with her Head coming for
wad, and her Hand on her Face, having a Cloth in her Lap. On the
left Side, without the Piece, at the End of the Fore-ground, I place
two Nimphs; one, with her Legs in the Water, and refting on her
right Elbow, and holding her Chin, and with the other Hland under
her right Arm pit; the other ficting with her Legs behind the former
in the Water, and refting with her right Arm on a Vafe, and her
Face and right Breat foreright: They are both naked and winged.
Near thefe slands a third, holding a long Staff, on the cop whereof

with her right Hand forward; in which Pofition, her right side is
feen. Behind her, on the aforefaid Stone, lies Dryope's Garment; and
on the fame Side forwards rifes a large Tree, incumber’d with wild
Bathes and Sprigs
The Light1 take, as in the former, from the right Side a litde
fonring; for, were it a left one, it would not fo commodioutly bring
the light Parts together in a Croap; and the rather, as the Piece is a
Fellow of the former.
I repreient then, the expiring Dryage, bare almoff to the middle,
by the dropping her under Garment; which, as in the former, is fel
lowith whice. Her Face and Breaff retain their Flethiness and Co
lour, but her Body downwards grows darker and browner, like Wood
colour, till at laft it is perfectly woody; as happens alfo to her Arms,

dremon to the Shoulder, is in the Shade of the Greens of her Head
and Arms. Andramon, as a Man of Repute, has a thort greenith
grey colour’d Cost, embroidered with Gold; his upper Garment is
reddith Purple, dark and warm; and his Legs, up to the Hips, are in
the Shade of the Tree. The old Aian is drell after the Persian Man
ner, in a Gown reaching to the Calves of his Legs, of a light Fille-
mot Colour, with large Violer Stripes and Gold Leaves; his upper
Garment, fleeved and quite open, is beautiful Violet; he has shoes
and wide Stockings; his Cap, like a Turbant, curling on Top, lies
with his Staff at his Feet; and his Hair is grey. The Nymph by his
Side, is half shaded by him; that is, her whole right Side, from the
Shoulder downwards, except her Knee, which the advances; her Vefl-
ment is greenith Blue, inclining fomewhar to dark. The Nymph
with the Child has an airy blue Garment, girt about the Middle; her
right Shoulder is bare, and the Flappet of her Garment ruffied about
her Legs by means of the Wind. The Virgin behind her, and be-
tween the Tree Lores, has a white Garment. The Priaphs-Term, be-
tween the Trees is by them, moftly shaded; and off from it, paffing by
the Point of Sight, the major Part is filled up with small Trees, which
are dark or in Shade, and brightly fetting off the foremoff Group.
The two naked Nymphs, on the left Side, receive little Light. The
Air on the Horizon is full of Vapours and melting; becaute I do not
give here the Sun to bright and clear as in a fine Morning, nor to
Rrong as at Midday, but more or lets vapourith, and therefore the
whole appears of a Ruffet Colour. The Cloudsare large, thick, and
heavy.
The Sky might allo be properly enriched, by exhibiting in it, the
three Purce or Fatat Siffers; fince, having done their Buliness, they
are again afcending. In fuch Cale, Atrepos, with the Thread and
Eciffors, ought to be foremoft; next to her, Lachefss, with the Spindle;
and behind her, Clotko, with the Dillaff.
Let us now exhibit Andramon and his Fumilys Return Home, in
A Third Table or Ordennance of Drjope. See Phite LV.
The late Dryope, after her Fate, fands, with the Tree Lotes, at
the End of the Fore-ground. A little to the right of the Point of

Crekcent, coming forward; againtt which, the Water, from the right
Side, about 2 Feer lower, is walking. Quite forwards, againtt the
Shore, lies a Paffage-boar. On the right side, without the Picture, I
reprefent a Piece of very high Ground, running towards the Point of
Sight. At the botcom of this Ground, and almoff level with the
Water, runs a Path, edged with fome watry Trees and even some of
them in the Water. The second Ground rifes Hilllike againtt the
Offskif; especially on the right, from whence to the leff Side, thro'
the Hollow of the Rock, is teen a further Offship. Behind this Hill
or Height appears the beautful Top of Andramon's Houlc.
I believe it will not feem odd to the Knowing, that I introduce to
much high Ground and Water abour fo small a Spot of low Land,
becaute the Poet lars the Fact in a Late; for which Reafon, and in
order naturally to fhew ir, I exhibit that Corner, with the Way Cre-
Lcent like, as being but a Part of the Lake.
The Quellion is now, whether a Painter may not take fome Liber
1y for LETOryn's Sake ? 1 fav, he may, to far as not to take away
the Progerty of the Subjert; for what the Writer lays down mult pais
for a Law; wherefore we may well conclude, that Ovid does not fay
any thing withour Reafon Some may poffibly think I could have
made a more delightyf Croice: But it mut be obterved, that this Falt
is of a cont,ary Asture; I feek not for Pleafure in the midft of Ser-
row, which here is my principal Scope; as may appear by what

The Boat, tied to a Poft, lies fomewhar fidewife and fore-thortened.
The Waterman's right Side is fronting, inclining to the Land, with
his Back directly in the Light; he receives with excended Arms, the
Garment and Basket of Flowers which lole gives him. His Vellment
is light Grey, gire with a large black Girdle, which is buckled; his
right Shoulder is bare almoft to the Middle. Joh appears with her left
Side fore right, and her Breatt fwaying towards him; giving him the
Basket of Flowers with her right Hand, on the Arm whereof hangs
her Sifter's Garment; her under Parts are fronting, and her Feet clole,
with Knees a little bent; the turns her Head to the left, wiping her
Eyes with a Flappet of the Vail which the has about her Neck. An.
dramon, with the licle Amphifus in his Arms, Rands on one Leg, and
is fepping cowards the Boat; his upper Pares turn to the left, his Breat
fronting, and his right rm put out fideways, in order to thew the
Waterman, as has been faid, the Place he would be carried to; the
purple Garment is faltened on his right Shoulder, and from under his
Arm llinging about his Body, he thereby partly covers the Child; and
with another Flappet of the fame, which he has in his left Hand, he
supports and holds the Child, on his riting Hip againtt his left Brealt.
The Child holds him fall about the Neck, with is left Hland in the
Opening of his under Garment, leaning back with its upper Parts from

it fares to the right side; one of its Feet is feen hanging down between

The old Man, who follows him, has his Back turned towards the Point

Heaven his right Leg is put forward, and his left, whereon he flands,
drawn fomewhat back; his right Arm is crofting his Body; and in
that Hand he holds his Statl, against his left Breaft; and thrufting our

Sweet Repose difturbed by Lewdness. An Emblem.
Here are feen three young Nymphs of Diungs Train, tired with
Hunting, repoling in the Shade of the Trees, a hitle off from the
Road, and near a foamy Water: Which some Fauni and Satyrs eipy-
ing, they were refolved to have fome Sport with them. Wherefore
acquainting their Affociates with the Marter, they filently advanced
cowards the Place in a Body; bringing with them one of the largeft
Priapus-Terms they had, together with two Panthers, a Veffel of
Wine and Some Grapes. Being arrived, and feeing the Nymphs al-
molt naked, and faft alleep, they planted before the Place the afore-
said hideous Scarecrow; and then fofily fole their Hunring-equipage,
25 Quivers, Arrows, Bows, Cc. and hung them on its Genitals, fail-
eaing them with the Straps, which they buckled. They moreover
deck’d its Head with one of the Nymphs Vails; flicking their Thyr-
fes in the Ground round about it, and adorning them with Vizors.
Not Ropping here, they feized as many of the Virgins Garments as
they could, and toffed them upon the high Limbs of an adjoining.

them, they tied the two Panthers under the Tree; and, after having
let down the Wine and Grapes, pleated with the Project, they coveri-

the double Haurboy, Cymbal, Tabor, Timbrel, Cc. wherewith, be
caule Twas Evening, and they might lleep too long, to beat up their
Quarters. But the Plot foon mifcarried, through an unexpected Ac-
cident; for, another Nymph, who was poltibly feeking for her Com-
pany, happened to arrive at the Place; and leeing the Panthers lying
under the free, and thinking they were wild, thor at them and killed
one. The Satyrs, feeing this, came out of their Lurking-hole, and
purfued her; but the elcaped by Flight. They then concluded, they
had waited long enough; and, oblerving that it grew lare, and that

But, being now thoroughly awaked, the Tirm prefented before them,

mine who was on that Overture, moft dathed and concerned. A little
Satyr thot at the Tirm, and took the Quivers from it, shewing the
Nymphs the unteemly Member, with an hearty Laughter. This
(but especially when other Scoffers thewed them the Cloaths on the
Tree) highly provoked them. To take to Flight was not advifeable;
one piuhed them this Way, ancther, that Way. During this Game,
a Noile of Cornets was heard; which fuddenly put an End to the
Laughter; each made off leaving all Things as they food. The
Term of Pringus fell to the Ground, and the Panther at the Tree en
deavoured in van to ger loofe. Now, Diuns appears attended by her
Train of Nymphs; who thot their Arrows ar the lewd Crew, the
Dogs, at the fame Time, tearing the Panther to pieces. The fearful
Nymphe appeared much athamed, and profirated themfelves at the
Feet of the Goddets; to whom they related their Misfortunes, and
the Affront put upon them by the Cang of Satyrs; shewing her, at

and what elfe was done in despite to them. The Goddess, to thew

her Refentment, gave immediate Order to purfue the Rioters; and
would not enlighten the Night till the had revenged the Infolence.
Some accordingly made towards the Woods, others to the Brooks, and
the Refidue took the Field; in a little Time, part of them were made
Captives; for of the three who purfued the Nymph for thooting the
Panther, one was catched in the Net, and five others, together with a
Baccbanal, were foon after haled before Diana, in lrons; whom the
tentenced to be tied, two and two together, by the Feetard whipped by
the three affronted Nymphs with Thorns and Holmleaves to teverely,
as almoft to kill them. Three others the adjudged to be hung by their
Tails on the Limbs of Trees, with their Heeds juff touching the
Ground. Not yet appeafed, te cauled him, who was taken in the Ner,
to be therein planged into the Water, by two or three Nymphs, till he
was julf expiring, and the Water came out of his Mouth. The Bac-
chanal mull he all this; on whom was beflowed an hunting Knife,
wherewith, if the thought fir to releafe the Delinquents, to cut off their
Tails: Which after mach Reluctance, the was at laft prevailed upon to
do; and then, tying their Hands behind them, Diana faid 60
nocs, and shere yourfelves to the reft of year wanton Gang, and tell
them, that thus feill puniss all those who dare to mock the chaft Diana
and her Retinue.
Is not this now, tho' a feigned Story, Matter fufficient to furnith
many Landskips 2 The Landekip-painter ought to obferve here a Re-
pretentation of different Pasions; Bashfalness in the Nymphs; rean-
ton Joy in the Satyrs; Severity and Refentment in the GGoddets and
Diftress in the Iafolents.
You fee here the alluring Pleafure of committing a Crime, and the
Bithfulness and Difliets of thote who fuffer the Evil; but at the same
Time, the grievous Confequences, and Punithment attending Wicked
nets and Infolence. In fine, the Sweets and Punifhment of Evil, ard
the Reward and unexpected Relief of Virtue.
Can it be denied that fuch a Reprefentation in Landskip will not
generally pleate? Surely, Tis not impoffible to make other fuch Pe-
figns. On which Occafion, I hope it will not be riretome to the Reader

H ER Esfcarce any Thing in the World which is not liable to a

Things a Mediam, out of thofe two Contrarieries, which is certainly
the moff beautiful and beft. This is an especial Truth in the Art of
Painting; which has fuch a Power as to affect People two different
Ways: Firft, by virtuous and agreeable Reprefentations; and in the
next Place, by thofe which are mean, mishapen and contemptible;
both equally efficacious in Contrariety. The former recreates and


charms a judicious Eye, and the latter is ir's verfion. 1is therefore
indifpurable, that the Painter-like, or, moft beautiful Choice, implies
nothing elfe than what is worihy to be painted; and that the moft mean,

lying up and down in Confulion; likewife muddy Brooks, a gloomy
Sky, abounding with heavy Clouds; the Field furnished with lean Car-
tle and Vagabonds or Cypfies, fuch a Piece, I fay, is not to be called a
fine Landskip. Can any one, without Reafon, affert him to be a Painter-
like Object, who appears as a lame and dirty Beggar, clothed in Rags,

Splay-footed, bound about the Head with a nafty Clout, having a Skin
as yellow, as a baked Pudding, Killing Vermine; or in fine, any fuch
paltry Figure? Would you not rather conclude fuch Things to be the
foll of a Painter.
For my Part, I believe, that the Difference between the Fine and the
bigly istoo great not to make a Diffindion between them. I am well plea-
ied, that some call the Works of Bambeccio, Browwer, and Moller,
and the Landskips of Bruegbel, Bril, Bloemart Saury, Berchem and
such Mafters, Painter-like But 1 oppofe to them Raphael, Correggie,
Poufin, te Bran, c. and in Landskip, Albani, Genenille, Poufin,
the German Polydore, and such as follow them in their Choices.
On this Occation, 1 shall, ere I conclude, alfo confider the Word
Defigser-like; a Word which is as much perverted as the other: For
Iaffance crooked Trees abounding with Knots and Hollownelfes,
rugged Clods of Earth, burften and sharp Rocks, human Bodies ro-
buttly and roughly mufcled in Michael Angelo's Manner, Faceslarge.
featured, long-nofed, wide-mouthed, hollow-eyed like Testa's; thefe
Objects we have extolled for Designer-like, tho' as abfurdly and im-
Properly, as tis to fetch Light out of Darknets, and Virtue from
Vice.
The Mafters therefore are very imprudent, who encourage their Dif
ciples to feek and draw in fo troublefome a Way, after fuch Objects,
as tending to nothing elfe than learning them to make rough Out-lines.
Do they not chuse a round about-way to bring them into the right
Path? Nay, how many die in the Purfuit, who, had they taken the
other Way, might eafily have got through? Wherefore, tis more ad-
vitsble to draw alter the beautifal and fedate Simplicity and Great-
ness of Raphael, Touffin and other excellent Mafters, than after any
of thofe other palery and mif thapen Objects. This muff be agreed
that if the bad and deformed be Painter or Defigner-tike, the beauti-
fat is not so: The Cafe admits of no lteration; and confequently
the worft muft be beft, and the beft worll. If both be good, there
is no room for Choice; and you may, at that rate, mingle Beauty with
Deformity, Joy with Sorrow, Ripeness with Unripeness, Gods with
Beggars But fince Beauty is attralting, and Deformity offentive, this
certainly is true Painter-like, which fuppoles the best and moft agreea-
ble Objects; which alone ought to be called fo, and fought for.
fet there are Occafions, wherein both muft be obferved; either that
the Story requires it, or that, by Means of Deformity, we are to fet
off what is beautiful, and make it predominate: But then the Paint-

or who underflands Beauty, may more eafily abate, than the other exalt
himfelf above his Knowledge and Capacity. Wherefore I conclude,
that beautiful Nature is the beft Choice, and the most Painter-like.
I shall now, for the Benefit of fuch Artifts as are not rich in
Invention, give a compendious Description of Variery of Objects in
a fiditious View.
C H A P. XVI. Of Painter-like Beanty in the open Hir.

H E Day was almoff thut in, and the agreeable weffery Sungiv-
ing long and charming Ground-fnades, when I purpoted to divert
mytsif with a Walk; not without reffecting, how many fine Obferva-
bles are orerlosked, which, if handled, according to Rule, would be
of Service. A Carelefinets often proceeding from too luperficial and
groundlets a Method of Study; which will not permit the Thoughts
to fix on Things of moft Importance.
In my Walk, I cane into an agreeable Country, feemingly the Seat
of blessed Souts where nothing was wanting which could tend to the
Repoie of the Mind; every Thing was beautiful and orderty: Blind
Chance had no Hand in this; I could plainly perce.ve, with what Ar-
dour and Pleaiure Natere and Art had mutually bellowed their Benefits
upon it: The Roads or Palfages were to neat and level, that in walking
you hardly feemed to rougch the Ground: A sweet and refrething lyind
reigned there; which fo aliryed the Sun's Heat as to make it indifferent
whether you lat in it, or in the Shade: The rich-leaved Trees, as beau-
tifal in their Siems as their Greens, moved almoff infentibly; when
the young and tender Sprouts, as yet bat thinly leaved, carelled by
the mild and gentle Air, feemed to rejoice, the filver Leaves, by a
fweet Motion, glittering like Medals. The Sky was fine blue,
loofing gradually in thin Air towards the Horizon: The fmall Clouds,
not violently driving this Way and thar, moved flowly and quictly till
they got out of Sight. The white Swans beheld themfelves in the
clear Brooks; freely winding and turning without feeling whether
with or againff the Stream.
In this delightful Region, I found a very beautiful Fountain, the
Bafon of which, was of whire Marble; furnished towards the Road
with rocky Bowls and Scollops to receive the Water; the Figures,
flanding upon it, were moft elegantly chosen; round it, food low and
clote

cloke May-trees, againtt the Green whereof, the white Marble was
magnificently, yet modeftly, fer off; cauting thus a pleating Mixture
in its Shade.
From thence, I took to the right Hand, along a level and broad
Way, on both Sides faced with a Parapet of Free-ftone, whereof
food forwards two large Vafes of ffeth-coloured Marble, in Shape
and Ornament like thofe in the Farnese Garden; wide on Top,
and without Covers; but, infiead of an Ipbigenis, the faint carving
confiffed of dancing Women; thele Vaies had a wonderful fine
Sweep, the Figures were orderly difposed, and in all Parts alike and
moderately filled with Work; and becaute the Bats-relief rofe fo lit-
tle, the whole appeared as yer freth and undamaged.
The Parapet was buill after the Deric Order, and its Pannels were
adorned with Foliage and Branch-work, twined with Reeds.
The knd of it let me into a wide fandy Road; on the left Side bor-
dered with a gentle floreing River, and on the right, with fine and large
Trees; along the Brink of this River were planted only grey and
whitith Willows, not all alike Rreight and large, but some leaning over
the Water, others clole-branched and leaved, others again, thin and
young, difcovering the Glitter of the Water: On the right Side,
where the Rond run high, tood, as I lay, large and heavy Trees of
Various Kinds, fuch as Oak, Affi, Lime, wild Olive, Pine, Cypress,
Gr. Some with freight Stems, round Tops, fwaying Branches, and
fine Greens; between which, tome tender Suckers, with their finall
and upright Stalks and airy Leaves, afforded an inexprettible elegant
Variety. The brown Cypreffes, Iiden with their Frair, added no small
Laffre to the green of the other Trees; to my great Delight. Under
thofe Trees grew some wild Simples, and various Kinds of large and
fmall-leaved Planrs intermixed with Thiftles and Thorms in an agreea-
ble and moft Painter-like manner. Thefe under Growths, but efpe-
cially the Grass on the Sides, were in many Places duffed by the Read;,

At proper Dillances, along both Sides of the Rosd, were placed,
for the Kafe of Travellers, tome low Free-fione Seats, in the Form of
a long and narrow rchitrave, fapported by two (quare Pillers.
Going on, I came to a Crossway, where I found a Ferm or Gaide
fet up. Here, not to gowrong, I was at a Stand, which Way to take:
In this Doubt I recollected, that those Guides have commonly their
Paces towards the Way Strangers and Travellers ought to go. This
Term was down to the lower Belly, like a Man, yet very mufculons;
and the Head, refembled that of a Satyr, and guarded with two large

crooked Rams Horns; it food in a Gap between fome Trees, half
shaded with Leaves and lvy; it feemed to be made of Marble, but very
much bedripped and fouled with a green Liquor. A little from it, I
faw, on a white Marble Plinth, a decumbent Statue of a naked Nymph,
relling with her Elbow on a Vafe fhedding Water; which flowing
Cown the Plinth below the Way, which was there a little rocky,
run into the River; this Figure was very agreeable I wondered at
firft, fince if flood not far from, and lower than the Term, that yet it
was much cleaner; thinking that in fuch a Place it could not well main
tain it's Beauty and Whitenets; but my Wonder ceafed on perceiving,
that there were no high Trees over it, but that it had a free Air;
annother reafon was, that being to low as to be reached over, poffibly
some Drafifman had been at the Place, and wiped it clean: On fuch a
Conjecture, I took some Water out of the Vaie into my Hand, and
rubbed a Part of the Shoulder; which confirmed my Sufpicion; for 1
difcovered, that fome Parts, were already become fmooth and gloffy,
by being handled and rubbed.
Stepping a litile further, I faw another Sight as fine as the former; 1
tay, fine with reffect to Art. It was an ancient Tomb er Sepulchre of
light red Marble, intermixed with dark grey, and whice Eyes and Veins;
with a Lid or Cover of Lapis Lazuli. This Tomb was fupported by
four whice Marble Sphinxes without Wings, retting on a large black
marble Plinth, which through ir's Duftinets, feemed to be lightiff.
grey. The Ground under it was rugged, yet level for three or four
Feet round the Plinth. This Work was generally encompaffed with
Sand extending to the Sea-thore, which it faced; and ten of 12 Steps
further, the Sea was feen foaming. In the middle of the Belly of the
Tomb, was a found Bass-relief, within a Compartment of Oak-leaves;
it exhibited a flying Eagle, with Thunder in its Bill; whence I con-
jeltured, it might be Pbacion's Grave; and the rather, becaufe there
food near the Corners three very old and large Cypreffes; of which,
the hindmoff was as yet whole and found, but the forward ones, by
Weather or otherwife, to damaged, that one had loft it's Top, and the
other was on one Side, half unbranched and bare. Behind this Tomb,
Rood a large Pedeftal of greyifh-blue Stone, on which had formerly, as
it feemed, been fet an Urs, now fung down, and lying near it half
buried in the Ground: it was fomewhat broken and damaged: I could
make but litrle of the Carving upon it, fince that was underneath, and
the Ear or Handle of the Orn lay upwards; wherefore, in order to
fee what it was, I began to clear the Ground away from it; but had

hardly dug a Foof deep, before I perceived a Piece of a Chariot, and
half a Wheel in the shape of a Star; this, I thought, muft be the
Charict of the Sun, as being not much unlike it.
This Work thus feeming old, and yet the Tomb with all ir's Orna-
ments as new as if juff fet up, I thought it muft have owed its Prefer-
vation to fome heavenly Infiuence. I was to entertained with viewing
it on all sides, that I was wholly taken up with it; without reffecting,
that as Fortune favoured me, I ought to haften to other Things of Con-
fequence before it grew too late; yet Irefolved, tho'1 fayed all Night,
not to leave the delicious Place before I had exactly deligned, in my
Pocket-book, every Thing remarkable in it. I then weat ten or twelve
Steps forwards from it, in order to have a full View of every Thing
thereabouts; and firting down, there opened a perfett Ordennance;
for, on feeing the Trees behind and on one Side of the decumbent
Nymph, and on the other Side an eaty Afcent with a fmall Cottage in
alow Ground behind it, I could not but obferve how elegant and be-
coming all the By-works kept themfelves. The Trees behind the
Tomb appeared dark, and thereby flung it off frong and brightly; the
Objects on each Side appearing faint. Further on, I dilcovered a imall
Bridge; and in the Offskip, fome Hills, C8c. all which I prefently
skeiched and shaded; marking for Shoriness of Time, with Letters or
Figures, the Colours of the Stones, and their Tints, together with the
Lighrnets and Darknets of one Object againft another, and alfo againft
the Skv.
Having done with this, and walking further on the right Hand, I
ame to a very large and weighty Bridge, of one Arcb, which had an
exceeding great Span ending, in the Crown, in a Point. This Opening
difcovered an even Plain, reaching almoft to the Horizon, with Cottages
and Houfes here and there, in a Village-like manner: They were not
meanly boarded and plaiftered like ours, but regularly built with
Stone, tho' plain and without Ornament. This Bridge came from be-
kind the Trees on the right Hand, and preferved a Communication
over the Rosd, with an high and large Rock on the Sea-thore: It was
poffibly placed here for the Sake of a dry Pallage to the other Side in
cale of Floods.
Going under this Arch, I found myfelf in the open Field, near an-
other fort of common Buildings, which, at a Dittance, I could not per-
ceive, on Account of some intervening Trees. Thele were Herdfmen's
Hatirations, and built with mean Marcrials, yet in a fine manner with
resped to Arc. Some food on Ground-fills, others went up rwo or

with circular Windows over
the Ground. Some hid fquare Doors,
them; of eife round Frames, Ruck infteed of Bastrelief, with
Rams, Or, or Gosts Sculls, cut in white Stone, according
to the Condition of the Inhabitant. The lower Windows were in
Form like the Deors, and a Dismeter and half higher than wide; or
elle, twice the Brealth in Height. The upper Windows of fuch as
had two Stories of fall Garrets, were moftly round. Some but fingle.
ftoried, hil Craipats-herded Doorways; and over them, long Octan-
gular Wirdows; and if ary fnaller over them, they were square. The
Roots were generally ffittilk, and tiled for bringing off the Water for-
wares. Some, in my Opinior, much excelled others in Grace; having
over the Doorways, fnall Baiconies with Compats-doors into them,
and the Wincows on each Side (quare and equally high; and over them,
roted ones again. On each Side of the aforefaid Doors or Entrances,
were made in the Walls, (quare Vent-holes, like Niches contracting in-
wardly, and cross-barred with Iron. The Pediments were Doric or
lonir, and of whirith Stone; the lower Story grey, and the rell Free
fone; tome were painted light-reddith, others white Free-ftone or grey.
Some Doors had Pillars or Seatson each Side. Some Houfes I faw allo
joined with Walls, wherein were round Holes. Here and there ap.
peared large Gates, as of Neat-houfes; one was open, and feemed to be
like a Place covered in; moff of the Windows had wooden Shutters,
which hinged on Top, and kept open by Sticks. Thofe Houfes, to
secure them from the Overflow of the River running in the Neigh
bourhood, ffoed much above the Level of the Way. In fine, Lomit-
red no Remarkable relaring to thofe Country Peoples manner of Duel

Somewhat further, and without this Villige, I came up to a round
Temple, having a lofcy and elegant Fronrifpiece. It was afcended by a
Flight of ten or twelve Steps, with a Free-ftone Balluffrade on each
Side, adorned with two Sphinxes, facing each other, which were head
ed with Caps and bodied with Houlings or Coverings, after the An.
tigue Manner. Landing on thefe Steps, I came up to a Portico, front
ed with eight Columns, Entabiature and Pediment of the Lonic Order;
the Pediment had a fine intire Bats-relief, not much rifing. The Co
lamns were continued round the Temple, twoand two together, refting
ORR Plinths and Bafements.
Over their Ornaments ran a Gallery, divided into Parts by Pedeftal,
whereon fford fine Statues, one antwering each Pillar. Behind the

Tho' 1 was not much converfant with Archicelture, :yet I perceived
a very regular Difposition in this Building, which, among thefe adjoin
ing, alfo orderly and beautiful, lofcily and magnificently diffinguished
itfelf; appearing like a precious Stone fet in Enamel, tho' neither had
other Ornaments, than fimply thofe of the Order.. The contiguous
Houfes were low and excenfive; with high Chimnies of Towers yield
ing, in my Opinion, ia fine Decorum. Behind thefe food a clofe Plan-
tation of Trees, moftly Pines and Cypreffes, which added no small
Luflre to all this Stone-work. On each side of the beforementioned
Steps was a Fountain or square Bason, adorned with two pretty large
Lioneffes, couching on Pedeftals and (pouring Water.
Thus I fancied 1 faw this glorious, lofty, and elpecially Painter-like
Sight: When we come to treat of Architeffure, and the Choice of
Reauty, within doers, I shall be at the Trouble of Repping inco this
Temple to delcribe ius inward Wenders.
Oh! How comfortable is the Shore after a Tempelt! What a Dif-
ference is there between a lovely Sun-fhine and a gloomy Night! Be-
tween froth and lively Vouth and Hale old Agel Love folaces in Gar-
dens of Pleafure and beautiful Palaces; but Enny lurks in defolate
Wilderneffes, among the Rubbith of Things which it defaces. Aban-
don then, true and young Arciftsl your blind Zeal; Beoury does not
triumph, nor is here attended with what is deformed; speited, souled or
broken, but takes up with Things fimple, ariless beautiful withour De-

much as the verdant and delightful Summer, and the dry and barren
Winter. Who, in building for Plcafure, would make a Patch: Or,
in making a Garden, fill it with half rorten Trees? He mull be an un-

nd the finest Things in the Wirldto introduce into oir Pieces: When I
have such a fine Parcel as that Piece of a Celumn, and this Water before
me, with the Addition of a Stump of a Tree, and a small dark Ofship
behind it, they tagether immediately compose a perfett Ordennance. Obl
you sannot imafine, hore extraordinary and sull of Variety these: Objects
are. Thisus the fineft Plate on Earth for a curious Arrift: All is Pointer-
like Every Thing ties so loose, pretty and wild, that few good Maffers
would refuse coming bither to defiyn these Wenders; and nothing but the
present high Wind binders their being here now. Upon this Praule, I
viewed him from Top to Toe; he farall in an Heap, with a Board in
his Lap; and a fmall ink-horn, and a magnifying or Spectacle glats in
his Hand; on his flead he had a Night cap almoff down to his Eves,
with his left Leg over his Hlat, poftibly to fave it from the Wind; a
small Light, coming from between the Trees, thone on his Lap. Poor
Man! thought I, horw feelingly you can talk of what is Painter-like; and
what Satisfartion you muft find in thofe things; if there be any more Artifts
of your Stamp, this must be the place ro find them in. The Truth is, dhre thore
Iviewed him and heard his Talk, the more I blamed my own Judg
ment fornot difcovering fuch Beauties as he did. Now, perceiving he had
done, I went towards him to fee his Work; but before I could come up
to him, he had packed up his Alls, and was gone another Way. Behind
the Trees, near the Place where he had been firting, I found another
Spark, who ftood and drew after a small Rivalet fult of bio and littfe
Clods of Earth and Pebbles; which he neatly detigned on Drawing-pa
per, and marked with their different Colours. His whole Porcofolio
was full of fuch Painter-like Trumpery; fuch as, muddy Water, decay-
ed and broken Stones, Picces of Wood, barren Shrubs and Busbes, rough
Grounds, Toads, Snakes, Ecc. I asking him, What Branch he made
his Study? He antwered, that he had not yet prattifed any; but hoped,
if he could get all thofe Things, and perform them well, to become a
good Landskip-painter; for, laid he, those Objects are souncemmon, that
the beft Mafters give themfelves the Treable to jeck them But, cominued
he, I cannot but wander, that some fearch here and in other Places, and
can fcarel find a Piece to their Gedt, nay, often return without doint
any Thing; when I, on the centrary, difeiver a thoufand Things, borb

was strange, any Man should run about in Error in to wild and defolate
2 Place.
Going on, I came to a large and bideous Rock, fplit through, and hav-
ing one Part hanging forward full of Charp Angles, open Hollows and
Curs, over run, hereand there, with Mots and barren Shrubs On the
right side, was a deep moraffy Valley, going off very feep, and on
the left appeared an inacceffible rained Burlding, like an Heap of Stone,
Twarming with Adders, Smakes and other venomous Creatures: Behind
me the Ground was to uneven, full of Ops and Downs, and pathless,
that I thought it impoftible to get from the Place. On the Point of
returning back, 1 faw a Man creep, on all four, out of one of the
Holes or Hollows of the Rock, and thereby cleared a Paffage for me.
This Man told me what wonderful Things were to be feen on the other
Side; but I was fcarce crept half through, before I heard a frightful
Thunder-clap, which thook the whole Rock; wherefore, redoubling my
Speed, and being got through, I found, that the Top of the Rock was
tumbled over the right side; which made me fuddenly recire from
theme, fearful char another Part might fall upon me. What allo raited
my Avertion, was, the Sight of a lomb crassed to Pieces, and almott
funk into the Ground; and near it, lying a Piece of a lorge Trunk, of
whice Marble. I could perceive, by the Bafe, that it had been a
Torm; and being curious to know, what might be hidden behind it, I
got on the Tomb, and faw, through the Trees, downwards a frightful
Pool I therefore took to the left; where I thought the Ground was
more level: Three or four Steps from thence, f law a white Paper
Hintering before me along the Ground; and after it a Blue one, fome-
what larger; both which Iranafter and took up. The biue Paper ap.
peared to be a Drawing after the aforefaid Tomb, when intire and
Handing, which made me judge, that he muft have been a good Maf
ter who had thus improved it in the Draught. Poffibly, thought 1, he
is hereabouts My Conjecture was not groundless; for, flepping a little
further, I found the poor Wreech lying under a large Oat which had
been thunder-ftruck; the Stem was cleft from Top to Bottom, and a
large Limb lay acrots the Mans Body: His Porto folio lry near him,
emptied of all his Drawings T his Sight affrighted me; and approach
ing near, I heard him ligh: He, perceiving me, called out prefencly
for Help: I cleared the Limb from off his Body as well as I could;
whereby, and after much Pains, he ditengaged himself from the Leaves.
He was, to my Wonder, no where hurt, lave a little in his left Hand,
yet of no Contequence. I recurned him his Papers, and asked him,
Whether

Whether he had feen the Tomb in the Condicion wherein Twas drawn?
He antwered, he had: When, goins to thew it to me, he, in Amare
ment, ftarced back on finding it in Ruins. Ob! fays he, does this lye
also tumbled down, and my Drowing scarce finished! We then went to-
gether fixther up, towards the left, and regained moft of his Papers
He fold me, that his Companion had left him, and run away on the
Approach of the Scorm; which induced me to think, he was the Per-
fon who came creeping on all four through the aforefaid Hole. On our
coming down, we found many already drawing after the broten Tree un
der which the good Man had lain, with the uimoff Application; Twas
their unanimous Opinion, never to have feen a Tree more Painter-like.
This talk furprized us both. He shewed them his Drawing, and faid,
that the Tomb was the only Object he found intire thereabouts; and,
this being demolithed, there was nothing left to pleafe him. But this
they fcoffed at and anfwered him, that fuch Things might eafily be
made out of one's Head, or found in Prints. In thort, Twas great Di-
verfion to me to fee one as horly clambering up one Place, and another
creeping through fome Hole, for the fake of deligning the Rock and
Tombrumbled down, as if they were going after 1 reature.
Taking Leave of this Perfon, I purfued my Way: But was obliged,
for the take of a ruinous Fountain, the Vafes, Mouldings and other Or-
naments whereof lay across and slopped the Way, to take to the right
Hand. On the Remains, adorned with Bals relief, I found not one in-
tire Figure, every thing being exceffively mouldered, fouled and over
run with wild Plants and Shrubs. 1is Bafon lay awry, with a Cormer
funk into the Ground, broken and full of Earth or Mud. A Boy, who
had been fitting there, came and asked me, Whether I could not tell
him, which Part of this Heap of Stones was the moft Painter like? I
have been long making a Charce, lays he, of fomething good out of it, but
the Number confounds me; the Parts are all so broken that I cannot find
to much as a whole Hand or Foot: I have, thewing me his Drawing.
pitched upon this amang them, with much ado. I believe verily, there
was not fuch another undamaged Bit in the whole Ruin, tho' of little
Confequence: It was a Plinth with the right Leg and Foot of Apollo;
Wanting the great Toe. He faid, that he, with eight or ten others,
had been drawing every thing after the Heap, except this Frigment;
the Foot of which was not, according to their Fancies, broken enough.
I comforted him with faying, that he had pibked our the ivery belt thing
of all, when he owned, that he made the Choice through the Perfua=
fion of another, who was now gone away, to whom the Leg, by
means

mears of the Sandal and Straps, was not unknown. This Boy, I
thought, ought to be fet in a right Way; and his simplicity pleafed
IIc.
Turning then to the right Hand, as I have faid, I came into a dif
mal Place, which, by the Largencts of the Pavement, and Arch-work
tupported by great Pillars, feemed formerly to have been a Palace. It
was here to lonefome and gaftly, that I was feized with a cold Sweat;
wherefore I mended my Pace, in order to get out of it, and being got
to the other side, and ten or twelve Paces from it, I found myfelf again
at the Lake before mentioned; near which lay a shattered Tomb,
with the Corps half tumbled out. The Head and one Arm refted on
a large Root of a Tree lying near it ; the Lid was almoff flid off, and
juft on the Totter; and a Smake, from undermeath, was creeping into the
Tomb! A Sight frightful enough.
The Sun, now on the Point of fetting, darted his refulgent Rays
between some heavy Clouds; the Sty was moreover dark Blue, and on
the Horizon yellowith -striped; which, along through the Trees, Arongly
glirtered in my Eyes I faw a grave Man carefully defigning this Sky
in Colours. in pafting by, I faid to him, — Sir, you bave met
with a fine Sight; thats a true Italian Sky. Ves; fays he, I am very
sonsible of it. _ Stepping further, 1 heard another Thunderclap;
and the Tempell increafed: Which obliged him to pack up his
Toals, and go off, and made me refolve to be at Home before
Night
Now, I leave it to the Judgment of the Knowing and judicious
Lovers, to decermine, which of my two Reprefentations is to be ac
counted Paister-life? I have fufficienly exprefted my Sentiments touch
ing them. But it is to be lamented, that Tyres, in their youthful Ar
dour, are infected with this Poiton; and made to believe, that in Ibun
der and formy Weather they muft run abroad, to defign such Mischantes
and Defefts of Nature, at the Hazard of their Healths and Lives;

yourg Batfer, and others, who, tho' poftiffed of great Talents in the
Art, poltponed what is noble and beautiful, for what is mere ordina-
1y and common. The Truth is, and we have feen, that fooner by
this Means than othrers, Men have obtained the Honour of gold Mc-
dals and Chains, 65r. Nay, the Liberty of prescribing Laws to Prin-
ces; flaring them in the Face; drawing their Piltures, and many o

unheard of Reward did not Apelles receive, when Alexander gave him
his dear Campaspe, in order to fave the Life of that great Arcill, by
latisfying his Love, inflamed by drawing the Picture of that Beauty t
When I confider thefe Things I am furprized, that all Painters do not
give in wholly to Portraiture; fince now a days Money is preferred to
aearning, Lucre to Virtue, and Honours dispented to Men in Propor-
tion to their Riches. But, leaving this Subjelt, we will proceed
throughly to confider every thing relating to that Branch of the
Att.
As in Mutick and Singing a good Ear is requifite, to in Portraiture
iis impostible to excel without a good Eye; fuch an one, 1 mean, as
is poverned by fedate and fober Senfation, and not by Self-love of
Palfion Next, is required a regufar Defgs, containing an exact Pro-
portion of Divition of the Parts, not only of the Face, but of the
whole Body, that the Sitter may be known by his Pilture; which
may be moft agreeably done by mmixing the Fashich with what is Paint-
ortike; as the great Lely did, and which is called the Painterlike of
antique Manner, but by the ignorant Commonalry, the Roman Man-
DCT.
Next, we mult be thoroughly judicious in the graceful Choice of the
Light, and the Place where the Perfon is to fit, that the Face may
appear to the beft Advantage; and then the Body is to be difpoted to
the moft natural and becoming Pesture.
The next Bulinets, and which gives it the greateff Luftre, is, the
Colouring; that each Perfon and his Parts may have their preper Cor
Bur, atid fuch as appears in his daily Converfe, not fuch as proceeds
from extraordihary Emotions. Let the Arciff beware of inclining to
any particular Manner, like fome, whofe Work is thereby better
known to be theirs, than the Friends of the Sitter know the Pictun

to be his.
As for the Chostr of Light, in order to apply it moft advanidgiont
ly for the Benefit of either Sex, irs certainly a Matter of great Mo

ment; fince the fair Sex commonly partake of more Delicacy and
Grace than Men, to they muft have a Light as beautiful and agreea-
ble as their Perfons.
But tere we proceed further, it will not be improper to look into
the Origin of Pertraits, in order thereby to thew the Aim of thofe
who caufe themfelves to be drawn, and the Profirs which Mafters get
thereby.
The Ancients uted to caule thofe, from whom the Common-wealth
had received extraordinary Benefits, either in War or civil Affairs, or
for Eminence in Religion, to be reprefented in Marble or Metal, or
in a Pilture, that the Sight of them, by thofe Honours, might be a
Spur to Pofterity to emulate the fame Virtues. This Honour was firft
begiun with their Deities; afterwards it was paid to Heroes, and of
confequence to Philosephers, Oraters, religious Men, and others, not
only to perpecuace their Virtues, but allo to emhalm their Names and
Memories. But now it goes further; a Perfon of any Condition whar
foever, have he but as much Money as the Painter asks, muft fit for
his Picture; this is a great Abufe, and fprung from as laudable a
Cante.
in Noblemes indeed is a very commendable Cultom; becaute, be
ing defcended from great Families, the Luflre of thefe ought to thine,
to encourage their succeffors to keep up their Glory, and to prevent
fullying it by unworthy Actions.
As for 2 General, of Admiral, who has died in the Bed of Honour,
Gratitude, I think, obliges us to raife a Monument to his Glory,
and to animate brave Souls in fucure Times, to imitate his Virtue.
But whats this to the Vulgar; Pride only fpurs them to it. The
Rich do it, that their Children may boaft of it; the Mafter of a nume-
jous Family does it, that the World may know he is a Father; be
who has fired a Magazine of the Enemy muft be drawn, with this
great Action, tho' perhaps there was no body to hinder him. Has a
Ctizen's Wife but an only Babe, he is drawn at half a Vear old; at
ten Vears old he fits again, and for the laft Time in his twenty fitth
Year, in order to thew her tender Folly; and then the flands wonder
ing how a Man can to alter in that Time; is not this a weighty Rea
fon! A reproveable Cultom, if Painters did not gain by it. But 2
gain, Portraits are allowable, when a Lover is ablent from his Miftrels,
that they may find each other their Piltures, to cherifh and increate
their Loves; a Man and Wife to parted may do the fame

But to return to the original Matter; I muft warn the Artifts not to
give in too much to what is common; or humour ignorant People to
much, as not to referve to themfelves some Liberty of doing what
they think proper for the fake of Reputation: Surely, this cannot be
Rrange Advice; for a Mafter, who prefers Money before Art, has no
more dangerous a Rock to (plit on, lince the ignorant Multitude ufually
infiff to be drawn according to their own Whims. One fays to a good
Matter, — Draw me thus or thus; let me have one Hand on my Breaft,
and the other on a Table; another mult have a Flower in his Hand, or
a Flower-pot mult be by him; another muft have a Dog, or other
Creature, in his Lap; another will have his Face turned this or that
Way; and fome, who would be drawn in the Reman Manner, muft
be fet off by a Globe or Clock on a. Table, whether fuch Ornaments
be proper, or not: On mentioning the Reman Manner, I find that it
fignifies, a loofe, airy Undress, fomewhat favouring of the Mode, but
in no wife agreeing with the ancient Roman Habit.
But many other Inconveniencies attend Portraiture; as firft, the Ig.
porance of thofe who fit; for fome of them, having no right Notion of
their own Mien and Shape, often refer the judgment of a. fine Por-
trait to the Eye of a Child, or Servant; and what they fay, Monficur
and Madame believe, either to its Praife, or Difcommendation.
A second Inconveniency arifes from a wedded Inclination which any
one has to fuch and fuch Objects; judging, as they like or diflike, not
only of Pictures, but even the Life wtelf; for, tho' they may be
afraid to pass Sentence on a fine Hiffory, or Landskip, yet a Por-
trail mult not efcape them, as thinking it within the Reach of their
Capacities.
Thirdly, we find many Artifts never pleafed with other Mers
Works, but, being full of themfelves, delpife every thing they fee
tho' as good as their own; and this perhaps on no better Bortom, than
2. Pique againtt the Arciffs Converlation, Talk, Dress or Money; or
elfe becaule of his greater Fame and yet, if ten Perfons happen to
appland a fine Pilture of this Eye-fore Mafter, they will, at that
Juncture, chime in with them, to fereen their Prejudice. And, on the
contrary, if but a fingle Perfon afterwards find fault, they immediate-
ly turn the Tables againtl ten others. Again, if a Piece of their
Friend be brought on the Carper, tho' never to faulty, they will ap
pland and jullity it at any rate, tho' againft their own Convictions of
Confcience. But this partial and prejudiced Humour is moft prevalent
in thofe who know leall.

A fourth Set of Men are thofe, who, being always of an uneaty
Temper, diflike their own, but appland every thing other Men do:
Thele indeed are not to noxious as the former; becaute they only hure
themfelves, whereas the others hurt every body.
Fifthly, there are a prejudiced Set of Men who find no Talle, but
in ealy and grave Airs and Poftures; others in firring and hurrying
ones; others in ftrong and violent ones; fome think, that Womens

ver or Sattin, or elfe parre-coloured; this thinks, that a dark or brown
Ground beft fets off a Figure; another chules a Landskip, of green
Certain, right or wrong. Are the Colours beautifully cholen, the Pic-
cure fmells of them; are they broken, they feem muddy and foul.
How can a Portrait pleafe to many Opinions! It is not like an Hiftory
full of Figures, where we can introduce Variety of fedate and firring
Action, more or less beautiful Colouring, loofe or fet Draperies, dark
or light Grounds, coc. Becaule this is but a fingle Figure.
Our Bufincts then, muft be to find a Way between this Soylla and
Cbarybdis, to enable the Artiff to paint a good Portrait; for he who
makes due Reffection on every thing, can prepare himself to overcome
the aforefaid Difficulties
C H AP. II. Of the Defetts in the Face and other Parts.
HE Defects which are feen in Nature, or in fimple Life, are
threefold.
1. Natural ones.
2. Accidental ones.
2. Usual ones.
The Noturalones are, a wry Face, fquint Eyes, wry Mouth, Nofe,
C0.
The Accidental ones are, Loss of an Eye, a Cut on the Cheek or o
ther Part of the Face; Pies of the Small-pox, and the like.
The Usual ones are, thofe Habits to which we accultom ourfelves
from our Infancy; to wit, Contraction of the Eyes and Mouth, of
Cloting of Gaping of the latter, or drawing it in fomewhat to this or
that side, upwards or downwards, Cec.
As for other bodily Infirmities, how many have wry Necks, Hunch-
backs, Bandy-legs, withered or thort rms, of one Chorter than the
other;

other; dead or lame Hands or Fingers? Among thefe, some are una-
voidable; and others may be either left our, or handfomely hidden.
The Neceffary ones ought to be feen, becaute they belp the Likeness;
tuch as a wry Face, fquint Eyes, low Fore-head, Thinnels and Fatnels,
a wry Neck, too fhort or long a Nofe, Wrinkles between the Eyes,
Ruddiness or Palenets of the Cheeks, or Lips, Pimples or Warts a-
bout the Mouth; and fuch like; among thofe which may be bidden
or left out, I count a blind Eye, a Wound, Wen, Mole, Pies of Small-
pox, too many Pimples, Coc. a red, blue, or hairy Spot; as allo
habicual Ulages; fuch as hanging Lips, Pinchings of Drawings of
the Mouth and Eyes.
I think allo, that the common and usual Dress of a Perton is a great
Addition to Likeness for no fooner is the Dress altered, but the Look
does the fame, and thews itfelf either more or lets pleating and agree-
able; and thereby the Perfon becomes more or less known: To obvi-
ate which, I advife the Artiff above all things to get firft a true Like-
ness of the Face, and paint it to the Sitter's Satisfaction; and then he
may freely manage all the reft as he thinks fit, and thereby get Ho-
nour and Commendation; fince the Life itfelf, in fuch a Drels, cannot
any more alter.
The Painter should likewife dilcover and know, as much as poffible,
the Natare and Temper of the Perfon fitting, and in what Circum-
Rances lies his favourite Pleafure; that he may, when fitting, be en-
certained with Talk pleating to him, and his Air thereby kept fteady
and ferene, and his Pofture natural and eaty; avoiding every thing
tending towards Sorrow, or frightful Relanons; for thefe are apt to
ruffie the Mind, and to to difcompofe the Face, that it cannot eafily
be got right again: But if the Sitter himself do, by his Talk, difco
ver his own Bent, the Painter ought to humour it to the laft, whether
it be jocofe or moderate, without Exaggeration of Diminution; yet
with luch a Variety, as not to prove tirefome, and make the Face al.
ter. He who cannot thus manage and furnith out a Difcourfe, will be
the longer ere he hit the Likeness: Some will even fit three or four
Times, and each Time with a different Air; and were they to fit ten
Times, I fancy fomething new would still offer.
Another Hindrance may be, that Painting-rooms are often hung
with fuch finutty Piltures as frequencly put Virgins to the Blnth, or
alter their Countenances. But tho', for Improvement, fine Pittures are
neceffary to be always in View, yet, in a Painting room, there ought
not to hang the wanton Pilture of Mars and Venus catch’d by Vulcan;

or Diana’s Bothing, tho' done by Van Dyk; or feseph and Potiphar's
Wife; for tho' thefe may hang in a Corner, yet when the Eye has
once carched them, it will retain them; becaute their ideas make con-
tinual Impreftions on the Mind, even againtl its Will; and therefore
the bare Remembrance of fuch Things muft put 2 young and chafle
Virgin to the Bluth. Mult it not create a Longing, to fee a Picture of
two Besgar-boys fall greedily on ripe Fruit, the one eagerly biting a
Piece of freth Melon, and the other, a Bunch of Grapes, with the
Jnice falling down his Chin on his naked Breaft? The Room then
should be hung with every thing modell, as fine Landskips and Flow.

come great.
We will now proceed to confider, how many Millakes fome Painters
commit in relation to the firff Obfervation of natural Defetts; thefe
endearour, to their utmoft Power, to exprets punctually the Deformities
and Defelts of a Face, without Scruple, to wit, a blind of fquint Eye,
or the like, tho' they know that tis an Enemy to Grace, and on no
other Ground than a falfe Belief that it creates a greater Likeness
But who loves to be reproached with his Defects, when they can be
artfully hidden? What would become of Grace: which reaches, that a
Painter should make as beautiful a Choice as poftible; which thefe ble
mithes obfcure: I think therefore, that we cannor lay too great a Stress
on what concerns the Make, Posstion and Turn of a Face, that the Eye
be not offended with Blemith, or Deformity, or the Posture look dify-
freeable.
How monlrous is the Picture of a certain Admiral, who seems to
ftab himself with his Staff of Command, and has a defective Eye turn
ed directly to the Light; becaute, according to the Saying, he is bet
Known by it: Would not a more Profile-view have fixted him better,
or to have fiung the Side with the blind Eye into Shade? Would it not
be ridiculous to paint the Duke of Lnxemburgh in Profile, to reprefent
him the becter, and that his Hunch -back might be the more vifible,
for no other Reaton, than that moft People knew he had one?

Nature abhors Deformity, and we cannot behold it without Averfi-
on, and a quick Tun of the Eye from it; a squint eyed Perfon cannot
see himself in a Glass without inward Trouble; especially one of the
fair Sex, who, in other respects tolerably handsome, cannot bear to
fee an laftance of her Deformity in another, but will bathfully look off
a
or down to the Ground; how much worle then mult it look in a Pic
ture? The Life may be fometimes feen on an handlome Side; which,
in an ill cholen Picture, we can never expect: Whence it's natural for
one, who has a Blemith or Defect in an Eye or Check, always to turn
the bell side to the Light; in thort, we do not defire to do any Thing,
walk, fland, fit, talk, but with a becoming Air Have we fore Eyes,
we hide them under our Hlats; or if a lame Hlip, we endeavour to walk
briskly; have we some Humour or Pimples in a Cheek, we either hide
them with a Paich, or paint the other Side like it; have we bad Teeth,
we keep the Mouth thut; or a lame Hland, and hide it not under our
Coats, of in our Pockets. If Naturealts fo, how can fuch Defects pleafe
in a Picture? Such a Flartery then, as is agreeable to Art; is not only
allowable, but commendable, efpecially when the Sitter is to dispoted
in Pofture that the Painter himself cannot perceive it.
Ask any one who wears a Piece of black Silk over an hollow Eve,
whether he defires to be drawn from that side; I believe not: A Per-
ton with a wooden Leg cares not that the Deformity should appear in
a Pilture; fuchi an one ought to be drawn in half Length only; but if
the Heroe inift upon the introducing fuch a Leg, on a Suppofition
that is an Honour to have loft a Limb in his Country's Service, the
Painter mult then comply with his Defires; or elle contrive it lying on
a Table covered with red Velvet : if he defire it after the Anique
Manner, it muft be contrived in a Bats-relief; wherein the Occation af
it may be reprefented; or it may hang near him on a Wall, with its
Buckles and Straps, as is done in Hantingiequipages; of elfe it may
be placed among the Ornamehnts of Archirelture, to be more in View:
But what Praife or Advantage will an Arciff get by this, when a judi-
cious Mafter fees the Picture! He may verhaps plead in Excute, that
the Sitter would have it fo: This indeed I cannot argue againft; becaute
we afually: fay-to whom we employ, .—Do as I would have you
right or wrong: We have an inftance of a Gentleman; whe, being

C H A P. III. The Obfervables in a Pertrait, particularly that of a
Woman
VEL F.CONCEl Tand Selflove seem narural to all, but efpe.
I cially to the Female Sex; who, whether their Pictures are drawn

on their own Accounts, or through the Defire of others, imagine
ther deferve fuch Homage; nor ftops it here, for altho' they may
poffess a colerable Share of Beauty, yet that's not fatisfaltory enough;
they muff be ffaccered, and their Pictures painted in the moft beauti-
ful Light; and unhappy is the Painter who abates but half a Dram of
fuch a Beautr.
For thefe Reafons the Maffer is obliged to have a principal Regard
to Light and Coloar; but to the Light chiefy, fince its well known
that mothing gives greater Offence to ignorant People than Shades, and
sill more, when they are Rrong and broad: They believe they (peak
to the Purpofe in objecting, — Well, how can it be poffible that my
Nock and Check should have firch large shades; when I daily confult
Hiy Glass, and find my Skin all ofa Colour and White? And they the
Painter is blained: But are not fuch Reafons weak and abfurd? Since
if a Man, how tenacious foever, meet another; who, by long Abfence
and Alteration of Drefs, is got ort of his Memory, he will naturally
forn him to the Light, in order to know him and his Features. This
Condolt has been wonderfully obferved by Baroces in his Picture of
Mary, paying a Vific to Elizabert when big with Child; in which, by
his Method of placing the Figures, and the Accention of the Faces,
we teem to hear them talk, looking earneftly at each other.
 Ithink thote Mafters have hads the beft. Choice, who have cholen
a Frot-tgbs, and thereby kepr their Colours moft natural and beau
tful; fince this Light is certainly moft advantageous, whether the
Pilture hang againtt a Wall, or where elfe: But here feems to arife
a Difficulry, fnce we formerly faid that we eught to fix a certain

traits have no fixed Place; as we shall further thew in another Chap
ter; as alfo how far and on what Occafions we muft confine ourfelves
to that Rule.
The beft way to fettle this Point is, to follow thole who have chof
en their Light almost frenting, and, as before faid, such a Colour-
ing as naturally appears to the Eye, belides a good Choice: SinceI chink
the Cafe of placing a Portrait to be the fame, as that of curious Cbi-
ns. which, whether it fland high or low, thew itself every where beau
tiful. My Reafon for this is, that Objects, which have fuch a Front-
light, have an exceeding, fine Effect, and p ear Relief, when they come
againft a dark Ground; and hill finer, when the Light falls on them
somewhat from on high, if the Sitter and fome Accidents do not hinder
it; in which Cafe, Reafon and our Eye mult beft direct us. View
but this Finels in a Pofture painted leaning over an Harch, or out at
Window, and what great Decorum the Touches and Shades about the
moft relieved Parts caule in fuch an Object; as Leonarde da Vinci has
well obferved.
Of the Accidents, which I juft now spoke of, I shall mention two
of three; fome Perfons may be too long and charp-nofed, or too hol-
low-eyed; for fuch a low Light is moft proper; but where tis other-
wife, an high Light. In this Manner a judicious Mafter ought to help
the Defects of Nature, without adding to, or taking any thing from
them: Vet, to the Sorrow of impartial Malters, the contrary is too
much feen; for, as I have faid, that Hiffory-painters chule and follow
what they have the greateft inclination for, to it is with many Portrait-
painters, their Work is better Known by their particular Manner,
than the Sitter by his Picture.
Permit me here to make a Comparifon between thofe two great
Malters, Titian and Van Dyk, with respect to the Judgment 1 have
heard made on their Works: Of the latter it's faid, that in the
Delign, Grace and Choice of a Portrait figure he was the moft skilful;
nevertheless Pye feen many of Titians (who, in moft Men's Opinions,
has the greater Reputation) which feemed to me incomparable, tho'
lets agreeable: Here my Polition, about the particular Choice of
Mafters, takes effect again; becaute I think, that the Defect in, A.
greeableness is peculiar to Titidn's Country, and limits his Choice,
and therefore he is the lels culpable; when, on the contrary,
our Region prefers what is gay and elegant, before the majeitic and
grave; and Likeness is the chief Object both of the Sitter and the
Arciff, every thing: elfe being looked or as By-works and Ornament:

A poor Judgment methinks of People of Senfel For if a Portrail have
not, befides Likeness, an agreeable Difposition, the little Knowledge
of the Mafter will prefently appear. Iis true, that we meet with ma-
y odd Faces in the Life, especially among vulgar and clownith Peo-
ple, yet 1 fay, that, be they ever fo rude, Agreeableness should be ob-
served in their Piltures. By fgreeubleness I underftand the Difposition.
of a Posture in general; as when the Face has an advantageous Turn
more or lets to the Light, up or down, in order to create handfome
Shades, and to thun unbecoming ones; for every Face requires a parti-
cular Obfervation; one, an high Light, another, a low one; this a
Side-light; that, an almoft fronting one: I fpeak not yer of many o
ther Requifites, fuch as the Sway of the Neck, Shoulders or Breaff;
or of a proper Back ground; all which Confiderations are effential to a
fine Portrait, as well in respect to the Naturalnets and Colour, as to the
Motion: But of the Light and Back-grounds we shall fay more in the
sext Chapter, and now return to our Comparifon. Some think that
Von Dyks Pamtings are but Watercolours, compared with Titians,
whofe Pitures have to much Force in Colouring, Lights and Shades,
that those of the other cannot fland in Compecition with them, nay,
that his Colouring is inimitable, and whereby that of Van Dyf ap-
pears faint and weak: A ridiculous Opinion indeed! However, that
Vax Dyk and Tirian differ much in Colouring, I allow; but neverthe-
tets think, that we need not run to the Iations to prove it, fince, if
the Stress lay in frong Colouring only, Rembrant need not give way
to Titias: But whence arifes the Miltake ? Moft Men chime in with
thofe fimple Judges who approve no Hiffories, Landskips, or Portrails,
that are not painted in the Iralian Manner. My Opinion is, that the
whole Marter lies more in the Difference of Climates, than in the
Handlings of the Matters; for let an Englifsmans Piture hang near
an Iabias's, both handled with equal Skill, and each reprefented ac
cording to his Hue and Nature, there will appear a great Difference
between them; the (weetening Sofinets of the Englishmon will charm
as much on one Hand, as the flrong and glowing Colour of the Iation
on the other: On which now of thefe two Pictures has the Mafter be.
flowed the moff Pains? re not both Praife worthy, as having each
expreffed the Charaffer natural to his Figure?
But pot to go abroad for Comparifons, with respect to particular
Climes, our own Netberland affords Differences enough: Two Brothers
of the fame Parents are born in the fame Town and Hour; one of
them is brought up to the Sword, and endures all the Facigues of

becomes fwarthy. The other Brother, contrarily, is educated in Sa-
loons, fine partments and tender Converfacions, by which means,.
Time cannot to much affect him; each fits for his Picture, to a lepa-
tate and good Mafter: Now thefe two Pictures being brought toge
ther, will the Painter be cenfured for the Difference of Tints and Fea-
rures! Or will it be objected, that Narure has not been righily follow-
ed? Or that the Pictures are not like? An impartial judge will de-
termine that both are good and natural, and that each Mafter has due-
ly mixed Art with Nature.
I have difcovered a great Overlight in fome Artifls, which is, that
when the Face was finished, they had no further Regard to the Life.
but chofe a Pofture, at Pleafure, our of Drawings of Prints, without
confidering whether it faited the Perfon, and whether the Dress was
proper to the Condition and Countenance of the Sitter; nay, whether
the Head march’d the Body: Certainly, a great Heedlessness! For if a
Body mull be added, what more proper than the Life irself: And tho'
the Layman be good, and helpful, yet its not equal to the Life.
Many difregard this, thinking they have done enough in hirting
the Face: But all the while they are prepofteroutly joining an
airy Drapery to a fedate and grave Head, and a grave and fliff
Dress to a merry Face. But further, the Hands are intirely neg-
letted; if a Pair of fine ones can be got of some other Mafter, thefe
are made Ufe of, without Regard to the Life, which may per-
haps have hort, thick and coarfe Hlands: How can thefe Thingsagrec?
is it not almoff the same as to drels Florg with the Drapery of feffc, and
Vefta with Floras? rcifts lay.— We have the Prints of Van Dyk,
Lety, Kneller and others for fine Examples; and as Lely has followed
Van Dyk in graceful Action and Draperies, fo we have a Liberty to
imitate him, and others. — To which I willingly agree; but then
we ought to do it on the fame Footing as he did; in his Poltures he has
pot meerly, and without Alceration followed Vun Dif, and Killless
without judgment; as may be feen in his two celebrared Pictures of
Well Goynn and the Dof P—. The one, a wanton and bux-
om Lady, he has to reprefented; and the other, being a Widow, and
more fedate, appears more modefl.
By this Rule we muft walk in the Ufe of thofe great Mafters; but
if Things be done without making Dillinction of Perfons, and their
Conditions, the Arciff will work to his Dilhonour. He who fleals this,

Merchant or Citizen; Nobleman or Plebean: Hereby we shall difcover

rectly woin the mat rifing, or relieved Purts: But 1 thall now lubjoin,
that fince the Life, however we difpofe it, either from or near the
Light, fronting or in Protile, yer supports itfelf, tho' the Light be not
advantageouly cholen, which a Portrait cannot do; we therefore mutt
needs, in order to make if appear as it ought to be, accommodate the
Light to the Disposicion of the Face; for lnftance, when the Face turns
fomewhat fideways, the Light muft be adapted to it; when it's quite
in Protile, a Side light will be best, becaufe then a great Mass of Light
remains together, to wit, in the Forehead, Nofe and Cheeks, which
are not broken by any Groundthade, but united by the Roundnets;
which thews us how to reprefent rifing Narure, and caufes a becoming
Relief.
We fee that manr, without Difference, be the Figure in full Pro-
portion, or in Lrtle, give the Touches under the Nofe to black and
dark, that it teems as if a black Beetle were proceeding thence; where
asits certain, and Nature teaches it, that when the Light falls trong
on the Nofe, the Noffrils and their Ground-hades can never appear 1o
black; and yet fome think, they ve done great Fears in uling Force and
Strength, and will do it even in a fair and tender Face, and no bigget

Force enough to, shade the other Objects of a darker Colour, fuch as

Face leems to jump out of the Frame, and to defert the Wig, Hair and
Garment. We mult not to underfland, when we teach that the Face

Order, that it may look narural Each Colour of the By-work, ought,
according to it's Lightness or Darkness, to have it's moderate Shade and
dark Touches, as the Matter, it contifis of, is either folid, or thin and
tranfparent; and in Proportion as the Objects leffen, to mult the Force
of their Colours diminith, as shall be furcher illuftrated in the following
Chapter, to which for Brevity we refer: We fee an excellent Example
of this Management in the famous Nelfcbers artful Portraits, wherein
he has judicioutly handled the darkeff Shades, and -Touches,
according to the natural Ferce of the Colour.
For the better underftanding of further Obfervables, I have found it
proper to meation some other Particulars concerning the Dilpolition of
Lights, according to Occation, contilling in Light againft Dark, and the
centrary; and tho' every Thing thereby becomes relieved, and is fee
off, yet that is not fufficient; for the placing of Colours againtt eachr
other on suitable Grounds; and a Contraft in the Objects, whether move-
able or immoveable, is of great Confequence and Decorum: And al
tho' we have handled thefe Things at large in the Book of Colouring,
yet we find it neceffary, to recapiculate them here, with respect to Por-
traits, and the reciring Grounds or Viftos behind them.
Obferve then, whether a fair and beautiful Face will become a light
Grey, or lighrith blue Ground; and whether a warm Complexion and
Rrong Colouring againtt a glowing or yellowith Ground will pleafe the
Eye: I fpeak of the Face, not the Draperies, tho' both together make
a Portrall: But let the fair and beautifid Fuce of a Woman be placed.

ment; as fome by their glowing Shades and Rellexions have endeavour-
ed to do; whereby their Faces, on the shaded side, look as if a light-
ed Candle flood behind them, which penetrated their Skin: This is as
unnatural in the open Air, as within Doors.
This Example of a Woman is enough, to prove the contrary Coadntt
with respect to a Man's Face, according to the aforefaid Rules, couch-

ing the Dilpolition and placing of Colours on Tukable Orounds; famely,
that the ffrong ought to be painted againtt the weat, and the arak a.
gaind the glowing and frong; wherein is alfo comprehented hight againt
Dark, and Darkagaintl Light
Whence its evident, that Back-grounds contribuce very much to the
charming Grace of Objects; nay, Idare fay, that the Decorum thoftly
depends thereon: And tho' many imagine, that a dark of black Grond
always becomes a Portrait, yet 11s no Rule, fince, as before has been
Laid, each inlividaal Coloar of the Objetts requires a particular Back.
groand: Belides, it tuch Things were to be taken for Rules, the rt
would fmell too much of an Handicrafe; for a dark Colour againt a
dark Ground can have no good Effect, and that of a whice, or pale a
gainft it, will be too hard; therefore a Medium mult be pudicioutly ob-
ferved in bock, that one Colour may fuit with the other. in the Drage.
ries the Conduct is the fame; one Perfon beft becomes light; and another,
dark Cloths; Blue fuitsone, and Red, Vellow or Green, Cc. another:
The Arrit muft then take care not to force Nature, but help her as
much as poffible, and reprefent her alwars moft begutiful.
If any one would know my Reafon for thinking, that many Errors
arife in this Part of the Art, it is, That the Colours of the nated receive
more or lets, or too much Force by the By-colours of Grounds and
Eackornaments: It fares with them, as it is laid of the Camelion, who
changes his Colour as often as he is placed by different Colours; tho' this
is occationed by his elegant and thining Scales, when, contrarily, the
human Skin is dull and not fhining: However, we shall find, that he,
who paints a Portrait twice, and each Time on a contrary Ground, yet
with the fame Temperament of Colours, will perceive a very great,
nay, incredible Difference: As I have on feveral Occafions experiment
ed in the Life; to wit, That when some Virgins were in a Room hung
with Vellow, they looked fickly and grey, notwithflanding their freth
Colour; but contrarily, being in a Room hung with Violet, their Co.
lours thewed themfelves very beautiful; whence it appears that the Al.
terations are offentimes occafioned by the adjacent Objects: Let him,
who doubts this, make Trial of it in a Portrait, by laying a Ground,
with Watercolours, on Paper, and after the Face is cut out, placing it
againft the Picture intlead of a Back-ground. But, I think, there is a
conveniet Way of preventing the aforefaid lceration; namely, by
fixing againft the Wall, behind the Sitter, a Garment, Cloth or fome
thing elle of the fame Colour, of near it, which we chufe for our Bick-
ground:

ground: Thurrwe may be fire of hitting the right Colour, and make
the Painting look agresable
in order to repreient an extentive Back-ground, and chieffy in a small
Picture, be it an Apartment, or Landskip, some Sbadiness should be con-
rived between the Figure and the Diltance, as a Column, Curtain, Body
of a Tree, Vale, Coc. Thete Objects being in Shade, or of a dark Co-
lour, the Lights falling on the Off-works, will not prejudice either the
Faceor Drapery; tho' both be light; but on the contrary, the Figure..
as receiving the foremoll and greatelt Light, will thereby be relieved,
and look more agreeable.
As for the Drageries, fince they confill of different and various Co
lours, each of a particular. Narure, and little agreeing with the Co
lour of the Face, they alfo require each a particular Ground, beft
fairing and unicing with it; to the end that, tho' differing among them.
felves, they may have a perfett Harmony with each other,, to that the
Eye be not taken alone with the Face, or the Draperies, Ornaments.
or By-works; but, by this fweet Conjunction, infentibly conducted alli
over the Pilture.
It will not be improper to treat alfo about Eafiness and Sedarenels:
in Polture, opposed to Stir and Bultle; and the contrary: Namely, that
the Picture of a Gentlewoman of Repute, who, in a grave and fedate
Manner turns towards that of her Husband hanging near it, gets a great
Decorum by soving and firring Hind-works, whether by means of
Waving Treesor croffing Archifecture of Stone, or Wood, or any thing
olfe that the Mafter thinks will belt controff, or oppose the sedate Po-
sure of his principal Figure: And becaute thefe are Things of Conte
quence, and may not be plainly apprehended by every one, 1 hall ex-
plain myfelf by Examples in Plare L. VIl, touching the Elegance and
Harmony of Back-grounds with the Figures.
in No. 1. 1 reprefent a beautiful Face againtt the Light of the
Ground; and the Drapery, which is Whice or of light Colouring, a.
gainl the Dark of it; thefe Oppofitions thus meetig produce a.
weet Nixture above, and below an agreeable Relief or Kilino of the
under Part of the Body; whereas, were it otherwife, the Face, as
but a fmall Part of the Body, would look too fharp and ditagrecable,
and the under Part of the Body would have no Force.
In No. 2. Being the Portrail of a Man of a more warm and Twaro

perr of the Figure; frewing the Oppofition of moveable Objects with

 in No. s. Appears the Reverfe; where the Folds hang freight and
mottly downwards, and the Off-works crots them.
No. 6. Gives us an Example of the opposing Action and Polture of
Bodies in two Fellow-portraits; for the Man, being on the Womans
right Side, turns his Face fidewars towards her; his Body is fronting,
receiving the Light from the right Side.
In No. 7. We iee the contrary in the Womans Pofture; her Face is
foreight, and her Body fways fideways towards the Man; the allo is
lighted from the right side.
The Figures numbered 8 and 9 reprefent alfo, yet in a different
Manner, the Contrall in the Motion; for the Woman, flanding on the
right side of the Man, has a fedace Motion; and fet and hanging
Shoulders: But the Man contrarily is in an active Motion. And
No. 12. Shews a proper Method to exhibit a great Extent, or seem
ingly fuch, in a snall Piece; for the Fioure ftands in a firong Light;
the By-ornaments, 272. Curtain, Vafe, Pillar and Walling are in Shade;
and the Oftskip or Hind work is light again, but fomewhat broke by
resion of its Diftance.
To conclude this Chapter I shall fay fomething of the placing of
Pertruits; and of their Point of Sight.
As to the former, its certain that when we fee any painted Figure,
of Object in a Place where the Life can be expected, as standing on the
Ground, leaning over a Balcony or Balluftrade, or out at Window,
C5r. it deceives the Eye, and, by being feen unawares, caules fometimes
a pleaing Miltake; as it frightens and furprizes others, when they
meet with it unexpectedly at fuch Places as aforefaid, and where there
is any Litelifood for it. if we are thus mifled by a Reprefentation of
Nature, how great mull the Mafter be who did ir! The Knowing
eteem him, Igaorants cry him up: If this be the Cafe, we ought to
endeavour to follow Narure and L:fclibood, and principally to oblere
the Rules of Perfpective; for who can doubt, that a standing, fitting
of moving Figure, artfully painted, and placed as aforefaid, wll ao

have the same Effect as the Life itfelf)

Fience it follows, that low Herisons, or Points of Sight, are the beft
and moft natural in a Portrait, and will moft deceive the Senfes, if the
Light and Diflance, with respect to the Place where the Pitture is to
be fet, be well obferved; otherwife the Effect will be contrary to what
we expected.
This Condult is chiefly necelfary in Portraits hanging high; for being
to much above the Eye, they muft needs have a low Horizon. Butas
Portraits are moveable, how natural and like foever they be, and well
handled, if they hang not in proper Places, they will not have a good
Effelt: Hence, the Mifchief attending them, is, that, by continually
changing their Places, they cannot always be painted to a certain
Height and Diftance, and confequently baffle our Rule: A Difficulty
which the greateff Mafters muft Hruggle with, and this Branch of the
Art is lable to.
Having now thewn that a low Horizon and Point of Sight are beft,
and moft natural, as fupplying, in fome meafure, this inconveniency
how much muft they miltake, who always chuse an high Herizen? They.
are on a Level with the Sitter, and yet place the Horizon many Feet
higher; nay, they think, thofe who do otherwife all againlt Nature
and Art: Some will have two Points of Sight in one Piece, one for
the Figure, another for the Ornaments; one level with the Eye, and
the other for the Offskip; one Hand higher or lower at pleature, or
about 3 or 4 Fingers Breadth above the Middle. Alcho’ thele are in=
excutable Errors, yet I think it vain to attempt their Redrels; but
hope the judicious Artill will weigh what I have faid, and endeavour
to avoid them.

that a Portrair in Little, as big as the Paim of an Hland, has as litle
Property in a Square againtt the Wall, espectally when it receives its
Light from witheut the Frome, and is bandled with as much Force as the
Life imjelf; which, with respelt to Force, I allow; nevertheless, a small
Portrait may, in order to make it look more nacural, be more eafily
helped, than fnall Flowers placed againft a Door, Window or other
Flat; which, in my Opinion, can in no wife be made good; but a
small Portrail may, as I. shall prove in what follows: In order to
which the Artiff mull previoutly contider,

Iy, how fsint it mutt be.
Secondly, that the Pitture cannot receive its Light from without the

2 Maidfervant was feen flanding at the Door, speaking to a Wo
man in the Street with a Child in her Arms: Some other Figures
appeared in the Front of the Picture, feen to the Shoulders
only, as if flanding in the Street. On the Sill of the Window
were lying a Bortom of blue Worfed ftuck with Needles, alle
2 Pair of Sciffors, a Piece of dark bine Cloth, and a Thimble,
all in full Proportion; to be thort, this Picture was by an Artifl,
with the Owner's Leave, fentenced to be dockt; in order to which, he
drew a Square Chalk-line round the Window, which contained the Doc-
cor, and cut away all the reft round about it, hitting here an Head,
there an Arm, without (paring any Body but the Doltor; who was in
Rantly put into a fimaller Frame: Thus the Piece was half cut away,
and for no other Reafon, as the Artift pretended, than that the Docior
alone was fufficient to fatisfy the Eye, the reft being fuperfinous. A
wretched Fate for to good a Picture! But fome Painters will keep the
old Read, becaute is difficult to cerrect a reoted Evil: They de asthe
old Womandid, who, being exhorted in her laft Sickness to embrace the
true Faith, antwered, She would follow the Steps of ber Fore-fathers,
were they all gone to the Devil.
So it is with a Portrait in Little, which has nothing of Nature, but
the Features, and looks like a Puppec; whereas there are well-known
Methodsto make it appear as big as the Life; nay, to move and fpeak, as
I may fay; but, being llighted, the Figure feems immoveable, dumb and
Little, and therefore unnatural.
On this Footing, I mean to thew, that all Things may be naturally
reprefented in Lttle, except a Moon light, which baffies all our
Skill
Now, if it be asked, Whether too nice an Exprestion of Parts in a
fmall Portrair, would not be fuperfiuous and unnatural, with respect to
Diltance, and whether lets fimthing would not be better? 1 fay, No;
provided it be not to flrong and warm as the Life; for the Figure not
being exhibited in open Freld, it cannot have to much Miflinets and
Vapour about it; and therefore the neat Fencilling cannor, be obftruc-
tive; elpecially if managed with Skill, as, the principal Parts well
touched, and the render and melcing Smallnefies in the broad Parts the
same, to that at the proper Diftance the one is feen more, and the o
thef less,

Thing appears to plain, elaborate and neat! But 1 antwer, that they
are not, nor can; becaute the Glats exhibits the Life without the Inter-
potition of Miftiness or Vapours, and with firong and warm Shades,
which overcome its Smallnels
I have often wondered at fuch fmall Paintings, becaute they feemed
as if I was looking in a Nuremberg Looking-glats, or thro' a Prospective;
fince they appeared not like the Life, but little moving Puppers.
Now, another Difficulty is, that, fince fuch Paintings cannot, ac-
cording our Policion, be made good, without the Addition of some
By-ornament, as lmagery in whole or half Figures, Vine-branches a
bout the Frame, or tomething lying on it, in order to sing them of, it
would be hard for thofe, who canonly paint a whole or halffength Fi-
gure, and ain at nothing elfe than to become Mafters therein; where
as, he who is better verted, may, by a due Obfervance of what has
been faid, eafily overcome the before mentioned Difficulties.
C H AP. VI. Of the Application of Requisites with respect to the
different Conditions of Persons.
T will not be foreign to our main Delign, to put the Artiff in mind
of the Application and right Ule of luch Materials as may enrich a
Portrait, and make it look the more noble: This is to great a
Point in Portraiture, that when well Known, we need never be at a
Standthro' the Mishape or Defects we often meet with in the Dispoliti-
on of a Portrait, and which fometimes mult not be hid; fince we have
always Mieans enough for obviating them with feeming Reafon, and
withour forcing Nature; as a long and narrow Face may be helped by an
Hood, or other Head-drets; a thick and too round a Pace, by the con
trary: A Figuretoo lonefome may be embellished with a Pillar, Pedettal,
Flower-por, Table and fuch Things as are proper to it; which ferre
not only for Ornament and Grandeur, but allo to express the Sitters
Luffre and Virrue: But Care mult be taken, that the Figure of the Sit
ter, as the principal Object of the Piece, fill up the major Part of it,
either by a preading Sway of the Polture, or by the Addition of some
proper By-work; by which Means it will have a good Effect.
Since 1us certain, that the Vices as well as Virrues have two power
ful Qualiries, and tho' contrary to each other, yer both tend to good
Purpole; nay, a wicked Perfon may, by a virtuous Example, be relcved
from

from Evil; and a virfuous Perfon, thro' had Example, led into Error
and Ruin; but Virtue being joined to Virtue, fearsno Evil; contrarily,
the Evil will make us avoid Evil. So Pictures should create an Ardor
for Virtue, and especially thofe of religious and good Perfons; fince
this, as we have faid in Chap. l. gave the firft Rife to their Reprefen-
lations, in order to perpecuate their Memories, as well as their Virtues
and glorious Actions.
To come then the better to this excellent Point, let us by noble By-
Works make Known their Virtues, Natures, Manners and particular In-
clinations, and exhibit them with their Perfons, in a conipicuous Man
ner. Wherefore I shall lay down some Examples, tho' drawn from
Heathen Story.

need not yield to Chrillianity itfelf; as Lucretis and Penelope in Chaffi-
ty; Catoin Steadinels and Courage; and many others whom we shall for
Brevity omit, to pals to the sketching some Reprefentations (or Materi-
als for luch) of the Circumftancesof a Court, Chamber, or other Apart-
ment; and an Example of achall Virgin shall be that of Lucretis. Iis
said to her Honour, that the was defcended of a noble Family, and fo
virtuoully educated, that the delighted only in that ; now, whether we
reprefent her living or dead in that Character, we may adorn ber part-
ment with fine Tapefiries, Statues and Pictures; in the Pitures, the
Hiflory of Penclope at work; the Fable of Coronis and Neptane fome
modeft Emblems of Gods, Coc. all relating to Chaflity and Honour.
If Statues, or Houhold gods, be neceflary, let them be Paltos,
Diana, Hymen, and especially Pery: Her Bed may be ornamented
with Challity and Stedfarinets; and on ber Couch may be feen some
Cupids lighting each other's Torches, or playing with Palm-branches
and Olive-leaves: The spartment may be here and there furnithed with
Gold and Silver Vafes, Cups and other Houle-plate, wrought with virty
ous Significations; but herein, Care muft be taken not to introduce
any Thing foreiga to the Matter, or againtt Hiflory; which ought to
be confulted.

itself, which alters four Times a Vear, with respect to Colour, would
not be allowed every body to wear; as in Spring; Green; in Sum-
mer, Vellow; in Aummn, Red; and in Winter, Fillemot. Vellow
or fallow-faced Perfons durft not wear Red; or red-faced ones,

Reong, but White and all light Colours. The Blacks love White a-
bove any Colonr, and think no Dress better becomes them than a light
coloured one; and not without Reafon; for would not a black Man
with black or dark Cloaths be frightful to look ar? And how ridicu
lous is it for a pale Virgin, to dress in all Sorts of light and pale
Colours, in order to look lets pale; and that one who is red, wear
nothing but Red for the fame Reafon: Hereby, inflead of hiding 1
small rault, the Mafter would commit a greater; and yet this is the
common Notion: But if I may give my Opinion, a red and fiery-faced
Perfon, dred in Red, feems to me like a red painted Statue; and a
pale-looking Perfon in a light or yellow Dress, as fick or dead. Where
fore, if we would be artful, we muft manage otherwife; to wit, that
thofe, whom we would reprefent bealthy or fickly, ought to appear
such by contrary Colours; as lively Colours for a fick or unhealthy Perfon;
and weak and faint ones for healthy Perlons: Vet ler me not be here
mifunderitood; I fay not this as a politive Law, without Exception,
but as an Hint to Tyros. The more experienced Know, what the
Art teaches; for the is not deficient: But as the Drapery sometimes
over-rules, so we can manage the Naked accordingly; for inflance, red
Drapery requires a middling Carnation, between pale and red; fo al-
to it ought to be with a pale Colour. When I fay that Decorum confifts
in an Oppesstion, it mult be underftood, that Oppesstion has its Degrees,
which we ought to know and ufe according to the different Occations,
and the Grounds againtt which they happen to come: But in general
Terms, the Naked mult always feem to be of a diftinel Nature from
the Draperies.

ticular tolerably fuccetsful; tho' they know not, how they got the
Knowledge, it happening moftly by Chance: They are charmed
with some fine and taking Colours in this or that great Mafter; thefe
they ule at random in their own Productions, either forwards or in the
Depth, Middle or Sides; and if they happen to be placed againtt a
proper Ground, or are fer off by any aiding By-colour, the Work his
right, in farisfying both the Eye, and Rules of Art; but if thefe
fine Colours happen not to fuit the Grounds, then all is wrong, and
the Arriff at a fland.
To explain this Point, we shall be more particular, and clear it by
Examples; tho' I think I have already in this Book fpoken largely
enough of it, in treating of Back-grounds and the Harmony of Co-
lours in a Portrait. A certain Arcift having feen a very beautiful
whice and green Lace on a young Lady's Gown, painted by a great
Mafter, he mull by all means imitate it; butbeing asked, Whether
he had taken due Notice of the Groundcolour of the Gown! he
antwered, — No. — How then can this fine and becoming Lace
have a good Effect in his Works, unless by chance? The Reafon of
which is, I think, that either through Shame or Pride, or both, the
Arciff takes fomething from a great Mafter; for Inftance, what he
uted in the Lointain, the other, that it may not be Known, brings
forward; and what he has reprefented in the open Air, the other

by a right Application the Thefe would be lawful! But tis fuch Mens
Misfortune, to be, in this Particular, moft out of the way, when they
think they do beft: For, wanting the great Malters Wit, Judgment
and Apprehention, they have no true Notion of his Conduct, and
therefore are eafily mifted, and, like KJop’s Raven, expoted to Cen
fure.
Since Tis an undoubted Truch, that we can perform nothing but
what paffes through Thought, and of which, either by feeing of
hearing, we get an Idea; therefore muft the Paintings, Drawings and
fine Prints of old Mafters give an Handle to Thoughts and Praltice;
for he who never faw a Lion can never paint him well, unless by
the Help of a Draught, or Model: As was the Cafe of a certain Weft
pbaliss, who reprefenting Duniel in the Lion's Den, and having never
leen a Lion, he painted Hogs inflead of Lions, and wrote underneath,

Models of them, we shall never exhibit them naturally ; fince Memo-
ry is but the Repofitory of Knowledge and Thoughts, from which
they draw the Things which Judgment effeems ufeful and service-
able.
Iam of Opinion, that two great Advantages arife from copying
great Malters Works: The one is, that therein we fee many Defelts
of fimple Nature corrected by their Skill and judgment; and the other,
that by this means we accuftom ourfelves to rectify thofe Defells.
when we have Nature before us: Truly two Points of great im-
Portance.
But alasl is an Artiff, confidered in his natural inclination, other
wife than a Child, which, advancing in Age, follows its impulfe? If
he perform one praife-worthy Act, how many Errors will he contrari-
ly commit? But when this Bent is condulted by Reafon and Art, the
Perceptions of the Mind will then, as thro' a clear Channel, flow
pure and undefiled: Which leads me in some meafure to confels, that
Art and Praltice have great Advantages, and are more to be fer by
than all we receive from Narure, which is often defective in defired
Perfection, in a fingle Object: But the is perfect in her Performances
and Objects in general; and, in that Senfe, Art is obliged to follow
her; wherefore, with the Philolopher, I mult fay of Arcifts

And settlel Prattice makes a Pifture move.
Heace we may eafily perceive what we should do to cure this great
Defelt of the Mifule of other Mien's Works; but, that I may be the
better underffood, I shall infiff on further Means for doing it: If then
it happen, that the Arriff meet with any thing which is very taking,
and he be defirous to make it his own, whether fine Colours, Drapery,
Stone, Coc. Let him take Notes, in his Pocket book, of the Ground, By-

and Sbades, and which I repeat here, becaute I think Face-painters
frequently aft contrarily, in feeing a faint yet fine Drapery reprefent-
ed witkin-deors, which, with the fame Tint, they exhibit in an open
Air.
The like heedles Miftake we fee in the Copies of many Dilciples
and young Matters after old or modern Paintings; for, not obferving
whether in lettening their Copies (which they generally do) they
should not aHfo abare in Strength of Colour and Tints, their Colouring,
as well in Light as Shade is as flrong as the Original. The same Er-
for they commit in painting a great Copy after a fmall Original. But
this ill Conduct is owing chiefir to Mafters when they fet their Pupils
to copy in a different Size, in not admonithing them of it; but rather
defiring that ther shall imtate every thing as exactly as poffible tho'
in falt it be againtt the Rules of Arc. Tis therefore certain, that a
Picture with Figures, or a Landskin, fuppole it as big as the Life, to
be copied a third fots in Size, the Tints in the Copy mult needs be a
third jainter than the Original; and the more it lesfens in Size, the
finter the Tints, or elfe it cannor be good. If this Conduct be of fuch
Moment in copying Pictures, of how much greater Confequence mult
It be, when a Portrait-painter diminithes the Life, or paints a Portrait
in full Proportion from a small one, with respect to the weakening or
Hrengthening of Colours.

ther have done is enough for our Practice; but this is Weakness;
fince Are and Nature have fuch a Fund of Objects, and our Time for
hearning and living is long enough, and by confulting within ourfelves
we may (pir our Genins.
Others commit the fame Fault by a contrary Impulfe; for to vio-
lent is their inclination to some particular great Mafter in his Objects,
Colouring, Cor. that they think in loff Time to employ their Thoughts
on the Works of any other good rriff; and being thus wedded to
him, they with, drudge and plod to be like him as well in Errors as
Perfections: By this means, and by a puntual Imitation of Blunders
and Miftakes, it fometimes happens, that the Copy and the Original
are not to be diffinguithed, both being to wonderfully like each other;

which he ought to be Mafter of, before he takes to Painting, and to
underfland this well before he proceeds to make Ordonnances; and
then, if he have a thorough Knowledge of the latter, he will paint
a good Picture. Vet Tis often feen, that his Work is but taken
for that of a Pupil, nay, worle than a Copy; and what, is fill lets,
its not like his own Manner or Handling, — And why?
Such Artifts, being advanced thus far, endeavouring to produce their
own inventions, no longer minding Grounds and Rules, but Rriving
only at Novelties, care little for painting or deligning well; whence
their Works are oftentimes indifferencly defigned, poorly handled
and coloured, but well ordered; arifing only from a Neglect of
their Mafters Infiractions, and what they Know, and an tich for
what they fill want to know; whereby they are often shipwrecked be-
tween both: Pernicious Effect of the Bent of our Vouth! which can-
not be remedied otherwife than by returning to original Principles and
their putting in Ufe: Forasbyan Excels in loading Weight upon Weight

C H AP. I. Of Architefture in general.
FT ER having handled to many different Parts of the
8
Art, we meet allo with Archifecture; an rt full of
25
noble Performances and fine Ufes. But our Purpofe is
A
not to infiff on all its Advantages, or to give a Syfiem
of it; fince fuch a Work would be too tedious, and
T
calls for Homer or Virgils Eloquence; and having been
copioutly handled by feveral learned Pens, we shall treat no further
of it than what concerns a Painter, leaving the reft to Architects.
An ingenious Hiffory-painter, if he would be univerfal, muft needs
underfland Archicecture and Statuary; becaufe he will otherwife be at
2 Nonplus in fome Things; he ought even to be as knowing as an
Archirect, and how to order a good Building, tho' is an Archifects
daily Practice, and but a Part of the Painter's.

Writers fay, that the Babylonians were the firft, and after them the
Egpptians, Greeks and Romans, who brought it to Perfection; Kill in
the Emperor Auguffars Time, it arrived at its highelt Pirch: But funk
afterwards by the irruption and Barbarity of the Cotbs, Vandals, Hunks
and Lengebards, who burned and deftroyed all before them. A true
Proof that nothing in the World is permanent and ftablel
But to come to our Purpofe, we mult premife that the Word (Arobi.
telture) timply figaities Draughts or Designs, after which, a Building is
carried up and conttructed; and comprehends the five following Orders,
namely, The Tufcan, Deric, lonic, Roman and Corinthian; according
to which, all Buildings are regulared, whether Pulaces, Temples, Town-
houses, Triumphatarches, Bagnios, Theatres, Toungates, Galleries,
Tombs, and other magnificent Buldings, round or (quare, or both;
peak of their ourward Contiruction. The Word Order is of large Ex-
rent; but in Architelture is, as Vitravius defines it, a joining of different,
proportionate and fimmetric Parts, as Pedeftals, Columns and their Or-
naments, in fuch Manner as to compofe a perfelt Order and Body.
As for the Entablatures over Columns, to wit, Architraves, Frises
and Cornices (which for their Richnels have got the Name of Orna-
ments) they may, as little as the Orders themfelves, be either mixed a
mong one other, or changed from one Order to another. A careful Paint
or will not only diltinguith one fort from another, from Cornice to Bafe;
but will alfo take Care not to put an Lonic Moulding on a Deric Pede-
Ral; a Corinthian on a Tuscan; a Roman Cornice on an Lonick Frize,
36.
Further, its certain that the Orders do not promifcuoutly fuit all
Sorts of Buildings, but ought to to be applied (relpecting their Parts and
Ornaments, which alfo difter in general from each other) as to have an
Harmony and Agreement with the whole Buildings, with respect to
their Situation and Quality.
Thele Orders mult be eariched in their feveral Kinds, to thew a fuit=
able Decorum, especially the Capitals, except the Tuscan, which is
throughout plain and fimple: The Doric Order excels in its Irighphs
and Metopes : The lonic in its Volates, Modillions, &cc. The Roman
in the Elegance of Cornices, and Beauty of Capitals with their Vo-
lutes, and Oak-leaves. And the Gerinthian by its Mouldings of victo
fious Olive-leaves, and its excellent and agreeable Capitals.

Dithes, Hammers, Axes, Knives, Coc.
Among the Works of the Ancients we fee in the Frizes of the Lonie,
Remus and Corinthian Orders (efpecially in the two laft) some Foliage
of Oak-leares; which has a fine Elfect, when rwined with Shrubs and
Vine-branches, interfperted with Rofes and other Flowers. Sometimes
are incroduced Vizards, with playing Children and running Ani
mals: Allo Feffoons of Fruir, Leaves, and various Kinds of the moft
beautiful and agreeable Flowers; thele tied together look nobly, elpe
cially when judicioutly placed: But enough of this: He who would
Know more sorts of frizal Ornaments, mull confult the Works t of the
Ancients, in which he will find them, tho' the before mentioned are
the Principal, and most in Ule.
Altho’' the Ancients reach, chatthe Frents of Buildings (which are
the Parts moll in View) ought to be more adorned than the Flinks and
Rears, ver fome modern Mafters have mifunderffood this, and appie
hended, as if in thofe Parts the Ornaments could not be too many; nat,
they have crowded the Mouldings of the Architrave, Frize and Cor
nice, and of the Pedeftals under Columns, with small Carving, in fuch
a Manner, that it rathercaufes Confution than Ornament, as appearsby
their lYorks; but when ufed in Moderation, and, between the principal

CHAP. II. Of the Rifes of the Ornaments, Columns and their
Pedeftals.
A VIN G fpoken in the former Chapter, of the Decoration of
I the Orders, we shall now, in a brief Manner, treat of the Rifes
and Divitions of the Columns, with their Ornaments and Pedeftals:
The Ornament (or Entablature) of the Tuscan Column rifes 1 Module
Parts of a Module (by Modale is meant, throughout the Orders, the
Pillars Distmecer next above the Bafe.) The Column, with its Bafe and
Capital rifes 7 Modules½, and the Pedeftal 1 Module?: This being
agreed, the Entablature and Pedeftal are each? of the Columns Rife;
the Bafe under the Column, and Capital over it, are each in Rife; a
Module; the leffening (or Diminution) of the Shaft of the Column as
the Neck under the Capital is f of a Module, and it begins below at ½
of the Column's Rife.
The Entablature of the Deric Column rifes 2 Modules ; the Co-
luma, with its Bafe and Capital, is 8 Modalesj; and the Pedeftal 2
Modules,;:. This being fixed, the Entablature is j and the Pedeftal 9
and Lofithe Cohnrs Rife. The Bafe and Capital are each, as in the
Tusros, i a Module. The Diminution at the Neck of the Shafr, is:. of

2 Modale, and begins below at 2 Parts 1 of the Column's Rile,: divid
ed into 12 Parts
The Entablature of the Lonit Colums rifes 1 Module ½; the Co.
lumn, with its Bafe and Capital, is 8 Modules;, and the Pedefal
2 Modules j: This ferrled, the Entablature is; and the Pedeftalz
Parts; of the Column’s Rife. (But if the Frize, be caryed, the Entabla-
ture is 4 Parts f of the Column's Rife, and in the following Orders the
fame.) The Capital with its Volures, is little more thani a Module,
and the Bale is juft half a Module (and in the following Orders the
Lame.) The Diminurion ar Neck is f of a Module, and begins below at
3 Partsf of the Column’s Rife divided into 12 Parts, as aforefaid.
The Entablacure of the Romon Colams, riles 1 Module 2½ Parts of
a Module; the Column, with iis Bafe and Capital, is9 Modules;;
the Pedefial rifes z Modules: Which laid down, the Entablature is:,
and the Pedeftal z Parts; of the Column’s Rife; the Capital rifes 1
Module f; the Bale as before; the Diminution at Neck is : of a Mo.
dule, and begins below at the Rife of 3 Partsy of the Column, di-
rided as aforefaid
The Entablature of the Corintbian Colasm rifes 2 Modules; the Co
lumn, with its Bafe and Capital, is ro Modules in Rife; the Pedeltal;
Modules, : After which, the Ecablacure is ; and the Pedeftal; of
the Column's Rile; the Capital rites 1 Module-; the Bale as before;
the Diminution at Neck isf of a Module, and begins below at: of
the Column’s Rifs.
The Breadch of the Talcas and Doric Pedeffals ought always to be
equal with the Plinths or Bates of their Columns; and tho' the Plinths
in the three other Orders project more at their Bortoms, by Reafon of
their Sweeps, their Pedettals muft nevertheless be alike perpendicular
with the upper Points of their Plinths.
Let me here ix the Height of a Statue on a Pedeial placed next 2
Column; fince many mistake in it. In right Proportion it ought not to
rife higher thant of the Column; but then the Column should not be
too high, or too low, but flandon a Bafe only, which is frequencly con
finned thro' the Building. As for Pedeftals, they ferve only to raife a
Column, and angment its Ornament. Weought allo; for Elegance, to
take care, that the Figure and its Pedeftal be proportionate to each
other; becaute, if the latter be too great or too small, the Figure would
become too small, or monfirous

C H A P. III. Of the Property of a Building, and Observations
thereon.
MU ST believe, according to the Evidence of Writers, and the
Tradition of Travellers, that the Iralians have the beft Talte, as
well for Archicecture as Painting; and tho' its certain, that Ger-
many, France, England, Holland, and other Countries have produced
fine Archicelts, yet at this Time they are not comparable to the Irati-
ans, whofe Manner, which is the Antique, is now followed by the
moll polite Nations. The old Tare was known by the Name of the
Gothir, as a certain Writer affirms, faying; That the Gothic Manner
of Building of the ancient Germons (which at that Time gave Law
 to all other Nations) is quite abolithed by the Ialians Nay, he cries
out, What magnificent and choice Wonders do we not fee
in proud Ialy, lofty Rome especially, where it feems as if Nature
and Art have mutually agreed to eftablith their Thrones, and exert
 their Powers, in order to make this famous City the Miflress of the
World, and the Beauty of the Univerle! St. Peter's Church, the
Vatican, the Retanda, and many other Structures (ferving the whole
World for Examples, and without which, Archicecture is but a con-
fuled Mass) draw yearly thoulands of People and young Artifls thi
:ther to improve themielves by them, for the Service of their own
Countries; to that the finell and newelf Things which we fee in thofe
Countries, lately builc, and still going forward, are deligned in the
Nalian Gulfo. Wherefore it is to them that thofe fine Piles, the
Stadthoule at Amferdam, the new Lutheran Church, and divers other
Structures, as well without as within the Town, do owe their Origin
and Beauty.
We are then much indebted to thofe great Artifts, Fitrurins, Sertio,
Philibert de POrme, Pulladie, Cataneo, Lee Baptifa Santeririe, Vigno-
1n, Scamezsi, and many others, who have enlightened the World
with their Works and Wricings. And I think, that no one can be a
good Architect who has not fiudied thofe Authors. The Freach ac-
knowledge, that their great Improvements in this Art areowing to the


Works and Precepts of thofe excellent Mafters.

We shall now freak of intire Buildings to far as they ferve for Or-
nament in Painting. The Goodness of 2 Building fprings not meerly
from the aforefaid Rifes, Breadths or Depths of the Orders, but from
an appofite Conjunction (or bringing together) of different proportionace
Parts into an exquifite Body, which, by reafon of its excellent Form,
whether in Height or Breadch, appears to the Judgment of the Know.
ing, both admirable and beautiful; especially, when firly adapted to
the Quality of the Owner, and has general Conveniency with respect
to Culom
In its particular Parts a Building requires, 1. A firm Foundation.
2. A large and convenient Stair cafc. 3. A pacious Entrance. 4. An
elegant Divition of Doors, Windows and other Openings. .5. An
handlome Fronciffiece, csc. Thefe skilfully work’d, and judicioutly
dilpofed muft needs produce a fine Effect.
Thus much for the outward Face of a Building.
If ant object, that Decorum confifts more in inward Contrivance;
let me luppoie a Stranger to come into a Town, and, paffing thro' the
Streets, he were asked, what he thought of the Buildings? What
Anfwer would he make? Would he not fay they were either fine or
mean? Or would he tay, — I muft firft fee the infides, and whether
the Foundations be firm, the Apartments well-dispoted and well-light
ed, and whether the Underground offices be good? - This would
be ridiculous: Tis true, an Houfe mull have thefe Properties; but tis
idle to think, that therefore we cannot judge of the Building by the
Ourfide only; as if the Perfon, who is able to give a Delign for a
Fabrick, cannot allo compart its intide. Let it be asked then, Where
in confifts a good Divition within? Whether tis a Scrence which Paint

Apartments of a determinate Form, Length, Rife, and Breadth, and
what thote muff be? Whether there muft be one, two, or more Stacks
of Stairs? Whether each Room muft have one Chimney or two:
And whether the Floors muft be Wooden or Stone ? Or whether a Pa-
lace is, for its Largenets, more beautiful than a common of Citizens
Houle?
But, waving other Mea's Opinions, we shall proceed in our Purpole,
to far as concerns a Painter in thefe Countries, and no further: Our
Judgment is, that the bed Proportion in a Building is one chird higher
in Rife than Breadth, especially if it be covered in with a Compats
roof and its Appurtenances; but if flat-roofed, a third wider than high,
and to be commanded by a fingle Order riting from Bottoon to Top:

in painting a good Building there mult appear, befides the Archi-
telture, Perlpetuve and Colouring, an orderly Disposition producing
Elegance, otherwife ris of no Worth. Orderly Difpofition confifts in
to joining the Parts, that they mutually fer off each other in a pleasing
Variety, and thereby exhibic a fine Piece of Work, and an agreeable
Figure: This Variety fprings from the Incqualiry of Openings, or
Windows, whether Oblongs, Squares, Circles or Ovals; the Dispolici-
ons of thefe Ovenings, near and over each other, are founded on Reafon,
as shall be explained by an Example.
We exhibr in Plate LIX. a Temple topp’d with a Cupols, or ras
ther an Houfe round -roofed. On each side of the Door a Flight of
Steps defcend balluftraded; underneath which, is a Vault; and over
the Entrance, a Balcony: Now, beginning from below, we shall thew,
what Figure each Opening ought to have in an orderly Difposicion.
The Door under the Steps is (quare, rifing fomewhat more than ins
Diameter: That of the Entrance is circular on Top, and riles; more
than its Dismeter: That of the Balcony allo riles i more than its
Breadsh, but is (quare or flat on Top; and then we meet the Roof
rounding again. Now let us difpofe it otherwife, and make the Door
below circular, the next square, the next round; and no Roof appearing.
+
Thus much for Doors; for we find no other than round and iquare ones.
The fame Method may be taken with Windows. When there ase two.
Ranges one above the other, the undermoll may be oblong and the up
permoff compass, but lower; if there be another Range of Windowsa.
bove thefe, next the Roof, they ought to be perfect Squares. This
Rule we have taken from the Works of the Ancients, who always
gave their Openings or Windows more Rife in the firft Story than the
second, sill leffening in the third, yer all alike in Diameter. Win.
dows should never be lower than about 2 Feet from the Floor within.
If there be Windows in the Bafement-ffory, (where the Walling is
thickeff, and is ufually finished with a Rafic Order) they mull be
Square, and above either Scheme (little rounding) or flat; and thus

the one thews the other, with respect to Roundacts and Squarencts. If
now there were Compass-windows in the Bafement and upper Stories,
the uppermoff should be circular, and the undermoff oval, with their
longeft Diameter parallel with the Level of the Building, becaule, be-
ing proffed by Weight, their Arch is dilared; when contrarily the
athers do not bear any Weight But circular Windows are grown
out of Ufe, as not admitting Light to well as the (quare ones.
If in the Piers berween iI indows there were Niches and Figures in
them, and over head, room for a Baisrelief, then the Table for it
muft be (quarg; but circular, where tis over a Square Window.
As for Doors over each other, I fay; that if there were over
the Cornice a Compats-pediment, and on both Sides a Bullultrade
with Figures; then the Balcony-door ought not to be circular, but
Square, and ornamented with Pilaffers: Ver the Door of the En
france may be circular. We ought even not to fer on the Balcony 2
Ballultrade with Figures, but ornament it with Balls or other low
Things. The one of other Balluttrade mult be allo diverfified; for
two Parts alike, in two fuch emment Places, have an ill Effect;
wherefore one of them should be clofe walled (Parapet-wife) and
the Face of it may then be enriched with Bals-reliefs of Figures, Fef

There is Hill fomewhar behind, which, tho' contrary to the Dispo-
firion aforelaid, muit be animadverted; tis touching a Flower -garden,
which, if fine, mull needs be regular, as well with respect to its gene-
fal Form, as its particular Divition, at leaft the two Sides ought to be
alike, whether fer off with Pots, Vafes, Starues or other Ornaments.
We are taught indeed, that Uniformity is fliff, and not Painterlike;
wherefore we should avoid it as much as poffible: But, weighing the Pre-
cept maturely, we shall find the Fault to lie in our Milapprehention of it:
Onellionlets Things proceeding from Rule and Order muft be regular,
but that Regulariry may nevertheless be fomewhar hidden on occafion:
Wherefore, tho' a Garden be uniform on both Sides, we are under no
Necefficy of shewing all that Uniformity; one Side is fufficient; the
reft may be handfomely hid, or broke with a Tree, Piece of Stone
work, Column, or a Corner of the Houfe But let us not from hence

we fee but a Part of them, we may conceive the Refidue.
More Examples of breaking Uniformity may be thefe: When a
Figure flands on each Side of a Gate or Alcove, a Man may be pix
ced or fit down before one of them, in order to create Inequality; to
alfo if by means of a Curtain, one of thefe Figures be shaded. If a
Balsrelief be fet on each side of the Gate, of Alcove, one of them
may partly be covered by the Perfonages, to anfwer our Purpofe. If
without doors on both sides of an Entrance, there be a carved Lion
or Sphinx, we may break off one of their Heads. Solomon's Throne
was adorned with 12 golden Lions; we need not fee them all; the fix
on one Side thew-fufficiently, that there muff be as many on the other:
two of three, entire are enough, of the reft we may fee only a Part;
here and there. Thus we mull always manage in like Cafes.

BJ E C T S have a fine Effeet, when Nature and Art are jeised
 together by a skilful Hand; and tho' all Kyes are not alike qua-
lifed to apprehend the Reafons of it, yet they are, by 2. wont
derful Sagacity, lentible of it; confelting, that it is beautiful, and fo
ought to be, tho' the one Perfon, as I fay, underfland it, and the other
de not: And for this Reafon; Art has luch a Power, that tho' Narure
be beautiful in her Productions, yet they would not perfectly pleafe pun
Eyes, without the Help of Art..
Nature produces an intinity of fine Stones of various Colours and
Qualities; but Art alone judges of their Firness and orderly Location,
as to Rank and Dignity; infomuch that, tho' igaorant in Art,. we. can
clearly apprehend, that it qught so be fo, and no otherwife..
We know, that the Whirars foff and tender, and lovely to the Eye;
the Black contranly. is melanchaly and difagreeable.

tures and Qualities, without forcing Nature, and running counter. to
Art.

If any ask, why the Red is not fet before the Fellow, fince the Red

Red and Green are Oppofers in Strength; contrarily, Vellow is proper
to Green, fince Vellow and Blse produce Green.
If arany Time we are obliged to place, besween two Stones of ore

wic.
Between two black Marbles fuit beft Jafper, Copper of Brats.
Between two Serpentine, or green marble Stones, the same.
Between two red Stones, Whire.
Between red, black or ferpentine Scone, Pifan whice exed Marble.
Between two grey Stones, Free-fone or yellowiff-white Marble.
Between two docted long veiny Stone, one that is speckled; and
the contrary.
Bcweentwo Jafpers, yellow, or ffethy whice Marble.
A Marble painter muft oblerve the Conveniency and Place for marbling:
If the Place be large, or an Hall, then he may do it with Force;
but in a fmaller Compass, he ought to moderate it, and keep it faint,
that the Place may not feem thereby leffened, or the Eye offended If
the Room be hiing with Piltures, he should confult Men of Experience,
especially the Matter who painted them, what Colouring will fir bet.
About light Pictures, dark Marble is beft, and about dark Pictures,
Light Marble, as Pifun, Jafperor any tending to a light Vellow. But if
it be a fingle Colour, fuch as Bafsreliefs, then Free ffone fuits beft.
In bringing many Sorts of coloured Marbles together, we may, for
Inftance, in a Froarispiere either fingle or double colonaded and pedeltal-
ed, very agreeably dispote them thus: Vide Phire LX.. The Bale
and Pedeftal mouldings may be Black, liticcyed; the Block, or Square

the Pedeftals; the Frize may be dark Red, like the Blocks or Squares
of the Pedettals; and the Cornice, Black again, like the Architrave;
if the Frize have raited Ornaments of Foliage, Children, Triglyphs,
Ox-fculls, Coc. they ought to be White; if over the Cornice be a Pa-
rapet, it may be intirely of another Colour, and the Pedeltals and
their Members of Pisan or other cross-veined Marble, and the Pannels
or Faces of grey Marble, or White, if adorned with Bats relicts; the
Figures, or Vales on top allo Whice.
This Diftribution may be doubled, and varied on Occafion: The
Frizes and Columns may be White; the Bafes and Capitals, Gold;
and to may alfo the Ornaments be, to wit, Triglyphs, little Blocks
and Foliage; the reft may remain as before.
In an Hall of red or other Marble (where the Mouldings of the
Ornaments are different, larger or finaller) we may make a Door-fron-
tispiece, or Alcove, of white or other Marble; but if the Members
continue along the Hall, the Froncilpiece or Alcove ought to be of
the same Colour with the Room: The Room may be of one Order.
and the Frontifpiece, Alcove and Chimney of another: Thus the
Corinthian or Roman. The Pave-
Room may be fonic, and the reft,
ment of the Floor mult correspond
with the Building; I mean, if the
Room have Pilafters, the Bands (or bordering Marbles tying the
Pavement) muff run up to them, whether the Pilaffers sland wide or
clofe; for they ought to be to laid, as to thew every where a Regula-
rity, wharever Jets or Breaks the Door, Frontifpiece, Alcove, Coc.

ced such Figures or Compartments, as beil anfwer the general Purpofe,
and they may be of what Colour you pleafe.

ed to part them by fome Figure coming between; and yer the Bands,
which bind the sides, mult come every where alike. If there he Co-
lumns on both Sides of the Gallery, the Bands muft run, crofting it,
from one to the other.
Proceed we now to party-coloured Tombs, and other Stones. On
white Sphinxes, Lionelles, Coc. fuits well a Tomb of Serpentine or
Porphyry; and on a black Plinth, if no Figures or other Ornaments

H E Beautr in painting Buildings confifts in an elegant Expret
fion of the Difference of Stones which compofe them; and ths
may be effeted not only by their Divition, but allo by their
Colours, especially in Outffe-xert, which is not to much heeded as
the Ixeard, and is subject to more inconveniencies of Ran, Hail and
If ind; and if tlanding in damp Places, their Ettect in a few Vears i:

Fountains must be suppoled to tuffer much, and become very moff

cipally Pyramds, which are not fer up to much for the take of

is no great Matter, whether the Stones of thefe be of one for

getloofe, and muft needs drop. Again, some Stones, being more weak
and brittle than others, and corroded by the Air, Dampnels and
Drought, are broke in Picces by the Preffure of thofe over them,
and thus leave Gaps and Breaks, wherein the Rain gatker:, out
of which grow Weeds, Mots and other Greens, fomctimes whole
Branches; all which, at the Vear's End, decay, and become green
Sap, trickling thence down the Stones.
We shall here flop a little to lay tomething touching 46.yes: I know
not how some can to far relif Slovenlinets, as to (poil not only Stalues
and fine Firares, but allo intire Buildings; if they were broken or
mouldered Pieces, Ruins and other decayed Stones, it would be nn Da-
mage if ever to much muddled and bedropped; but tis very impro-
per to ferve intire and fine Figures thus, and in Places too where are
neither Trees, or any thing elfe to occafion it: The fame they do in
Buildings looking as freth as at tirll; were the Spots, feen on them, na-
cural to the Stones, it would be more proper than all the Gutters
nfually reprefented to trickle down them: Wherefore Care mull be
taken, before we begin to paint Tkings supposed to be dropped on, that
2 Difference may appear between Nearnels and Diltance; for as Spots
in Cloaths are more vifible near than afar off, to the Faintness of re-
mote Objects mult be obferved. But let me ask, what Foulness of
Wet and Dult can flick to fmooth Bodies, which Rain, Hail, of
Snow do not wath off? But they may decay and be confumed by Time;
especially thole facing the North, which futter all Extremities. We
fee many Inftances of Decay in ancient Buildings, where are Figures fo
eaten up by Time, that tis hardly difcernable, whether they repre
fented Men or Women; like Figures of Snow partly diffolved by the
Sun-beains.
I peak not here to much againt the dropping upon and muddling
such Objects, as of the Abuie when the Caufe of luch an Effect does
not appear; for without a probable Reafon why a Thing should be
thus, or thus, Art becomes Obllinacy. But to recurn to our subject.
It is certainly Praife-worthy to take fome Pains in thewing the

we muft aroid the Mistakes of some Painters, who vein and eye their
Work, and afterwards divide it into Stones, whereby one Vein or Eye
happens offentimes to run through two or three Stones at once; whence
we muft conclude it to be what it is, meer Painting and not the Life:
Whereas, I think it the moll certain Way, firft to divide the Work
into Stones, and then to marble and eye them; obferving that each
Stone have a particular Eye, to thew the Difference between the casusl
Drepfing and the Maibling.
Marble Buillings have a beautiful Effect when the Architecture is
fine and well ornamented; and this as well in Painting as the Life:
Orderly Dispofition is one of the belt Reafons thereof, without which
it cannot have that vall Agreeablencts.
A knowing Archrell takes especial Care of the fetting the Stones
of his Building in fuch Manner as to blazon its Beauty, and improve
it, and thereby creare Harmony; wherefore he dispofes the Eyeveny
Stones in the properel Manner; jfor Inftance, in a fingle-colonaded Pory.
co, the reing Ezes mu? oppose euch other, floping from out to in; or
contrary: The same Method muft be obferved in the Pitaffers, and all
Parts that are paired; to that the Work may appear regular at a Di.
ftance, taking especial Care that they be eyed ante, to keep the Eye
always in a Ballance between them. The Stones for the Architran,
Frize and Cornice should be to cholen, that the Veining fall pe:pendi-
cular, in order to keep the Members diffinct; which they would not
be, were the tems to fall in with the Mouldings.
II remains to be obferved in marbling Columns, that the Eye-veins
ought to receive the ftrongelt Light on the reliered and swelling Purts,
in order to aid the Flar of the Picture by Art; which Nature wants
not, as being round of herfelf: Wherefore it would look ill, that the
moft dark of the Eye-veins come on the weaker Parts, becaute it
would render the Effect you propoted, abortive.
Imagine a Piece of Walling divided into three Pannels, on each
Side of which fland two Columns; the two firtt ought to oppofe each
other; their Veining muft either be level, or run diagonally againt
each other, ourwardly or inwardly: The two others mull do the fame

C H AP. Vi. Of Ruins.
ITHER TO we have spoken of the Beauty and Regularity
a A of intire Buildings; wherefore tis proper next to treat of Frag-
ments and Ruins, equally necelfary with the former.
Te fometimes wonder’d how it happens, that among the Painters
of Figures and Landskip, who make ufe of Buildings and other Brick-
work, to few exhibit whole and highly-finished ones; all they thew is,
Ruins, broken Walls and decayed Stones, but feldom intire and per-
feet Structures, becaute, as I take it, theyll be at no Trouble to fearch
Antiquiry for the Forms and molt beautiful Parts of Archirelture,
whereby they might learn to produce fomething curious: A Supinity
proceeding from their want of Knowledge, and Ambition to obtain
II.
Altho' many think, that a Piece of Ruins does not require to great
a Regard as an intire Building, they are much miftaken; for the one
as well as the other depends on Meafure and Proportion: Ver some
will go and throw down a Part of a Building, and intermix with it
some Fragments of Capitals, Pieces of Frizes, Corices and the like,
of an Order foreign to the Building; which, tho' very wrong, they
salve by fuppoling, that when a Building is in Ruine, no one will have
the Curiofity to examine the Rubbith to fee, whether there be a wrong
Capital, Frize or Cornice; and granting, fuch were to be found, the
Fault would be none, fince thofe broken Parts might be brought thi
ther cafually : But this is a lame Excule; to fpeak the Truth, Ican
not apprehend how any one can be to wilfull, fince no more Know-
ledge and Trouble are neceffary to the beft than the work Things, to
the whole than to the half; in the one, we mult ule the Footrule
and Compaffes as well as in the other. If a beautiful Remain of a
great Building adorn a fine Landskip, and look grand, how much
more, one in Perfection? He then who will take Pains may certainly,
by Practice, overcome all Difficulties, if he have Ambition enough to
fudy the beft Things. But let me not be underffood to (peak againft
the Choice of Ruins, much lets endeavour to hinder any one from
the Vle of them; fince I am fentible, that every Man has naturally a
particular Tafe for some Thing (as we have formerly faid) wherein
he may excell. I defire not to difcourage Painters of Ruins, or to

faife a Pique againlt that Sort of Objects; my only Drift, is, to thew
that we ought to fiudy the Relts of Anriquity with Care and Attenci-
on, and chely to learn the ancient Stare of old Structures, in order
to know perfectly whar they were in their bef Condition.


C H A.. VIl. Princigal Dirctions for painting the Ornaments of
Hills, Rooms, &cc.
A this Sort of Work we muft in the firtt Place have an Eye to
the Regularity and Divition of the Architecture, and if that be
beauatul, nor in the leart hure it under Pretence of Decorum, or
acting Painterlke; and if at any Time we are obliged to alter this
Condut, it mult neverhelels be in favour of the Architecture.
=. That the Painting, of what Kind loever it be, mutt cend to the
Lufire and Magniticence of the Builling; 1 speak with respect to paint-
ing the Wood-work, whether it be marbled or plain.
5. That the Ornaments to be painted agree with thofe of the Room,
and be governed by the same Order in Architelture.
4 That in Pannels, Niches and II indows ought to be artfully paint-
ed, whar you would have appear to be real or naturally there, whe
ther Tapellry or Prospect: If Tapellry, it mult appear to be fuch;
if a View, it mull look like a View; the former by being bordered,
and the latter by its sky or Sun every where agreeing with the Light
of the Room.
5. The Mafter muit beware of reprefenting in a Room z or more
different Hours of the Day at the tame Time; nor in Hiffories, unless
they be in the Alanner of Tapettry.
6. He mult never inclofe whice Marble Bassreliefs with Wood
ork, as being repugnant to Cuftom and Likelihood.
Latily, Since Excels often abates the Majelty of a Fabrick, the
Artil should avoid many Lirtienefes in the Divilions and Ornaments:
On tuch Occafions hifforical Figures should not exceed 3 or 4 Feet in
Height, be the Painting ever to large: Tapeltry-figures exceeding the
Lite are unjultitiable; they look montirous in a small Room, and let
fen a larger.
It were to be withed, that great Men and Lovers, who bepeak
tuch Works, had some previous Knowledge of fuch Things as thele;

at leaft, that they were informed of them, and would affent to the
Arcift's Opinion in the Execution of them; fince it is reafonable, that
his Delign, if it pleafes, be followed.
Few Artifls are follicicous abour Inlide ornaments, either in refe-
rence to their Elegance and Splendor, or their Ufes and Convenience ;
as is evident in many old Mafters Works, wherein we generally fee
too great a Simplicity, all is plain and mean; Tables, Be.ches, Chairs,
Kitchen ffaff, Drinking -veffels, &&c. And whars more, oftentimes a
Company of old and young People in a Room with never a Chair in
it; and fometimes, no more than bare Walls, and a Curtain hanging
for no Purpofe: Ornaments and Foliage are feldom ieen in their Works;
and when they are, they are to improperly and disjunctively applied,
that we muft conclude them rather to lerve for Humour than Decorum;
certain Signs that fuch Mafters were ignorant both of the Naturalnets,
Needfulness and Application of Objects.
Tis certain that the ancient Greeks and Romans were not originally
to fumpruous in their Houfe-furniture as afferwards they came to be;
and Tis as eafy to think, that there was a Difference between the No-
bility and Commonalty, as well in their Buildings and Drels, as in other
Respelts: The one ufed Place at his Table; the others, Earthen-ware
or painted Wood; the one had Bals-reliefs, Statues, Hangings or Ta-
peftries in his Houfe; the other was content with bare Walls; each
according to his Fancy or Ability. Truly, I am furprized to think of
my firft Ordonnances, and how disjointed my Conceptions were; often
exhibiring a royal Hiffory in a Stable or Cottage, and as often the
contrary: Quettionlets every Matler of an Houfe furnithes it with what
is proper for each partment, whether Kirchen, Chamber, State-
room or Gallery; one Apariment has a Bed or Couch and its Appur-
tenances, Chells, Tables and Chairs; another has Hangings mage or
lelscoftly, Floor carpets, Stands, Sconces, Looking-glafies, Coc. Ano-
ther has Benches, a Chimney-piece, circular Couches fitting the Ta-
ble, and other Things proper to the Room: And thus other Apart-
MERIS.
Some imagine, that Chairs were not anciently in ufe, but Mlen fat
on Cuthions, as in the Eaftern Countries, or elfe refted on Couches.

Table fland in a Corner on a Side of the Painting, and this ferving up

Ler, why the Ladies had not Chairs or Benches, and whether this Cir.
cumtance was thus to be found in Hiffory? He anfwered, that in
thote Times, neither Chairs or Benches were known; I could hardly
forbeer laughng, but asking him, whether the Company were to
Rand to their Victuals, becaute of the Height of the Table, he began
to fee his Error; ver in Excule laid, — They will make ufe of the

Ceach woice Lands jender againt the Hanging. — This would have
been a tolerable Comeoff, had the Couch been made for the Table;
but by ill Luck the one was square, the other round; I faid no more,
becaute I would not angment his Bluthes.
Others have made the fame Millake, as was the Cafe of one who,
as the Report goes, repretenting pbraham's Ofering, drew him with
a Scimica: or bending Sword in his Hand, and a fireight Scabbard by
his Side.
Ionce made the fame Blunder, when my Inclination for Compoliti-
on was greater than my Skill, in the Story of Hercules spinning by Om
thale; I had feen, in a Defign of Barthelet, that Hercules was much
bigger than anr of the Women; Wherefore 1 alfo drew him larger

and dreffed in Womens Apparel, having Sleeves clofed at Hands (like
Sardinagalus amongt his Women, in Aferians Hiftorical Chronicle)a
Diffaff in his Girdle, a Spindle in his Hand and Pearls about his
Neck; and in order to thew that they were Ompbates Cloaths, I pla-
ced her by him flark naked; now I appeal to any one, how well the
Garment could fir Omphak, feeing it was neither too short or too flreight
for Hercales, tho' half as tall again as the. Bur 1 afterwards rectihed

Iis plain, that fuch Overlights proceed from ignorance or lame in
Sruction, and princifally in what concerns Embellishment; ( fay, Em
bellishment of anr Kind whatfoever. whether within or without doors;

Effeds of it.
Te mar, from the Works of old and judicious Malters, here and
there borrow fome of their Thoughts, and ute them in a proper Ahen
Fer in our own Works: The famous Poufin, in his finding of Aigjes,
hews the Arke, with a Water-god; and with good Reafon (as we
shall prove in the Chapter trearing of the Hutberity Painters have to
regrefent spiritual and manimate Beings under human Forms) But its ir
diculous, in my Opinion, that the same Figure with all its Adjund
thould

tergod, all is well; for thinks the Mafter, — Ie fuits well—

But tis againlt Reafon; indeed, were the Sphinx and Children left
out, it may be paftable enough.
Who fets out a Room of Entertainment, and it does not thew whether
the Dinner be over or not, by the Cloth laid, Bottles, Glaffes, Cifterns,

heny and Cleepatra, in their Grandeur and Luxury, without a Re-
tinue, and as in a private Collation, feeing we know they had such a
Crowd of Mulick, Buffoons, Jugglers, and other loofe People about
them: Or can we reprefent Chriff lying in the Manger, attended by
Joseph and Mory, and the three Kings wairing on him, and that in a
Stable full of Beaft-provender, and on the Wall a Fan and Flail hang-
ing, belides other Utenfils of Husbandry, and yet not a Countryman
or Servant to appear; of a Chell, Box, Saw or Square to be feen?
whether Toseph hired the Stable, or found it void of People, is ano-
ther Confideration.) Moreover, one of the principal Figures is in a Suit
of Armour, and barcheaded, and yet his Head piece is not to be
Teen.
One of my Fellow-ditciples once painted a Collation; and I asked
him, Why be put not Knives on the Table? He antwered, That Knives
were not Antique; very well, thought I, Are then the Bread and Meat,
and a three-legg’d Stool with a Back ftanding by, Anrique?
Iis not improper, tho' a fmall Circumstance, that a Chamberpot
be placed by a Bed-fide, when a Perfon is in it; even were there allo ac
Day-break a Lampeither burning or extinguithed, and fuch like Things;
whereby we may judge, what other Circumfances are required.
From all which Confiderations ris plain, that a judicious Mafter
mult take particular Thought about the By-works; leeing tis as bad
to leave out fomething that is needful, as to add what is unnecellary.

C H A P. Vill. Of the Pictures proper to various Apartments.
HE Nature, Property and Use of Pictures in general, is, to
keep the Seafes, by a pleating Variety of Objects, as Figures,
Landskip, Cr. in a continual Employ and Contemplation.
Their Auture has a near Affinity with that of the Things they re-
prefent, when thote are done by a skilful Hand, and therefore they
can, when natural Things are wanting, fully fatisty.
Their Proverty lies in their Application to meet Places; and they
cannot be difplaced without hurting, nay undoing Naturalnels.
As for the (ye of Pictures, it is in the Occafion we have for them,
and the Places they are to ferve for, in order to gratify the Senfes of
the Owners; they mil be well expreft, and fall in with the Archi
recture in the Agreement of the various Objects with the Ornaments of
the Building.
If this be unintellisible, I shall endeavour to explain myfelf. I fay
then, that irs not tufficient for a Painter to delign Work for Apart-
ments at random, and incroduce therein what Fancies he pleafes, or
beft underflands; for, he ought to confider, whether it agree with the
Place, and be proper there; if therefore he would go on with Certain
tv, he mult, in the fir,t Place, confult the Architefture, and then the
three Points following.
1. The Qualiry, or Condiion of the Builder.
2. The Building itfelf.
5. The Apartments in it.
Firlt, Let him confider whether the Owner be a Prince, Lord, Ma-
giftrate, or Merchant.
Secondly, Whether the Building be publick, as a Town houle,
Church, Palace, Ec. or private, as for a Merchant or Citizen.
Laflly, WThether it be an Hall, Chamber, Parlour, Kirchin, or the
Like
Thus far in general: But if we build a Palace for a King, the A.
partments mull be contrived for other Ufes, than thofe for a Werchant,
or even a Town houfe; for in this latter we find many Rooms fitted
for Purpofes, oppofite to a Palace; as may be feen in that fine Model,
the Stadt houle at Amferdam, where Archicecture has wonderfully dit
posed all the Rooms to their feveral Ufes; nor is the Judgment of the

Paisters or Architelts lets confpicuous in the proper placing the Pic-
tures in each Apartment; for each Piece (chielly Sculpture) is to order-
ed, as to allude to the Room; whence we know, what Ufes the Rooms
are put to, and by the Rooms, what the Paintings, Stone-figures and
Balsreliets fignify.
Wherefore tis very necellary to contider the Nature of the Apart-
ment, in order to govern our Work thereby; as firtt
in the Hall below fuits well a grey Bassrelief; or elfe Trophies
painted on the Walls affer the Life.
in an Antichamber, where People wait for Commands, grey Orna-
ments are alto beft; fomerimes intermixed with Flowers, but very
Sparingly.
in an Audience, or Presence-reom should be Tapettries, or Pictures
with Figures, as big as the Life, of magnificent Tranfactions which
happened in Apariments or Palaces.
in the Lady's Vissting-reom mull be other Sorts of Embellishments,
tuch as Fruit, Flowers, Landskip, fine Thoughts, virtuous Reprefen-
tations, and the moft cloathed and modeft Histories.
in the Nursery agree Balsreliefs, and painted Emblems or Morals;
whereby the Children may learn good Manners, and inure their ten-
der Vears to virtuous Actions: To thele may be added, some Flowers,
Fruit, Birds, and such like.
In the Kitchin may be feen the Reprefentations of culinary Furni-
ture, Hunting of Deer, the Picture of fome Maid or other Servant,
or a Dog or Cat; but thefe mult be moftly grey or Wood-colour,
on account of the Smoke, which otherwife would fully the Colours.
in the Gallery may appear all Sores of Hunting equipage painted on
the Walls from the Lite.
in the Upper-rooms fuit Landskip, and all Kinds of beautiful Pro
Spelts.
in the Mafter's Bed-chamber are proper some beautiful Faces, and
naked Children painted after the Life.
in the Children's Bed-roomnothing mult be feen but Foliage or Branch-
Work.
The Study may be adorned with Paintings, in grey Marble, of learn-
ed Men, Philofophers, Coc.
in the Summer-house, being a Place for the Enjoyment of Company
and Entertainments, fuit nothing better than merry Bacchanalian Pieces,
portive Herdimen, Dancings, Brooks and Fountains.

Over the Dining-rosm-Chimacy place Comus, God of Meals, accom.
paned by Taffe and Smell; and on the Door, Latitia, or Joy.

Over the Hillceimney may be Decorum, or Authority, accompani-
ed by Palles, or Virtre, and Hones, or Honour; and on the Deor,
Underftanding.
Orerthe Lidrs Fifsing-room Chimney, Modelty, accompanied by Obe
dience and Diligence; and on the Door, Fidelity.
Orer the Chimney in a Saloon, or Meetingroom for Vouth, may be
feen Incentus, or Youth, artended by Grace and Eloquence; and on the
Deor, Gaudiar, or Jor.
Over the Nursery-ceimney place Education, and by it a young Branch
tied to a Stick; and on the Door, Obedience.
Over the Kitchinchimney, Prudentia, or Prudence, accompanied by
Ceres and Bacchas; and on the Door, Diligence.
Over the Bed chamber-Chimaey, Quict; and the Door Security.
Over the Study, or Closet-chimney, Wifdom, or Science; and on the
Deor, Hurpo:rates.
On the Doors of the Side-reoms going out of the Hall, Clemency
and Vigilance; and between trem, Occonamy.
On the Puntry-Leor, bundance.
On the Cellar-loir, Sitenus.
On the Garret or Left-doer, Winter.
On the Gardin-doer, Flora.
On the Orckard-dour, Pomond.
in the Grun boyfe, between the Stoves, the Figures of Perfons who
have been transformed into Trees and Plants, as Cypariffus, Myrrba,
DugEr:, &cc. On the Deor within, Apelle; and on the Outfide, Di-
yid.
On the Stabli-Goor, all Sorts of Stable appurtenances, as a Bridle,
Saddle, Houling, Stirrups, Dung-fork, Shovel, Curry-comb, Coc.
On the Prizy-Loor Momus laughing.
And now, that I may conceal nothing from the Artiffs, I shall fub
jon the Pictures proper to be put into Chimpeys; which may be vari-
ous; becaute we are not confined to the Fire, as being only uted du
ring the Iinter-feafon; the Spring, Summer and Autumn afford is a
large Field for fine Inventions; and fince the Place, for three Quar-
ters of the Vear, becomes any thing we find proper, we can either
tht them up, or leave them open, or contrive, in Niches, all Sorts of
Starves


Of Archiletture.
Chap. S.
397
Staiues or Bults, Batsreliefs and other Ornaments, as Cifterns, Vala,
Flower-pots, Baskees of Fruit, mufical Inftruments, Globes and fuch
like: We can have them be open with Doors or without, with one
Door or two half ones, and reprefent Viflos or Prospects, fuch as 2
Flower-garden, a publick Place with Fountains, a Street of Honfes,
a Grove, Lane, Froncifpiece, Pantry, Wine cellar, an Alcove with a
Couch, or a Library, and such like; in fine, we may introduce any
thing that is different from the Furniture of the Apartment. But
Care mult be taken, that the Painting have a natural and high Hori-
20n, with little or no Sky, to gain more Depth; Viffos of Apart
ments one within another are alfo not improper; but if we reprefent
Witheut-deer-Preffects as aforelaid, is more proper to paint Doors;
feemingly to give the Room Air: And feeing it often happens, that
tuch a Painting cannot have the moft advantageous Light, and is fome-
times in Shade by the Projecture of the Chimney, we should contrive
the Work accordingly, and to as not to appear like Paincing, but Na-
ture itfelf.
The Defigns proper to fuch Places (for the fake of thofe who are
not fercile in Invention) may be fuch as follow.
Spring. 1. Flora, fetting out with a gay and joyful Air, has a Bas-
ket of Spring-flowers under her left Arm; with her right Hand be-
hind the a little lifts up her Gown; her left Foor refts on a Step, and
her right lifes up; her Breaft is fomewhat to the Light; behind, in a
low Ofiskip, is feen a Parterre, ornamented with Vales: Behind her we
may place another Figure in Shade, afcending the Steps, in order to fling
off the Offskip, and bring forward the Fore-figure. Flora muft be pro-
portioned to the Size of the Fire-place; if not as big as the Life, let
her be a young Damfel, and, if the Face be thaded by the Chimney,
make good Advantage of the Reffexion: The fame Delign may be al-
to executed with Children.
Summer. 2. Pomona with a Basket of Fruit in her Lap; and in the
Offskip, an Orchard, and fome Cupids butily gathering Fruits and
Flowers.
Autumn. 3. Bacchus reprefented in an Entrance or Gateway, hung
round with Vine-branches and Grapes; and; if you pleale, a young
Satyr by him, with a Cup: This Delign may be alfo reprefented with
Children.
4 Anteros, as a Touch, crowned with Lsurels, flands on a Thref
hold, leaning on a Torch or elfe a long Arrow, pointing inwardly to
a Library, wherein are an Aftrolabe and Globe, and againtl the Wall
2Lyre

a Lyre hanging; his Garment, faftened on each Shoulder, is reddith
Furple; his Look agreeable and majeftic; his Mouth open, as if com-
plementing fomebody to come in; he flands on the left Side againt
the Door, which comes half in Shade, againtt the Offskip, to that he
is Rrongly fer off; his Face and Under-parts are fronting; his Breaft
turning to the Light: This Delign either left or right is equally good,
and to are the before-mentioned
s. Cupid is feen here fweerly fmiling, having a Flask on his Arm,
and a Spaw-water-Bortle in his Hand, which he holds up, as if he
- Rare Waters! By him is an elegant Stand or Tea-
were laving,
table, on which another Capid is placing a Silver Salver with Glaffes,
and a Silver Sugar-box and Spoon; behind may be feen a Wine-cel-
lar lighted by a Candle or Lamp; we should alfo difcover Part of a
Summer-houle, or Fountain, or a Gallery, Cc.
6. in this Delign we thew a Serenade by three Boys; the firft dreff
as a Punchanello, with a Bag-pipe, Hautboy or Flure; the second as
an Harlequin, with a Violin; and the third as a Scaramouch with a
Guitar, and all three in their proper Poftures: Harlequin in fet Po
Rure flands to the right againtt a Polt, holding the Violin to his Ear:
Punchanello, fitting againtl the other Poff on the Threshold, holds his
Fluce from his Mourh, and looks forward, laughing and thewing his
Teeth, his Head finking backwards fomewhat into his Neck: Scara-
mouch is in the middle, with his Guitar under his Arm, and his Head
quite funk into his Shoulders; he is attentive, holding his Fore-finger
to his Nofe, and his Legs clofe. Behind thefe Buffoons we might thew
2 Ballultrade over a Water in Shade, and on it an Ape fitting; in the
Water may be Condolas, with Masks in them; or elfe a Street,
and fuch like.
Becaule the Breadth of the aforefaid Opening cannot be very great,
you may, by thurcing the Door more or less, or by placing fomewhat
between it, get advantageous Shades, if the Marter require it: There
ought at molt but a Figure and half to be in the Light, and a third,
in Shade. The Colours will effect the fame. Such Paintings should
not be muddled, but boldly handled, and the Lights flrong
Thus much for Withour door- Views; proceed we now to Designs for
Crimners which are closed.
1. A Vase either of white Marble, Gold or Silver; or the Belly
Gold, and the Neck and Foor of Lapis Lazuk, in a Niche of red
Marble, or Porphyry; and the Jaumbs to be of a lighter Stone, hung
with Feltoons of all Sorts of fine Leaves, intermixed with Flowers;
thele

thefe Feffoons should be very large, like two Arms, and preading, in
order to break the light Ground, that the Middle-ornament, whe-
ther whice Marble, Silver or Gold, may have the greater Force.
2. The Buft of Borchus in whice Marble, crowned either with Vine-
leaves and Branches and Grapes, or elfe Mulberries with their Greens;
on each Side, on a Ground of Free-ftone, Feffoons of white and blng
Grapes, and between thofe may be placed some proper Inftruments,
45 Cymbals, Timbrels, Tabors, Haurboys and Pansfintes; the Buft
is on a Pedeltal of Pifan-marble in a Niche, as before; the Niche muft
rife as much as poftible, that the Bult may have its full Height; but
if the Chimaey and Niche do not admit of a Figure in full Proporti-
on, you may make a Boy of it; if you leave out the Pedeftal, you can
place the fame in the Niche, but a third lets in Height. Under the
Niche may be a faint Balsrelief of grey or other Marble; or elfe a
Feftoon of Pine-leaves, intermixed with fome beautiful Flowers.
3. The Buft of Apollo; and on each Side fome mutical Infiruments,
either painted as carved, or natural. Under the Niche may be 2
Square Pannel, and on it a carved Torch, with a Quiver acrols, thro'
2 Garland of Laurel. Among the natural Infiruments, tome Laurel
or Olive-branches; and among the carved ones, some Rolls of Paper,
with geometric and other fuch Figures; for thefe can be better order-
ed in Bass-relief, than among thole naturally painted.
4. A deep Niche; in which may be feen, a Table, with an elevant


Stand or Foor of fine Wood, partly gilt: On the Table, Ching 1ex.
furniture, as Dithes, Saucers, Tea-pot and a Silver chafed Tea-caniffer;
or elfe Cofice equipage, as a Silver Coffee-pot, a Silver Salver with
Pipes, a Knife, fome Tobacco in a Paper, a fine Chafing-dith with
Fire; and on the Ground, in the Shade, fome Bottles of Wine.
5. The Table in this Delign may be put to various Ules; it may; be
ferved fwith Melons, or Baskers of Fruit, as Peaches, Neltarips, A-
pricocks, Filberds, Coc.
6. On fuch a Table may be alfo Mufick-books and Inftruments, as
a Lute, Violin, Haurboy, Coc. And on the Ground, a Ciffern of Wa-
ter, with Bottles of Wine flanding upright therein.
7. in this lafl, we may place a round Bals relief reprefenting a fir-
ting Child, of Fleth-coloured Marble, on a blue Ground, blowing
Buables: Round it, a white Marble Moulding; and underneath, a.
Feftoon.

CHAP. IX. Description of several Pittures adapted to the five
Orders in Hrcbitefture.
IN CE no Manner of delcribing fine Apartments is more pro-
Lo per than this, which exhibits Things as it we really faw them, 1
shall therein give an rchitectonic View of each Order, and in as
confpicuous a Manner as1 myself conceive it. The Particulars muft
then be well regarded, becaute they are to linked together, that, by
overlooking a imall Circumftance, the whole Cham may be broke,
without ever getting a true Ides of the Thing.
We shall confine the Subjelt to five Apartments, and describe in
each the Pictures, which thew the Narure, Height, Cullom and other
Properties relating to the Orders of this Building: And fince the Tusan
Order, either in Parts of altogether, is rough and mafty, we shall ex-
hibit here,
The Pitture of POLYPHEMUs and GALATEA.
Polphemas, on the Sea-Thore, inflamed with the Love of the beau
tiful Galotes, who came to divert herfelf on the pleafant Surges of
the Billows, ftrove to pleafe her with his Singing and Mufick, and
thereby to gain her Favours; but the was deaf to his Suit: His rough-
hewn enormous Size, and frightful Aspect were her Averfion; where
fore the thuns him, and derides his Addreffes.
A calm Sea was feen On the second Ground, to the left, appear
ed a vall high Rock, hanging over the Sea, almoff to the Point of
Sight; all rough, and over-run with Mots and Herbage, going off to
the left very cragged; up to it huge Stones were piled on each other,
as Steps (but three times higher) from the Edge of the Warer; on the
lowermoft of them, fat the monttrous Cyclops, as a wild and favage
Man; his Skin very fwarthy and hairy; his Head and Beard full of
briftly black Hair, (preading over his Shoulders and Breaft; he had
but one Eye-brow, and that as wide as his Forehead, hanging over
the Eye (which, according to Homer, was as large as a Shield) placed
in the middle of his wrinkied Forehead; his Blubberlip turned up to
wards his broad and fiar Nofe, like that of a Negroe; thewing his
Teeth, fet like thofe of a Saw, out of his gluttonous Jaws, with 2
frim Look: By him, lay his Staff, which (like those of Herdlmen)

was crookt at one End, and (according to Ovid) bigger than the Malt
of a Ship: A Knaplack or Pouch hung at his Side; his Raiment was
Goatsskins fewed together; which he had chook from off his Shoul-
ders, poffibly to difcover to Galates his conceited fine Shape: This Gar-
ment was Cream-colour, spotted with Black. He fat very rudely,
leaning a little back againft the Rock; his left Leg was firetched out
towards the Water, and his right, with the Foor forethortened, lified
up, lay over a Piece of the Rock; his Flure, with an hundred Pipes,
he held, in his left Hand, up at his Mouth, as if he had been juft
playing. His Head inclined (with his Eye to Heaven) towards Cupid,
who ffood near and flattered him; his Mouth was open, as if he were
finging, and his right Hand, upright on his Knee, feemed to beat
time. It was curious to fee the Method Cupid took in the midft of
his Play, to stick an Arrow into Polyphemur's Breaft without his being
fentible of it.
Cupid was about half as big as the Cyclops Arm or Leg; to that,
tho' he had climbed up the fecond Step, he could fcarce reach the
Cyclops Shoulder, in order to flroke, with his right Hand, the Hair
from the Giant's Eye; when, pointing with a fretch’d Finger of the
fame Hand towards the Sea, he laughing tuck with the other an Ar-
row in Pelyphemus's Breaft, under his lified Arm; Cupid was of a begu-
tiful roly Complexion, his Hair yellowith Whice; a Quiver, tied with
a red Sath, hung by his Side, and his Bow lying near him.
The fair Galatea, in the mean time fitting on a large Sea-shell in the
middle of the neareft Diltance, was drawn by two Dolphins, encom-
palled with Tritons and Nereids, founding their thelly Trumpers, and
playing on Timbrels and other infiruments; the fat fronting in the
Shell; and the Dolphins, which the guided gently, turn’d to the right; the
was followed by other Iritons, bearing beautiful naked Virgins, and a
Crowd of Sea-monfters, who, gradually uniting with the furcheff Di=
stance, difappeared. This whole Crowd was grouped in the Form of a
Crefcent; Galaten appear’d to turpats all in Beauty.
I at firt thought this might poffibly be tenus herfelf; becaute three
Beauties attended her, whom I took to be the three Graces; but the
looked fomewhat younger, and not to wanton as Penus is ufually repre
fented; her Breall allo rofe lets, and her Head attire was quite diffe-
rent from Venus; for her white Hair, twifted in Treffes, and elegantly
howing, was here and there fruck with white Bell-ffowers; and the
Locks on each Side cied together on the Head in a Tuft, and, hanging
down both before and behind, made plainly appear, how gently the

glid over the Billows What most charmed me, was, that, in this
great Crowd, one might fee the particular Sways, Turnings and Affec-
tions of every Figure; one mored flowly, another fwiftly, as their
Beards, Hair and Vails plainly hewed; fome bending backward, as
blowing, ochers forward almoft to the Water; fome were full of
Foam; others fwimming as evenly as if they moved on Looking-glats,
to that their Glitter was fearce vifible in the Water: This second tenns
(as I call her) had a greenith blue Scarfe, which, coming over her Lap,
fined abour her right Leg; advancing her naked left Leg, the fet her
Foor on the Scroll of the Shell; her Head, a litle fiung back, inclined
to her right Shoulder; her Brealt projelting; and the right Arm,
freiching crots her Body, supported her Rein hand on her naked Knee;
her Countenance was modell and fmiling; her Eyes fomewhat downih,
made me think that the Sun was too powerful for her, but, I more
hearly perceived, the was talking to a Seanymphor Nercid, who, near
her Chariot, lay behind on a Triten, flaring towards the Shore at Po
GtBens, whither Galatea, with her left Hand a little forethortened,
was pointing; the top of the Rock was almoff thaded by a Cloud;
which Shade run crots the Piece, and fer off Gulares and her Recinue.
The whole Croup was agreeably lighted, and tho' the Light was
Rrong, yet the Shades near the Water were foff and melting, by the
Glitter or Reilexions of it, which, in my Opinion, was a fine Piece of
Conduct; behind the Rock, towards the right side, appeared beauti
ful Tracts of verdanc Land adorned with Variety of Trees, excending
Crefcent wife by the Point of Sight, and some Herds of Oxen, Goats
and Sheep were grazing; in the Offship were Hills, and on the right
Side a Town; forwards, on the fame Side in the Corner, a Piece of 2
Sea-rock appeared, which Galates and her Company feemed to avoid
As we have reprefented the Perfons of Polyphemus and Gulates, to it
will not be amits to thew thofe of the Trirons and Nereids allo: Pay-
Janiss defcribes the Tritons thus; their upper Parts, from the Navel,
were human, but covered with thin, tharp and rough Scales, and down
wards their Bodies, inflead of Feet, ended in a large fplit Tail; their
Hair long and bluith, and entangled as if in a Twift; their Eyes green
ith; their Ears, Nofe and Mourh like thofe of Men, the latter very
large and wide; their Teeth like those of a Panther; their Fingers and
Kails like the Ouclide of an Oyfter-fhell, or fuch a Subftance; on their
Breafts and Bellies and under their Ears, they had Fins like lietle
Kings, which helped them in Swimming.

Alexander ab Alexandre fays, that the Nereids are thaped like bean-
tiful Virgins down to the Navel; but the lower Parts, joining together
like a Fith, end in an Eels Tail; their Heads are moftly unveiled,
their Hair ditheveled, and befer with Pearls, Coral and other Sea-pro-
ductions.
Second Picture.
Pelyphemus, from the top of the Rock, where he fat playing, view.
ing his beloved Galates bellowing her Smiles on Acis, was to enraged
thereat, that, full of Fury, he fore a Piece from the Rock, with in-
rention to cruth them both ; which Galurea clcaped by diving into
the Sea, but Acis, not nimble enough in running, was fruck with
it.
This Piece is a Fellow or Sequel of the preceding: The Rock is
here placed on a contrary side to the former; behind it, an Ifland allo,
in the Form of a Crescent, towards the right extends acrots; beyond it
the Sea is feen along the Horizon; the Rock on the right Side goes
down in rough Steps, and follows a fandy Way forward on its left, to
the middle of the Piece, where it ends in the Frame: The unhappy
Reis falls here in the Sand under the huge Piece of Rock, with his
Arms extended, and his Face downwards, yet fomewhat turned towards
the Sea; he is not quite dead, becaute the great Weight, rolling in the
Air, only took him in the Leg as he was running; the caraged Cyclops,
not content with this, foams at Mouth, and gripes an heavier Piece of
the Rock in order to deftroy the faithless Gaurren; Riegara, with her
(moaking pitchy Torch, eggs him on, and, enffaming him with hellifh

Rock, as if they would fwallow up the Shore: On the left Side
comes Gulstea in her Chariot drawn by two Dolphins, not gliding
as before, but toffing fomerimes on the top of the Waves, and
fomerimes beneath them, with the hinder Part of her Chariot almoff
upright; the flands flooping, with her Arms fiung out, looking back
with Amazement, and her Reins flack; her difordered Locks fly in
loofe Treffes againft the Wind, cauted by her fwift Motion; her Veil,
got loofe, drops behind her into the Sea; her lovely Members are o-
verpowered by her inward Troubles; the Mutcles of her Neck, before
mooth, now rife; her Heart feems to pant, and, her Legs faltering,
the feems to fink; her Grace leaves her, and the is no longer Galarea;
Fright has robbed her of her freth Colour; and the is rather a marble
Statue, than a living Perfon
Contidering this Ordonnance I flood furprized; is it poffible, thought
I, to be a Painting! tis certainly paft my Underftanding; tis Reali-
ty itfelf; and vet it muft be a Picture; for what is too hard for the
Pencil of a judicious Marter ? Be it what it will, tis real Nature to
me, and I am fausyed. But, to proceed,
In the Offship, on the left Side, tome Ships appear in a Storm, and
two in the middle of the Piece riding at Anchor, and a Boat landing
Some People; this made me think that Twas Oliffes, who had a De-
fign on the Eye of the cruel and gluttonous Devourer of Men; it is
even fo, I can perceive them to be Greeks by their armed Gallies and
whole Equipage; the Sea is White with Froth, and the Waves beat
towards the Point of Sight; the Air is in Commotion and full of
driving Clouds, which caule here and there large Ground-fhades; the
main Light falls on Pohpbemus, and the under Part of the Rock, and
takes in almoff the whole Shore forwards; but the Stone which falls
on Ais 1s, with his Under-parts, in Shade, cauted by a bit of a Side

time above the Honion, comes flying forward, turning, full of Sor
row and Cries, to the right, down where fois lies; his left Hand is
up to one Eye, and his right (wherein is his Bow) over his Head, to
shade it from the Sun; his Quiver is reverted, and the Arrows drop
into the Sea; Hois lies on the Fore-ground, with his Shoulders bare,
and he is feen a little right fide-wile; his Hlands, half covered with

Sand, are wide open, as if he were fwimming; his Hair is dark, and his
Garment dark Creen; Golateg, between him and Pelyphemus with the
Rock, runs cross the Piece; the is feen rghe fide -wife, and her Face is
fronting; the Offskip, confifling of Hills, Bolcage, beautiful Lawns
and Rivers, is clearly lighted; there appear alfo lome Cattle grating,
as in the former Piece; under the Impendance of the Rock, and clole
to the Sea, lies a red cloth Garment in Shade; undoubtedly left there
by Acis; which was, in my Opinion, artfully contrived, in order to
point out the Place where this unhappy Couple had been fitting; the
Shore is covered with Cockles and many other Sea-productions; a
large greenith -coloured Tortoife is feen, making from under Acis to-
wards the Sea; Polyphemur's Flute lies by him, but the Bag Hill hangs
by his side; the top of the Rock is dark against light Clouds driving
thither; the Light comes from the Side of the Piece.
After I had exactly weighed all the Circumfances of the two Pieces,
I was confidering what the Mafter's principal Drift might be, and
found them to be an Example of Love, or Flattery of the Senfes wan-
tonly affecting the Body without Violence, in the Perfon of Polypbe-
mus, in the firtl Piece; and in Calatea an ealy indifference, without a-
ay Poffion; for I perceived her Motion was lmooth, and her Beauty
in its Perfection; the was not actended by any Capids, becaute fuch as
have Fins inflead of Wings ufually wait on the Wereids: I was to re-
joiced at this Obfervation, that I cant express it.
inquiring likewife what might be learned from the second Pilture,
I concluded that the Author intended to express the unhappy Iffue of
Love in the Perfon of Galatea; a Paftion both warm and ludden; for
the leaff diforderly Affection puts the chief Members of the Body in
Commotion, and difturbs the Peace of the Reft; that of Potyphemus
is violent; Capid is subject to Compaftion only, as I think; where
fore he is reprefented crying, poffibly to shew a Childithness;, for
Children commonly laugh or cry about Things which Isem. ttrange to
them.
Comment on the Charafters in the tee aforesaid Pictures.
Polyphemus, the Sicilian Herdlman, the molt favage and gigantic of
all the Cyclops, was, according to Homer, Son of Neptum and the
Nymph Tbefa; the Word Cyclops lignities, having one Eyc in the
middle of the Forehead; whereby fome would imply, the Thunder
and Lightening (according to the Greet Names of his Companions.

which they are alwars artending in Readiness at the Command of Tupi-

(Decram Orige) deliver.
Heffod lays, that Gulates, Daughter of Nerens and Doris, is to nam

to the freer llarer which falls into the Sea, becaute nothing is fvect-
or than Milk; and, by Polyphemus, the Air which loves the (weet
Food.

amine more narrowly into the Egrptian Hicroglyphies, fay, that the
Iritons, by their amphibious Form of being human upwards, and
Dolphin like downwards, are compared to the two warry Virtues,
Salmess and Sweetnels; reaching us, that both Good and Evil spring
from their Narure and Conflitucion, to wit, Good from the human
Narure, and nothing but Evil from the Fithiness; for the human Form,
Lays Prarnstys, is compared to fweer Water, which is proper for the
Aliment of Trees, Herbs and Animals; but the fithy Part is compared
to Sea-water, which is noxious to the Animals of the Earth and Air,
and allo to Plants, cauting them to die and wither; as we read, in
Platurch, Of the Narure of Teings.
Touching the derci.Is, we find in Phito, that there were an hundred
of them; Hefod lavs afir, and gives us their Names; of which Glau-

Phillodore, Euridice, Repee, Leacrthee, Spic, Thalia, Crdiffe, Puf-
thes, Lycorias, Ligea, Ephire, Opis, Afe, Cksmere and Hulia are the
principal: Their lower Parts being Fith-like has given the Pocts Oc
cafion to feign, that they were very beautiful Nrmphs who accompa-
nied their Gods, viz. the Ocean, Theiis, Neptane, and Nerens and Do-
ris their Father and Mother, and many others, who fignify the diffe

Having largely handled the Offspring and Signification of the Charac-
ters in both the aforefaid Pictures, we shall pats to a general Expli-
cation of the latter. Harmony in Mulick arifes from an agreeable
Mixture of difcording and flat bounds with concording and Charp ones;
but in Love Tis otherwife, where Diffimularity cannot be brought to
agree, or two Hearts to join, which do not fympathize by an Har-
mony of Humours: The hideous Make of the Ciclops is trightful to
the beauteous Galatea, who thuns him for her dearer 4cis; by Poly-
phemus, in this laft Story, we learn, that thole Perfons fue in vain, who
flatter themfelves that their troubleiome Addreffes gain the Affections
of thote who hare them; contrarily, Acis, bleft with the Smiles of
his Miftress, shews us the Danger of expoling ourfelves to the Refent-
ment of a powerful Rival, from whom at any time we muft expect
nothing but Death: It may allo, I fay, ferve for an Example of the
Power of Beaury, which to bewitched fors, that he could not for-
bear loving, tho' at the Expence of his Life; thus we are bewildered
by our own inclinations, and brought to the Place of inevitable Mis
fortunes, where we are plunged in Tears to the weakning of our vi-
tal Strength, as in this Fable of the young and amourous 4cis, when.
Galatea transformed him into a Fountain.
Oppofice to thefe poetic Pictures, I faw two others treating of
Love, but differencly, as being the facred Stories of Samson and Deli-
tab; the Senfe of the firft is this.

Delilab’s right Arm is about his Neck, and her upper Parts bend a

both her Hands joined under her Chin, and a Key in one of them,

forefaid Philipine walks fooping, advancing his right Leg, and sup
porting his Body with the other, which is quite bent; he thrults our
his Head, and his Elbow is drawn in, holding the Rope with both
Hands, clofe to his Body. Another, on the right Side behind him,
is lifring up a Curtain, and looking after him. Between thefe two
fifes a large Column, and another on the other Side of the latter,
whereonthe aforefaid Curtain hangs; thefe Columns and their Pedeltals
run towards the Point of Sight. Behind the laft Philiffine fland
3or 4 more. On the left Side, behind the old Woman, appears
Part of the Couch, supported by a Lion's Paw; the top of the
Couch has an Ornament of Foliage, from whence projects a Wo
man's Head with Brealts of yellowith lvory, reprefenting an Harpy,
and a fpread Wing suppores a gill Moulding. From the top of
the Couch hangs a light refiecting Drapery with Taffels down to the
Ground. Forward, in the Corner, appears a large Pillar, or a Piece
of Walling, againtt which, flands an hexagonal leafed Table, fup-
ported by three Mermaids, Back to Back, on a triangular Foot of
black Stone. On the Table are feveral Bags of Money. From be
hind the Table, a young Servantlike MMan is gently advancing, with
more Bags of Money in his Arms, looking back fuddenly, with knt

tenance, and his Hlair and Beard are frizled. Befide the Couch, below
the Sceps, fin the Shade, is feen a Starne of Venas, on a Pedeftal;
myfterioully reprefenting Affaretb. Next it, flands a Commander of
the Pbitiffines, with a Staff in his Hand; he fomewhat thrufts out his
Head, and, if I miftake not, there are more People behind him, loff

Column, flands a Center, the Smoke whereof afcends up the Column.
The Apartment is hung round with dark Tapefiries of Landskip; and
between them are broad Pilaffers. The Floor forward is inlaid with
banded Compartments.
Detilab is wantonly dreft; having a nice Head attire mixed with
Ribbons and Pearls: A long Hairrock of a brown fhining Colour,
comes over her Bofom; her Garment of whice Sattin, hanging to care-
lefly down the Bolom, as to thew her bare Breafts and left Shoulder;
the Fore-part of the right Leg is alfo naked from below the Knee; the
Thigh is forethortened, and the Sandals whice; her left Leg, covered
by the Drapery aforementioned, hangs down by the Couch, as if the
were flanding on it, with the Foot behind the Footfool; from her
right Shoulder hangs floping a beautiful fea-green Vail, tied on the left
Side; the Flaps whereof are partly on the Bed, on one Side, and
down her Thigh on the other. Samson is of a large Size, and robuft-
ly membered, of a fwarthy Hue, with black Hair and Beard, and
hairy Breatt: His Drapery is dark Purple; which, faltened with a Gir-
dle about his Body, buckled on his Side, and gachered about the Waift,
comes down between his Legs, covering the right Thigh; the Flaps
of it, finely folded, lying fidewife on the Carper. The old Womans
Head is bound with a yellowith Cloth, and her Garment Violet or
Blue, with freight Sleeves, ried under her Breaft and over her Hlips.

from a fingle Window; whereby the middle Group and Steps receive
the broaded Light. The Soldier, with the Rope, before the Steps,

a refiexed Light from the Floor. The Commander of the Pbiliffines
takes a little Light on his Shoulders. The young Man laden with the

other Bearer receives the Light directly on his railed naked Breaft.
Secend Table, or Pifture.
After Sumson's Hair was cut off, and he ried Hand and Foot, he a.
wakes, and finding himfelf thus wreechedly trapped by Delitak, arifes
full of Wrath, friking and puthing all away from him as well as he
is able; but is at latt overpowered and feized.
Here, in his Fury, he flands in the middle of the Piece, turned
with his left to the Lghr, and firaddling; his left Elbow rifes, with the
Hand and Arm down behind his Head; his right Hand comes forward,
with the Elbow puiled back by a Rope, by one of the Phitiffines; his
right Leg advances, and the left falls quire back, yielding to the
Height of his heavy Body, which bends backwards. Two Perions lie
at his Feet, either knock’d or Rick’d down, and the third lies on the
right Side, againt a Ballutrade with one Hand on the Floor, and
carching hold of the Pedettal, with the other; his Head drooping, he
Ipits bundance of Blood. On the left Side of Samson, a little for
ward, flands the Commander of the Philiffines, punching him in the
Breaff with his left Fift, and with the right (wherein he holds a Staf
on high) threaming to beat him. Behind the Commander, flands a
Soldier, who, having fiung a Rope about Samson's Neck; pulls for
ward the Ausurean Heroe's almoft mafter’d Head; whofe Mouth is
clofe, and Cheeks are (welling. Behind Samson, another flooping Sot
dier is pulling a Rope fattened to hs right Foor. The aforefaid Bal

Weapons; of whom, the foremofl, with a Staff or Half-pike, feems
to Rrike, with all his Might, at the reeling Samfon. Their Fury is
very great on this Occafion. A little to the left, behind Samson, and
clole to the Couch, Debitah is feen embracing the Statue of Venns, and
looking back with Affonishment; the is fomewhat high on the Steps;
which run crots the Piece. Juft beyond her, the old Woman, is either
flung down or falling, and with one Leg a little up, thews her Naked
nets, by reafon of her Garment fomewhat turned up; the has one
Hand on the Floor, and the other coming forwards. In the Corner
forwards hangs a Part of a large Curtain, which covers half the Ta-
mentioned in the
ble, whereon lies the Money. The two Vouths,
former, come running in a Fright, endeavouring to hide themielves
between the Table and Wall; the one is already half behind it, and
the other is looking back, with his Head between his Hands. Sam-
fon's Drapery lies half on the Sceps, and the Reidue is under his Feet;
together with fome Weapons, as Halfpikes and Head-pieces of the
Slam. The Commander of the Phitiffines has a Vellment reaching bes
low the Knces, and a loofe Drapery about his Arm; about his Head
is a light grey Fillet, faftened behind with a gold Ribbon. The main
Light takes Samfon and the Parts about him. Delilab is in a reflect-
ing Light, and deep in the Piece.
Thefe two Pictures were not inferior to the two former in Passions:
The Ordonnance, Light and Colouring furprized me, and induced me
to think, I faw the very Action and Life itfelf: I was pertuaded, that
if I knew not that it was Samson and Delifab, I muft have gueft it by
their Makes, Faces and Motions: And, what was moft wonderful, the
Falt and Drift could not only be naturally feen, but alfo its Cause,
and what the Iffue would be, whetber good or bad. In the firtt Piece, I.
could eafily perceive that Samson was to be betrayed; and if I did not
Know it, the Circumftances of his Hair cut off, Mleney told, and Ropes
at band, would make me furmife it. Vet this could not be done
without Bloodthed, as in the fecond Piece, where he is feized and ro-
ped like an Ox for the Sacrifice; who, if the firft Blow fail, roules,
puthes down, and tramples under Foot all that he meets with; xill, at
ength cired, he is maftered, and thus led back to the Alfar again.
Jull to it appeared to me. Truly, we fee few fuch Pieces to efficaci-
outly exprefted; every thing, as, the Apartment, By-werks and Inci-
dents were to proper, to needful to explain the Matter, that the O
miffion of any of them would have made the Ordonnance imperfect.

nets of this heathenifh Woman! Does not the naughty old Womas,
with the Key in her Hand, plainly thew, that thes in her own Houte,
not in that of Samfon, or the Commander of the Philifines? Or of
what Ofe would the Money on the Table be, if we faw not, by the
Bearer, that it was not Samsons? For he is afleep, and the Money
now brought in: But if, on fuch an Occafion, the Running of the Bear.
ers and the Noife of the Money be thought improper, as difcovering
the Plot; I fay there is no impropriety in it; fince its poffible to run
bare foored over a marble Floor, without any Noife, and to fet down
Bags of Money without rattling. All here is huth; no body (peaks,
for every one knows his Bufinets.
In the fecond Piece, Delilab makes to the Statue for Protection:
Why does the fly, and why in such Fear, after Samson is bereft of his
Strength? yet the cannot be eaty; the is tolfed between Hope and Fear,
and her Anxiety makes her carch hold of any thing the meets with;
and, as long as Sumfor is prefent, the retains her Trouble. The Com-
mander's paffionate Motion is, I think, very proper; for tho' he be
ditcharging the Duty of a Servant, it's eafy to imagine, that, feeing
the dead Bodies he about him, he would not have expoted himfelf to
the Danger of approaching Samson, had he not been fecurely tied:
Now, ruthing from his lurking Place, he falls boldly on Somson; poffi-
bly, not to much to thew his own Valour, as to (pirit the others; for
he looks not at Samfon, but at the Soldiers. The old Woman's lying
tumbled down is not improper, as being feeble -legg’'d and full of Fear:
And altho' the have no Share in the Action, yet 17s not repugnant to
the Story, if only for Delilahs fake; and for the fame Reafon the
is fiung into Shade. Her Garment turned up, can be no great
Scandal to an ill Woman.
Let us now confider both the Pictures; but chieffy the Signification
of Samson'’s Hair, and the Love of Delilab.
We read briefly in Scripture, many Things touching the Hair of
Samson; of which he was very careful; becaute, whilft it grew, it be-
came longer and thicker; whereby he gained greater Strength for
breaking the Ropes, with which he was at any time bound: But, be
ing cut off, his Strength forfook him, and his whole Body was fub-
jetted to Weakness.
By the Perfon of Samson the Nazarean, we underfland, a Man cho
ten by Heaven, and devored to its Service; for the Men of that Or-
der took, as I have faid, especial Care of their Hair; which gave
them Virte, adorning the Head, i. e. the Underffanding; which, the
more it increafes, the more courageous we become againft the Af
faults

Lules of our Entmiea By Enenies endeamouring to bind yr, we under
Hand, buman inclinations, and the Fire of Concupifcence. When now,
thro' Frailty, we are feduced by this Delilab, those corrupt Affections,
whereby the Lult of Steep overpowers us, and we flumber in her Laps
right Reafon becomes ufeless, and we ceafe to do good. Thus we are
fhorn by the Wiles of Women; that is, by means of Voluptuousness, ws
are deaf to the Impulfes of the Spirit; and then of courle he open to
our Enemies, both to fcorn and cruth us; for worldly Affairs are fo
affelting, that they have no fooner got the Maftery, but we find our-
felves croffed, either by Covetoulness, Love, Hatred, Jealouty, or o
ther Difquiet: But returning to ourfeives, or gwaking, we become fene
fible of our Folly, and thro' Contrition, gradually recover our Hair,
and thereby our Strength; and then, dying to Sin, we at once over
come both ourseives and our Enemies.
The Hair cut off allo implies, the Weakness of the Faculties of the
Soul or Spirit; or even Death itself.
Earipides reltifies, that Alceffus could not die before Mercury came
from Heaven to eat off his Hair. Mines likewife could not overcome
King Nisus, unlels his fatal Hair were cat off by his Daughter. And
Dide, fays Virgif, could not die before June, who piried her long A-
sony and lingering Death, fent Iris to releafe the Soul from corporeal
Fies, by cutting off her white Hair, and offering it to Pisto.
Thefe two laft hifforical Pictures differed from the two preceding
in this, that they were not mixed with poetic Figures; as Cupid, or
Love; Megarg, or Rage, and fuch like, to help the Exprettion of
the Passions, or Meanings; fince is certain, that real Trath could not
be difcerned from Fittion by a Nixture of both. And altho' the Sta-
tue of Venus, in this Matter of Faft, feem to be of that Nature, yet
is nothing to the main Point, but ferves only to thew, that the Place
was beatheniss, and where probably fuch Figures were common among
that People.

following Pictures.
The valiant Hercules, after having performed many, wonderful Ex-
ploits, not able lonser to refiff the indignation of Tuno, his Step-mo-

ther, thro' fnarting Rage buuned himself; occafioned by the poiioned
Shirt of Reffas, which Deinira had feat him, our of Jealouty, thar
he loved loke, Daughter of Euritus, King of Occalia. Tupiter much
concerned at this, carried him to Heaven in a triumphant Chariot, and
placed him among the Stars, in the Number of the Gods.
This Proffect wes will, woody, and mountainous. In the middle
of the Piece, a little to the right, near the Point of Sight, was feena
large Pile of rough Wood lying crols-wife, not as chopped, but rent
2under, having Roots and Branches. The upper Wood was small;
and the under very large, lying parallel with the Piece. Here the
unhappr Heroe, the scourge of Monlters, was lying extended over his
Lion’s Skin, with his Head to the right, and Feet to the feft Side
turned fomewhar backward, and his Breaft leaning over. His Face a
liitle riting, and bending forwards, was feen in profile from, the
right Side, diecovering Relignation, unartended with Pain.. His left
Arm was quite raifed, with the Hand behind, under his Head; the
other Armlay our a little forward on the Wood; with the Hand
half thur, and the intide cowards his Body. His right Knee was whol.
by drawn up, with the Foor inclining towards it; the other Leg was
repretented hanging off, as if he would life himself fomswhathigher.
Philoffetes, before the Wood, a lirle to the right, kneeling on his left
Knee, fupported his bent Body on his Elbow and the right Knee. He
looked downwards, holding, before his Face, a Part of his Garment,
as if he were weeping, and, with a Torch in his left Hand, fetting
Fire to the Wood in the Middle of the Piece, behind the Pile, on
the second Ground, was feen a triumphal Charior, finely adorned with
Carring and Gilding, and Children with Garlands of Palm; the fore
molt Wheel, like a Star, appeared indeways, half behind the Ground;
and the Horfes turning to the right, almoff fronting, got fomewhat
higher. Afercary was leen entire to his left Foot, which was hidden
behind the Ground, on which Foor, leaping; back,, be supporied
himfelf. He advanced, with his right Leg forwards, towards the
burning Pile, with his right Hand behind him, wherewith he drew
in the Rem, as if he were going to stop; looking back, he was at
cofling Tuiter, riding on the Hir, and pointed at Hercules with his

pointing upwards with his right Hand, and Scepter, cross his Body,
and in his lefe holding the Thunder againtt his Thigh. Behind the
Chariot, above Hercutes, to the right side, the Ground rofe up hilly.
Behind the Horfes were feen high Pine -trees and Cypreffes, and some
broken Stems; and behind Bfercury were others, fomewhat lower and
further. On the left side, up to the Horison, appeared the Sea; and,
not far in it, a Rock almoff in the Form of an aftrighted Man; which
I judged to be the unhappy Servant Lychas, who was flung into the
Sea by 1 s Mafter's Fury. On the before-mentioned rocky Hill, food
a (moaking lar; and next it, a burning Fire-pan and the Club of
Hercutes. In the Pannel of the llar, was caryed an Eagle with o-
pen Wings, and the Thunder in its Bill; ficting on a Feltoon of Oak-
leaves. In the Front of the Piece, on the left Side, lay a very large
Body of an old Tree, fore up by the Roots; and the Hole in the
Ground, thereby made, was fill apparent; the Roots, abounded with
Fibres, and the other End came forwards to the middle of the Piece,
where it went into the Frame. Here and there lay some May-branch-
es, and Stones thrown off their Bafes. On the Ground, by Psilacte-
tes, lay Hercules's ivory Bow and Quiver, adorned with Gold, and of a
Size bigger than ordinary; the Strap being cariched with gold Buckles.
On this Quiver was a small nlaid or chaled Figure repreienting Atro-
pos, the latt of the fatal, sifters, with her Scifiors.
This Piece was flrongly lighted from the right side; a little front
ing. The Hill, and Alcar, and Hind- part of the Chariot, were motily
in the Shade of the Trees. The Fore parts of the Horfes, and the
Opper-pares of Afercury, half way his Thigh, were in the Light;

a little inwardly, and eleganily wrought with Gold and Silver; a
larse white Feather hung from it carelefly on the Ground.
The naked Bodr, on the Pile of Wood, appeared very beautiful;
the Breaft, fomewhat heaving, received a Rrong Light; the Mufcling
of the Stomach and Ribs was well expreft, but on the rms and
Legs fancly; the Toes of the right Foor, which had yet fome Mo
tion, thrunk inwardly; his Eyes were dying, and the Balls drawn co-
wards the Corners; the Mouth, fomewhat open, feemed either to
fend forth Sighs, or fetch Breath, or utter, for the laft Time, some
moring Words; which raifed the utmoft Sorrow in Philotfetes, and
melied him into Tears, as I thought. Mercury was almoff naked;
having only a fmall green Silk Scarf about him, wherein fluck his
Caducess. The Horfes were winged; and the Head of one appeared,
but that of the other was hid behind Atercury.
This Piece was particularly remarkable for the Death of the Heroe;
and did not ill agree with what we have before in this Work obferved,
touching the Condition of a Man in a very hot Summer. Owellionless,
the Poifon not only worked his Body ourwardly, but inflamed and confy-
med his very Enrrails: For this Reafon, I alfo thought he muft die.
His Breath was mifty, and his Mouth gaped after Coolnets; his Exe-
lids, fliff and heavy thro' inward Heat, he could hardly keep open;
his Sight fmothered by the Steam, and its Motion recarded by the
Slackness of the oprical Nerves, drew towards the utmoll Corners
The Sweat broke out and he thined with Wetness thieffy about the
Breaft, over which waved a thin Damp, like the Fumes of boiling
Water; which made his Out line nite with the Ground: In this Part it
was, that the unhappy Heroe had the moft Feeling; and where the
Blood, leaving the Members and feeking for Shelter, was retiring to
the Heart; his Breaft was fwelled, and, as he ferched Breath, heaved
and fet; his Belly was fallen in, and the Ribs were prominent; his
Upper-parts to the Navel, were of a warm and fiery Colour, yet freh
and beautiful, as was allo his Face; his Lips were not as yet dead nor
pale, but his Hands and Feet almoff burned black; his Eye-brows
appeared drawn fomewhat upwards, as one who, tho' fleepy, srives
to keep awake; the Arms and Legs were bare, pale and thrunk, as
partaking of Death; but the Fingers, Knuckles, Knees, and Toes
were Violet, heightened with Vellow; about the Ribs and Belly were
seen some red and violet Spots of the Poifon; and his Linnen thoved
underneath at the Navel, hung in Rags, the major Part whereof was
under his Body and Thigh, and partly ftained with Blood. Thus the

piter, very much moved, cafl his Eyes downwards fidewife on the pi-
tiful Body, and spake to Mercury, who looked up at the celeftial Ru-
ler, with Concern, as if he were faying, — Look Fotber! He is
expiring. No People were feen thereabouts, except thofe before men
cioned; nor any Satyrs or Woodgods. Iis certain, that if any have
been there, Hercules frighted them away in his Rage. The Sorrow of
Philotteres was, in my Opinion, inexpreffible, and the Arriff therefore,
with Reafon, had covered his Face. But why Paans Son should be
with Hercules, without Servants, I could not apprehend; but fancy'’d,
it was, becaute the Painter thought it unneceffary, this Bofom friend
alone fufficiently explaining the Matter; a fecond Reafon might be,
becaute the Poet mentions nothing of it; and lattly, becaute the Mat-
ter clears itfelf fo well, that any Addicion would alter it, and, inslead
of an unexpetted 4ct, make it rather appear as a premeditated Funeral
Solemnity. Whence, we may well infer, that the Pile was not prepa
red for him, but that he himfelf made it on a fudden; as the Poet
relates.
This atful Piece was remarkable for thefe three Things naturally
and plainly expreft; to wit, the Fact irfelf; what preceded, and what
followed. The Beginning of the Tragedy was, when, having receiv-
ed the poitoned Shirt of Neffus, by Lychas, he offered it at the Altar
to Tupster his Father. The Sequel of his Rage appeared by that un
happy Wretchs being cafl into the Sea, and metamorphifed into a
Rock; after which, he burned himfelf; and his fucceeding Triumph
was shewn by the Charict which Tupiter fends him for his Deificati-
on. Renafcitur ex Junere Phanix.
The Conclutions to be made from the Perfons of Nefus, Deianira
and Lychas may be thefc.
We learn from the Centour how dangerous the Gifts of Enemies
are; the Caufe of the great Heroe's Death. In Deiaring we difcover
her imprudent and indifcrect Paftion, and the Effelts of her Jealouty;
which made her the Inttrument of her Husbands Death; and in Ly-
chas, we obferve the miferable Reward of his Services, and that the
Misfortunes of Servants are fomerimes by the Great to conftrued as to
render Obedience and Difobedience equally culpable.
Over the Door, oppofite to the former Piece, was feen another in
an Oltagon, equal to the Width of the Door; which I took at firft to
be a Gap in the Wall, becaufe it was a litile darkith; but approach
ing, I found it thus.

Amphitrye, being with Alemeng in her Bed chamber, had, before
he went to Bed, laid the two Children, Ipbiclas and Hercules, in his
Shield, under a Pavillion; into which, June, full of Spite and Rage,
call two Serpents, in order to devour the two innocents, especially
Hereales; who (queered them to Deach, and flung them at Amphitryes
Feet.
Forwards, on the left Side, one Step high, were feen the two Chif
drenlying in the Shield, encompatted with a Balluftrade running from
the forepart of the Piece towards the Point of Sight, and which took
up two thirds of the Piece. Ampbirrys, at the Children's Cry, leap-
ing out of Bed with an undrawn Sword in his Hand, came to lee
what was the matter; and, having one Foot on the Step, he met with
the young Hercales, looking at him with a Smile, and grafping, with
borh Hands, one of the Serpents, which he fqueezed to Death; the
other lying already at his Feet. Amazed at this, Anphitrye farced
back: The other Child, bawling out, lay, half rumbled out of the
Shield, with a Pillow and Part of the Cloaths on the Floor. Behnd
Hercufes, and beyond the Shield hung the Tbeban Princes purple Man
tle over two Half-pikes, which ftuck un Clancing from the Wall, and
were tied together. Over them, a litle backward, the baulked 74-
2o was feen mounting upwards, encompafted with a dark Cloud, with
her Scepter by her side in her left Hand, and, with the other lified
up. feeming to threaten with her Fift, and looked down frowning at
the Children. Somewhat further, bevond the Balluftrade, in the mid
dle of the Piece, role 4 or s Step:, feiched in by an Hland rail, reach-

middle of the Piece, was a large and deep Compassniche or Alcove,
having a Curtain drawn up and faftened, on each Side, with two
Kings; herein ftood the Bed. The Apartment was 8 Feer high, and
hims with Tapefiries; and over them, as far as I could perceive, the
Wall was divided into Pannels, wherein were some faint Batsreliess, re-
prefenting warlike Acts. On the left Side of the Alcove, in the Corner,
was a round Pedeftal or half Column, whereon ffood a burning Lamp

Hindworks were feen, by the Torch, in a dim Light, except the
Corner wherein the Lamp food; which, with the Door, adorned with
fine Foliage, thewed fomewhat Rronger. From June proceeded fome
light Rays, darting on the Children and thereabours. This Light was
not like that of a Candle, but of the Day or Thunder: It mottly fell
on the Under-parts of the Child in the Shield; his Upper-parts and
Head, with fomewhat of the Pillow, tumbled out, were in the Shade;
he turned in the Shield his Opper-parts one Way, and his Under-ones,
another; which were forethortened. Amphitrye's Upper-parts, almoft
to the Middle, were in the Shade of the Clouds, receiving frong Re-
fexions from the Children and the Floor. I food pondering, how
Alemend came by the lighted Torch; but, on a narrow Inspection,
found a large gold Candleflick ftanding near her, by the other Pedeftal;
and I wondered why Alcens's Son had not taken it, yet, on further
Confideration, concluded, that, thro' Hurry and Fear, he overlooked
it, as ufual on fuch Occations; which Afemens perceiving, the proba-
bly jumped, out of Bed and fezed it. Such was this Picture. Thefe
thiee Lights were finely and diffinctly obferved: The Lamp,
which
was diftant, gave a whire or pale Light, but lomewhat foggy
The
Flame of the Torch was, almoft to the Wick, covered by the Clouds
under Juno; which, as far as I could apprehend, was an artful Sleight

which otherwife he muft have done for the fake of Naruralness.

I was furprized that none had their Badge, of Diflinction, except
Tafirer, riding on his Eaole, and holding the Thunder, and Atercury
with his Cadurens in his Hland, and Wings on his Feet: But on Conti-
deration, that the Gods are well known to each other, I directed my
Eye to Hercules, and obferved, that he was without his Club and
Lion's Skin; which induced me to think, they were burned with his
Body; neverthelets, his frizled Hair and Beard, and fine Mieh, con

Cornice, and thereon s Paparet with Pannels, from which fprung the
Coving of the Cieling, in the Middle whereof was this laft mentioned
Piece in an oval Compartment of Oak-leaves and Acrons. The Me-
copes in the Frize were adorned with Foliage of the Same Sort of
Leaves; and in the Pannels of the Paraper were Feffoons, with 2.
Crown of Laurel hanging at them. Between the two firft and latt
Columns appeared other Feftoons in oblong Pannels; and undereach,
a Club and Lion’s Skin: Thole Feffoons were compoled of Palm-
branches with their Fruit. On both Sides of the Door, between it and
the firtt Column, ffood a Palm tree, whofe Branches reached up to
the Coving, projecting very elegantly over the before -mentioned
Pilture. Thole Palmtrees, with the frizal Ornaments, were bronzed;
the Architrave and Cornice, of ferpentine Stone, and the Frize, like
the Columns, Pifan Marble. On each fide of the Door, between.
the two firff Columns, was a large Bassrelief of plain light and
yellow Marblc. The one repreiented Hercules afleep, furrounded
by the Troop of Pigmies. The other shewed his awaking, and hiding
them in his Lyon's Skin.. From this firtt Proof of his Valour, he
afterwards got the Name of t Hercules Primogenitus. On the other
Side of the Apartment, oppofite to this laft, Hercutes was feen fpin
ning by Ompbate; and, in the other Pannel on that Side, his thooting
Nesus. Round the Cieling-piece were twelve fmall circular Pannels,
jomed together with Wreaths of Palmleaves; thefe exhibited, in
faint Batsrelief of Freework, the Labours of Hercules. Between:
them and the Piece appeared some Lion's Heads.
hre we proceed in our Relation, let us thew what the Heathens uns
derfood by the Deification of Hercules.
Hercules, the Glory of valiant Men, shews us, by his Deification;.
that thofe who attempt that Honour in their Life-times, as Autbony.
with his Chopatra did, or strive to obtain it by intreating and cajoling.
the People, as moft of the Persun Kings and Romulus did, milake the
the right Method; whereas Herculess whole Life was taken up in:
freeing the World from Monfters and Tyrants; and no Divine Honours
were paid him till after his Death; for Eternity, which he obtained
only by Death, teaches, that true Virtue will not be flactered in this
Life; as Aexander proved to thofe who were before hand for calling
him a God, by shewing them the Blood which iffued from his Wounds,.
in the fame Manner as from other Morcals. How powerful and virtuous.

foever a Man may be, as long as he draws Breath he cannot call himfelf
Bappy, as being no more exempted from the Teeth of biting Envy,
than ffercales was in his Life time. The Heathens worthipped him as
2 God, according to their Superflicion; believing alfo, that though all
Souls are immortal, vet thofe of valiant Men, purfuing Virtue, at-
tain an higher Pirch of Honour, and partake of the Deity: They even
altign him, in Heaven, Hebe, the Goddess of Vouth, for a Confort, on
account of his Strength, which is found only in Vourh.
Thus, in After-times, the Philofopher and Poet Empedocles, vainly,

2s Bracelets, Necklaces, Jewels, Coc. and her Diadem, in the Shape
of a Prramid, befet with Stones. Behind her Chair, food a young
Damfel, holding a gold Plate with some Cups, Pots and litile Boxes
of Perfume. Behind this Virgin, appeared two others in Surprize
and mutual Embrace. On the ieff Side was an old Matron, with her
Back fronting, holding an opened Letter in her left Hand. A lirtle
more towards the middle, another Virgin was pulling away, from the
Table into the Corner forwards, a little Fountain elegantly wrought, and
relting on four Wheels. In the Fore-part of the Piece, on the right
Side, a Meffenger was kneeling before the Queen quite dejected. At
the further End of the Apartment, in the middle, was a Gate-like
Opening, and on each Side of it, a Term, of white Marble, whereon
hung some warlike inftruments. The Room was hung with Tapettry.
The aforefaid Gate thewed an Entrance into another magnificent A
partment, adorned with Balsreliets and other lmagery: At the fur-
ther End of it was feen a large thallow Niche, and under it a broad
Pedeffal or elegant Seat, on the Side of which fat the Figure of a
Woman, with the Feet towards the Light, holding in its Lap a Clebe,.
whereon the right Hand, with a Scepire in it, refted. Iis Head was
adorned with a tripple mural Crown. Over it, in the Niche, ffood,
batsrelief like, a grave Man, in a majelic Dress, relting his right
Hand on a Truncheon, and having a Torch in his left. He was
crowned with Flowers, and about his Neck hung a gold Cham. This
Figure was Golden, and the Ground of the Niche, Azure-blue. The
Columas were of white, and the Building of Egyprian Marble, and
the Ornaments Gold. Behind the Matron, at the End of the tirll A-
Parement, a young Damfel, by the Queens Order (which the Mlatron.
lignitied to her) was climbed up, reaching with one Hland as. high as
the could, to take down some Arms off one of the Terms; which the
Matron, with the bent Fore-finger of her right Hand, beckoned to
her to bring forwards. Whereupon the Dumiel looked back as. the.

Miatron had a long cloth Garment of dark Fillemot, gold bordered;
her Under-garment, as well as I could perceive by the Sleeve, was
dark Violer, and her Head elegantly wound with Fillets of many
Colours, the Ends whereof hung down her Back. The Virgin, who
took down the Ieapons, had a pale apple-bloffom-coloured Garment.
The Melfenger was feen fidewile, a little hindwardly, in a small
sold fringed Mantle, dark Grey or blackith, hanging halfway down
his Back; his Under-coat was light Grey, and reached below the
Knees; his Buskins were of Beatts Skin; he had a Dagger by his
Side, or ttuck in his Cirdle, with a small Staff in his Hand; his Hel
met, having a Dragon’s Head, and two Wings on top like thofe of a
Bat, lay by him; his brown Skin thone with Sweat, as did his Hair,
which was not long, yer ried behind.
The Apartment received its Light from the right Side, through a
large Compals headed Window, which fell firongly on the Qucen,
and about her, a little forward : She cauted a Groundshade on the
Corner of the Table; by which the Marron'’s Under-parts were well
fet off. The Meffenger was moftly in Shade, as being more forward
than the Window. The Hangings, between the Window and Gatewaj
were half in Shade; which for the Princess and the Attendance be
hind her frongly off: In one of thofe Hangings (which were very old,
and of a dark Purple Colour) was wrought, in coftly Needle-work,

and the marching of and Divifion of the People. and above, about the
Sweep of the Gate, as round the Edges of a Medal, were some Syriat
Charalters or Letters. On the right Side,, over the Hangings, the
Apartment appeared lighter, by means of two circular Windows
running towards the Point of Sight. The Cieling was coved. The

and the foremofl Croup, lay a large white round Stone, which
cently united with the other Light; yet without attratting the

Forward, on the right Side, behind the Meffenger, some Steps went
down to a Door below. Thro' the Window appeared the Offskip, or
Part of a Palmtree.
I forgot to fay, that the Weapons hanging on the Terms confifted
of Quivers, Bows and Swords. in the Bafon of the golden Fountain
ran a Spout of Water, upon a Cloth or two, and a Spunge lying in
it.

A martial Fire feemed to inflame her Heart; which gave a Glow to
her Cheeks; her kyes (parkled like two Stars. If the had not an
Helmer, I should, by her Dress and Accoutrements, have taken her
for a Diana going a hunting. Every thing was in Readiness for her
March, even to her Robe; which the refuled to put on, contented on-
ly with a Bow and rrows and her Authority. The waiting Women
ran up and down Stairs, one bringing this, another that; one of the
chief put the royal Helmet on her Head; a Foorfiool was fet for her,
below on the Stairs, whilft the other was girding the Sword about
her. The curvetting Horfe, inured to War, ffood ready at the Stair-
foot. The Trumpers founded, and the People, full of Defire, crowd
ed about. The Paflage was cleared. The Horfe, divided into Troops,
were drawn up in the Inner-court. The Meffenger ran down the fum
ther Steps; and the Matron above, in the Gateway, was gaping and
ftaring at the Preparations. The Sky was clear, and feemed to tavour
the Princels's Enterprize.
Having, thro' Hurry, but tranfieatly viewed thefe Things, I could
not poffibly well remember every Circumftance, to as to give a true
Delcription of that excellent Piece; wherefore, attentively placing
myfelf before it, my Obfervations were as follows.
On the left Side was feen a magnificent Portico, with four lonic Co-
lumns fupporting their Ornaments; and on each Side, a Ballultrade
and Plinch, running down gor 6 Steps, to a large Pedeftal, whereon

lay Lioneffes, caped and covered, whole Bodies were full of Syrise
Charalters The Gate was circular headed; and over it a Key-fone
which fupported the Cornice, and wherein was a bronzed Lion's Head
Over each Column, in the Frize, were the fame Sorts of Heads; and
between them, a faint carved Quiver and lighted Torch across. On
each Side, in the lings of the Portico, was a Niche, the Bottoms
whereof were even with the Sill of the Door, and running towards
the Point of Sight. At the Excremities, of thote Wings, were two
other Columns, flanding againtt a Wall, which ran, on a low Ground,
to the middle of the Piece. This Wall was divided by flat Falcias,
in the Narure of Pilafters; and, between them, were circular Open-
ings, through which was feen the Inner-court, and above the Wall,
1is Side, running, deep in the Piece, towards the Point of Sight. Ar
the End of the faid Wall was fuch another, parallel with the fore
moft, which bounded the inner-court; and, further behind, some Palm
and other Trees rofe above it. On the Fore-ground, on the right
side, the Ground was rugged up to the Landing-place of the Steps,
defcending into the Fore-court; in the middle of which ftood a large
Fountain, of white Marble, refting on a Balis of 4 or 8 Arches,
which were fupported by fquire, fmooth and high Pillars, of the Do.
1it or Ruttick Order, divided by ruflicated or Rock-like Blocks; over
this Work arofe, inflead of an Entablature, a large Plinth, three
Feet high, of whice Marble, like the Figures. On the rop, in the
middle, riting z or 4 Steps, ffood a large terreftrial Globe, lupported
by 4 Sphinses; on which Globe fat a Woman, with her Fore-parts
towards the Court, holding high, in her right Hand, a Sun, and
downwards, in her left, a Moon. On her Helmet was an Eagle with
(pread Wings, and on her Breaftornament a Lion's Head Her Dress
was like that of an Herome. On the loweff Steps, next the Plinth,
fat the four Parts of the World, fettered againtt some Trophies. Be.
low, between the Pillars, were Copperbronzed Bafons, which re-
ceived some Spouts of Water from within, out of a Rock. This
huge Pile ftood in the middle of the Piece, againft the Point of Sight,
half behind the Wall. The Fore-court was rough; and at the fur
ther End had Steps afcending as aforefaid.
Thus was the Plan of this Picture, and the Difpolition of all the
fixed Work; I shall now, to the beft of my Skill, defcribe the
Tell.
A litle to the left of the Point of Sight, the coursgeous Ovecn

der: A crown’d Helmet, orramented with a large white Feather,
was fet on her Head by another, and a third, with the royal Robe,
which the Princels thought needlets in this March) was going up flairs
again, with her Eyes lixed on the Qucen: This Virgins right Side
was a little fronting; and the held the Robe high in her lett Hand,
that it might not drag, and, with the richt, kept the reft clofe to
her Body; her dark Head actire was flrongly fet off againtt the white
Furr, of Eining of the Robe; and her Locks, thro' her fwift Mo-
tion, were ffying behind, and her Gown ruffling between her Legs:
She was girt jult under the Breall, and had white Sandals: The Gown
was open on the Side, difcovering the bare Leg and half the Thigh:
Her Garment was Rofe-colour. The Matron, near the Cate-way,
food flooping forward, and wondering, with her right Hand on the
Balluftrade, and looking down. Next the firft Scep, before the Qween,
under the Point of Sight, Rood a flooping Damfel, fetring a fmall
Ivory Footfool, covered with purple Velver, for the Qucen to mount
her Horfe by; the held it with her right Hand, and with the other
wat tucking up her Garment behind, feeming fearful of the Horfe.
A little from thence came, from the right side of the Piece, a joung
Man, looking at the Damfel, and holding, with his right Hand, a
fine Horfe by the Bridle; he was feen from behind; his left leg ad
vanced, and the right drew quite back, juft touching the Ground with
his great Toe; his Breaft projected quite over his Poife, as if he were
Kill walking; Hriking the Horfes Belly with his left Hand to make
him turn about. The Horfe's Breaft was fronting, and his right side
fomewhat forethortened; his Head in Profile; the foremolt Leg pran-
cing, and the right drawing in, as if he went backwards; his open
Noftrils were whire; as were alfo the Breaft and Legs; the reft be-
ing dark or brown: The Bridle and other Things were Gold befet
with Stones, having a rich Caparifon, fot off with gold Plates: The
Houling was Purple, richly embroidered with Gold, powdered with
Pearls and other Cofflineffes, and almoft trailing the Ground, with fine
Niction: The Mane was dreft into

girt in the Middle, was light Vellow reflelting Green; being frongly
let off againd the purple Houling; his right Shoulder, with half his
Back, was feen bare; and his Carnation, beautiful and freth; his San
dals were White. The Horie gave a Groundshade over the Damfel
with the Foorffool, and a little beyond her. Quite on the right side,
Tomewhar further, flood two Trumpetesturned towards the inner Court,
girt with Beafts Skins, and founding: Their Trumpets, almoft like
thote of the Romans, were winding like Serpents, with Dragon's Heads
at the Ends of them. On the further side of the Qucen, the Meffen.
ger appeared running down the Steps, quire over his Poife; pointing,
with his right Hland a little forethorcened, forwards at the inner Court,
with his Face towards the Qucen: By the lirtle flying Mantle behind
him, might be perceived the Swifiness of his Motion; his Action, like
that of a fiving Mfercary, being free and extenfive: He fiung out his
left Leg, and his right Foot was quite behind, and off the Ground.
The People, on the second Ground, below Stairs to the Pedeftal of the
firl Ballustrade, were feen between his Legs: Thefe People, as well
Men, as Women and Children, ffood, fome wringing their Hands,
others lifting them up high, some embracing, others clapping their
Hands; the former for Fear, the latter for Joy: Among the reft was
seen a distreted Woman, hanging her Head fideways, with her Arms
down, and Hands folded: By her flood a grave Man, talking to her
almoff Mouth to Mfouth; with his right Hand pointing up to Heaven,
and with his left, giving her a friendly Look, he pulled her by the
Sleere, as if he would have her take hearr. Some Children were lying
on, and crawling up the Steps. In the Fore-court some Troops of
Horie were leen purting themfelves into Order, and others mounting
their Horfes On the further Side of the Place, other People were
coming running down the Steps. The Offskip behind them, on the
right side, was hillr. Over the aforefaid Steps, ar a Diltante, arofe a
large Pyramid, and Come Palmtrees, appearing darkith againlt the clear
Skr. The Fore-court was light, and the inner Courcisfelf, on the leff
Side, of whice Marble. The Wall, on the furcher Side of the Steps,
was, together with the People, and beyond the Lioneffes, shaded by 2
Cloud; which frongly fet off the foremoll Group, whereon the main
Lightfell.
The Trumpetssion the fame Side, with a Part of the Ballultrade on
which they leaned, were in Shade. Forwards, in the Corner, was feen

the Trumpety who thereby were in the Shade, receiving here and
there, from the Opening, a little Light on their Under parts and Legs.
The Gare was low, becaute the Ground run off floping from the Steps;
the Ground, with the Hind-part of the Horfe being thaded by it. The
Horfeand young Manreceived (mall but very frong Lights and Shades.
The Trumpetesand Gate were rongly reflected from the left Side.
The People on the fecond Ground, againft the Balluftrade, were moftly
lighted from on high, by the Blue of the Sky, and could have no Re-
flexion, becaute they food parallel, along the Stairs. Behind the
Wall, with round Openings againtt the Angle of the Wings of the
Portico, arofe the Top or Leating of a large Palm-tree; which broke
the Length of the faid Wall; at the same time cauling the Excremities
of the Wings to unite agreeably with the Innercourt. The Portico,
fronting the Light, was, with the Balluftrades, of Pisan and Egyp-
lian Marble, with white Ornaments. The Lioneffes on the Pedefials
were of Serpentine. The upper Steps were of whice Marble with
Eyes. The large and pacious Landing, at the Foot of the Steps, was
of Free-ffone; and the Ground, on the right side, fomewhar Ruffet,
mixt with Earth.
The Matron had, as in the former Piece, a dark Fillemot Upper-
garment, over a Violetone; and her Head was elegantly wound. The
young Virgins were alfo as before. She, who girt the Princess with
the Sword, had an apple bloffom -coloured Garment; her Coat being
tucked up behind; her Hlead attire was light againtt the dark greenith
blue Garment of her, who, flanding one Step higher in the Shade, was
putting on the Qucen's Helmet. T he young Damfel below shaded by
the Horfe, was likewile drelt in Bluc. The Virgin, with the Royal
Robe, food clofe to the foremoft Ballutrade, almoft up the Stairs,
behind the Lioneffes, which were ftrongly fet off againtt her light
Garment. I had almoff forgot a coldier flanding in the Gate, near the
Trumperepwith a Club placed with lron on his Shoulder; he had a
light grey Linnen Coat reaching below his Knees, with Stockings on
his Lege, and on his Head a copper Hielmer, adorned with two Beafts
Horns; about his Neck was faftened a brownith red Beaft's Skin, with
the Paws to it, and, by his Side, a Dagger. This Man was enturely
in the Light of the Gate.
After a thorough View of this Pilture, I began to confider, wherein
iis Goodnels lay, which was what I chiefly wanted; wherefore, taking
my Pocket-book, I fet down in it the general Hleads in the following
Manner.

Being much rejoiced, and inflamed with new Ardour for further in-

the Door, the following Bats reliefs in white Marble.
in that on the right Side Semiramis was tlanding on the Fore-
ground, and by her an Archicect, shewing her, on a Board, the Plan
of 2 Townwall. On the lefe Side were Workmen, buty in carring,
hewing, curting and fawing Stones: And on the fecond Ground,
the taid Wallappeared fainly jutt above Ground, and next it was the
Town.
in the other Piece the Queen was feen on Horfeback, with a Oui-
ver behind her, and aiming at a Lion, who, rearing up, approached
her, with an Arrow through his Body. In the Oftship, the Town
wall appeared as finished, and here and there some Palmtrees. The
Figures were fmall Life, and finely wrought.
Berween thofe Bais-reliefs itood a fquare Pedeftal in a Niche, and
on it the Statue of Semiramis, with a dead Lion under her Feet. She
was dreit in the Afyrian Manner, as an Amazon, with a Bow in her
Hand, and a Quiver behind her; and on her Head a crowned Helmet,
on the cop whereof lay a little Dragon, whole Neck curled down the
Fore-part of ir. The Pedeital was Porphiry, and the Figure mafff
Gold. The Niche, like the Building, was intirely Serpentine, and
the Pillars and Pilalters of Eciptian Marble.
Orer the Niche was an oblong arure-blue Table or Fafcia, and
thereon a Pile of burning Wood, of white Marble, out of the Smoke
whereof alcended a Pidgeon.
Orer each Column was a Modillion of Olive-leaves, which support
ed the Archarare, and in the Frize were fome rms, not much
raing. All thefe Ornaments were of Gold.
in the middle of the Arch-work arole a very large Cupola, and
therein was a celeitial Sphere, of blue Chryffal, with the Signs and
Circhs

Circles of Gold. The half of this wonderful Machine took up the
Capola, shewing itfelf in fuch a Mamber as if the Sun thone on it, and
enlightening the whole Apariment for which Reafon, I did not be-
fore take notice, that the Room had no Windows. On each Side of
the Sphere were two Tables of Fret-work, and each had a Figura
In one was reprefented Strength, like an Heroine, holding an Oaker
branch, and having a Griffin on the Shield; and in the other was allo
an Heroine, fignitying petiricat Government, leading a bridled Lion
with the left Hand, and holding a Staff in the right. By which Fi-
sures and the Sphere are underflood the Heaventy Inffuences, as Philo-
lophers intimate.
The Floor was, like that in the Underapartment, inlaid with a
terreftrial Globe, juft under the Copola; where the Light, falling dr
recily upon it, made it rife, and look to relieved, that I was afraid to
walk on it.
Over the Door, in a round Compartment of Palm-leaves, 1 faw
carsed, in whice Marble, an old Sea-god, whom I judged to be Father
Occgn, leaning on a large Sea-vale, shedding abundance of Water
running cross through the Piece; out of which arofe, in the middle,
a large winged Lion. On the other side of the Sea-god appeared a
imall Hill, and thereon a little Palmftem. This Table was like a
Medal of one Depih. The Sente alluded to the firfl Rife of the Afferi.

This forrowful Triumph happened before the Capirel, at Rome, as
when in its ancient State. Forward was feen a large Plain, encom.
pafted with Walls, where lay two carred Lionclies of Porphiry, which,
is probable, the Arriff introduced, in order to make the Place the
more remarkable; and tho' it may be doubted, whether they have
been of to long standing, ver we may eafily admit it. On the right
Side was :epretented the proud Capirot, of Marble, and collly Archi
recture after the Rovm Order, alcended by a lpacious Flight of Steps.
On the top was this Intcription in Gold Letters, SENATUSPOPV.

as followed, shearhing his Sword. Behind him, his unhappy Sifter
dropped down backwards. The People, from all Corners, flocked to
gether, muttering and cufing his Cruely; but he, regardles of it,
boldly went forward. Before the Steps, about 7 or 4 Paceslength, the
Ground was paved with large grey Stones; the Refidue being rugged or
uneven. The foremoll Weapon bearer, entering the Gare, held his
Trophy fomewhat flooping within it: He was leen from behind, hav-
ing almoll the fame Altion as the Gladiator, his left rm excended,
and his right Leg on the Threshold. The fecond, two or three Steps
down, held his Weapon up againtt his Body, looking back at the
third, who followed clole, and was speaking to him. This poifed on
his left Leg, having his right very much bent, and the Toes of it on a
Step higher; his Upper-pares fwayed a little to the left, with his Head
forwards; holding the Pike, in his left Hand, againtt his right Breaft,
and the Bottom of it with his right Hand. The chird carried the Tro-
phy on his Shoulder almoff upright; his Breaft projecting, and his
Back fwaying a little forwards, with his Elbow flanding out, fetting
his right Foor on the Steps; the left being quite behind, and off the
Ground, as walking on; and the other before him, as a little flooping.
Thofe three Men were called Velites, or light armed, and dreft in Lin-
nen, girt about the Middle, with Daggers by their Sides, and plain
Helmets on their Heads; as we fee in the Prints of Trajan's Column,
and other Remains of Anciquiry. Three or four Steps from thence,
jull in the Middle of the Piece, Horatins advanced in full Armour,
holding an Olive-branch befide his Scabbard in his left Hand, and on
the fame Arm, (which, with the Elbow, was putting out, and a little

forethortened) a fmall Shield, whereon was reprefented a Lion. His
Breaft was fronting, and the right Hand lifted up and theathing his
Sword. His right Leg was put forth, fomewhat bent, and the other
drawn far back, in the Shade of his Body, as if he were flepping
forward in hafte. With his Face fronting he looked down on the
Scabbard; having on his Head an Helmet crowned with Laurel and
Oak-leaves; with a Feather behind, which, by the Turn of his Head
and the Swifinets of his Walk, flew to and fro. A Mantle, faftened
on his right Shoulder, and tucked under his Chin, hung a little over
his left Shoulder; one Flappet of it flew behind, and the other for-
wards, flinging over his left Leg. The Straps under his Coat of Ar-
mour and on the Arms were short and broad, and rounding at Bot-
toms. His Buskins came half-way up the Legs. A little from him
forwards was feen the expiring Virgin, falling back, with her Feet ex-
tended towards him, and Arms (pread wide, the right lifted up, and
the left finking; her Breaft turned to the Light; her right Hip fvel-
led, her Thigh was at full Length, and the Leg a little forethortened;
the left Leg hid under the right: Her Face, allo forethortened, lean-
ed towards the right Shoulder, which, with a little of the Breaft,
was naked; her Breaft-garment, girt under the Breaft, was fying up-
wards; her Upper-garment finking, fhing over her right Leg, and a
Flappet of it hung over her left Arm; her light Treffes, by her Tum-
ble, flew upwards. Beneath her, a little more to the left Side, was
an aged Woman supporting the noble Virgin, and, hricking out, be-
holding the Murcherer; the, with her Breaft downwards, and left
Hand on the Ground, and right Hand lified up, was staying, with
her Body, the Back of the droppine Roman Virgin: Her Head
was wound with Cloths and Fillers. Jult behind her appeared the
half of a Pedeltal, whereon lay one of the aforefaid Lioneffes; and,
fomewhat further behind the Fellow of it, running towards the
Point of Sight Two Soldiers followed Horatius; who, in Diffatif-
faction, feemed to turn back. Not far behind the Conqueror were
some Spectators highly difcontented; some were pointing at him,
some menacing, others disdainfully turning their Backs upon him,
5c. It looked as if we heard them grumble. On the Fore-
ground, on the right Side, an aged Man, with one Shoulder bare,
came haftily running to fee what was the Marter; he had on a short
Coat, with an Herdimens Cap on his Head, and a Flute and Scrip
at his Side; his Under-parts were, with part of the Fore-ground,
in Shade, and his Back fronted the Light. A Dog ran before, look-

ing back at him, according to the Cultom of thofe Creatures. Beyond
the Cupitol, Part of a Wall, with its Architrave and a large compass-
headed Gareway, ran towards the Point of Sight. This Wall extend.
ed from thence cross through the Piece, by the Point of Sight, to
the left Side, and was divided by ruflicated Doric Pilafters, into
Squares, wherein were fmall Niches. Out of this Gate, juft below
the Wall, some Cartle, as Oxen, Cows, Goats and Sheep were coming,
with a Shepherd, who, at the Noife, was looking back. This Shep-
herd and Cartle coming in at the Gate, made me believe, he came
from the Marker, becaufe it was behind the Capitel. Over the Wall
appeared feveral fine palace-like Buildings; as allo a Column, where
on was placed a She-wolf, with the two Children Romulus and Remus.
Above the Angle of this Wall, on the right Side, in the Offskip,
was feen, as well as I could guess, the Rock Turgerd, riting up very
high; but neither the Pantheon, Mente Cavalle, Vatican or Coloffeum,
as not being as yet known: No Ruins nor broken Buildings appeared
here, but all beautiful and whole, except fome little Houfes; fince
the Town had not been an hundred Vears tanding, nor before ruined.
On the left Side, forward in the Corner, on a ruing Ground, food 2
Woman by the Trough of a Fountain, aftonithed and crying out, who
feemed as if the were going away; lifting up one Hand on high, and
holding out the other to a young Girl, who came running in Confuli-
on. A Child, held by another Girl ficting on the side of the Trough,
was looking down on the Ground on an overturned Pot of Milk. This
Fountain Hood againtt a large Pyramid, which run towards the
Point of Sight. several ordinary-drelt People, Men, Women and
Children, came running in Groups, z or 4 together, from behind the
Pyramid; others were recurning from thence. The young Girl, who
came running in Confulion, had a thort Coar, and was barefoored, and
her Hair very meanly ced behind. Thefe People and Objects with the
Pyramid, filled up almoft a fourth Part of the Piece. A Row of low
Houtes, like an Hamlet, ran by the Pyramid towards the Point
of Sight; and above them arole fome Pines, Cypreffes and other
Trees.
This Piece was lighted from the right Side, yet a liile fronting.
The Crpirof gave a large Ground shade over the Steps beyond the two
Arms-bearers, and continued beyond Horatins, over two or three Men,
who ftood behind him, againtt whom he was flrongly fet off. The
Side -walls, with the Gare, reached half the Height of the Building; the
same receiving (lrong Refiexions from the Ground, and having Ground-
Shades

thades which were not too tharp. The Pyramid, with the Women
and Children, was kept fomewhat darkith, by reafon of a Cloud; ex-
cept the top of the Pyramid, which received a clear Light. The Sky
was full of Clouds, especially in the middle, and on the left Side of
the Point of Sight, behind the Houfes.
The Romans, in thofe Days, except People of the firlt Rank, wore
little of no Variety in the Colours of their Cloaths; they were moft-
ly white, or elfe light grey Woollen. For this Reafon, as I conjec-
ture, the Deligner of thefe Pictures had made the principal Persons to
excel; for I perceived, that the People were moftly in Grey or White;
Some, a little Ruffct, others inclining to Green. Few among them,
except aged People, had long Gowns or Garments. Horatius's Coat
of Armour thewed Colden; the Straps under it, and on the Arms,
were elegancly embroidered on a fillemot Ground; his Mantle was
yellowith Whire, with Violet Reffexion. The Scabbard of his Sword
was dark Blue, finely wrought; the Hill reprefented an Eagles
Head: His Buskins, tied with white Strings, but quite fouled,
as I judged, by Sand and Duft, were Purple. His Sifters Upper-gar-
ment was light Blue; her Breaft-garment light Vellow, with violet
Reffexion, almofl like that of her Brother. The aged Woman be-
neath her was twarthy-skinn’d; her Garment greenith Blue, and
plain. The Lioneffes were dark Porphiry, and the Pyramid, of a rocky
Stone.
Having fufficiently viewed this Picture, and exactly learnt all the
Circumftances of it, I took infinite Delight in feeing how naturally the
Occurrence was exprefted, and that nothing was fuperfluoully introdu-
ced, tho' the Story does not make meation of all the Perfons who
were brought into this Reprefentation. I thought, it is truly of great
Moment, that the principal Parts of a Story be well expreffed; and
herein, a good Mafter has Work enough to give each Perfon his due
Paffion, to the end the Matter may lpeak for ittelf: But it becomes
kill more excellent by the Addition of all other necelfury Circum-
Rances (tho' not to be found in the Hifforian) after fuch a Manner
that both appear natural.
On the right side of this Piece, I faw a carved Batsrelief in whice
Marble, exhibiring an Emblem over the foregoing. I his Bassrelief
appeared in a Niche running towards the Point of Sight. On some
high Steps, ROM A was on her right Knee, and lifted up by Valour.
Her Breaft was fronting, and her Head turned a little backwards to
ards the lefe Shoulder; her right rm hung down, juft touching

wards the left Side, in the Hand whereof the held an hanging Flap-
per of her Garment. The left Foor, far from the Sceps, retted on
the Toes, feeming, by the Rife of the Hip, and the Knee keeping
down againtl the Steps, to puth her up. Paloar was reprefented turning
iis Upoer-parts fidewife towards ROMA, supporting her Elbow with its

was decked as an Heroine, with an Helmer, in the Form of a Town
wall, on her Head, and laid with the left Hand a Staff down on the

Goddes of Fure was dreff like an old Marron; in her Girdle Ruck 2
Pair of Scifiors; her Under-parts were feen fidewife, and the Upper
from behind, with her Eves Lxed on ROMA. Under the aforelaid
Trophies, the horned Tiber-got lay with his left Arm relling on a
large Vafe, and holdng in his right Hand an Oar behind his right
Side He lay on his left side, with the Breatt turned againtt the Light;
the left Les was ttreicked our, yer faintly rifing; the right tlip up
wards, and the Thigh, feen only to the Knee, refied on the other leg;
the Relidue unred with the Ground. Behind his Back, the She-wolf
and Part of the two Children were feen. Above him appeared some
Columns, as of a Porrico, running touards the Point of Sight, which,
2s on the other side, were half lod in the Ground. terfory, fying
between RMid and Tylam, held, in her right Hand, a Crown of
Laurel over the Head of the former, and with the left putting into
her Hand a Scepter topped with a little Globe; her Garment was
frng behind her, and her Legs, quice extended without any fore
Thortening, faincly united with the Ground. In the Shield of Putur
was repretenred the Combat of Horatius with the Curatis, and on bet
Helmer, crowned with Cas-leaves, was a Lion's Head, and the fim
on her Buskins. This Work was incloled between two young lain
trees, not much leaved.

The Triumph, on account of the mournful Accident,
to much af
felted me, that I remained in Sufpence; not knowing,
for fear of a
miferable Iffue, whether I might turn to the following
Piece: Never-
thelels, confidering the Bravery of Horatins's Explot,
whereon de-
pended the Power of Rome, I took heart, in hopes of
his Preferva-
tion, which I found agreeable to the Writer's Relation.
Horatins then was secured for the Murther of his Sifter, and, ac
cording to Law, fentenced to be pur to Death: Ver, in Confideration
of his heroic Action, pardoned, on Condition that his Father paid, as
a Fine, a certain Sum of Money into the publick Treafury. The
Pilture, as I remember, was thus:
Secend Piffure.
At the Cupitol, Tufice, or the Reman Law, fat in a raifed Chair,
with the Scales in her lefr, and a Poleax in her right Hand. In one
Scale lay a Sword, and in the other, a Crown of Laurel with a Palm-
branch; this lacter far over-ballancing the other Scale, as a Token
that the Law is mitigaced by Mercy. The Criminal food very de-
jected before her, with his Hands iron’d behind him. On her left
Side, the Father, on his Knees, was offering a Veffel of Money at
her Feer: On her right flood Afercy, with-holding the Hand wherein
was the Pole-ax, and with the other pointing at a Picture, held by
some Children, reprefenting the decayed Roman Dominion reffored by
the Valour of Horatius. Further were feen the Arms of the three
Rain Brethren, planred there by himself round the Starue of ROMA,
whereon Tuflice had lixed her Eyes. Another Child, crowned with
Laurel, was loofing the Fetters of the Aecuted with one Hand, and
putting on his Helmet, or feeting up the Cap of Liberty, with the
other. On each side of the Throne was a Bassrelict, and over
them two Niches: in that on the right side was reprefented Numa
Pompilins, and in that on the left Lycurgus, two of the moff anci-
ent Legiflators. The Bals-relef under Nums exhibited the Example
of Charenhss, who, to enforce his Law, Rabbed himself, in full Se-
nate, for having acted contrary to it: And under Lycurgas, that of
Setencs, when, for his Sons Sake, who, by Law, had forfeired his
Eyes, he caufed one of his own to be put out. So firict were the an=
crent Romans in Support of their Laws. Over the Throne hung two
Tables, containing the Reman Laws, written in Greef Letters of Gold.

This unexpected Erent much rejoiced me; wherefore, full of De.
fire, I went to a third Picture, in order to observe on what Bafis fo
great a Work was built, and found it as follows.
Jullas Hefilias, cholen by the Reman People for their third King;
on account of his great Ability and Merit, invaded the Alban Teri
fory, tho' a four People, and bearing much Sway in Iraty. Thefe,
weakened by many Battles, at laft agreed with the Romans to end
the Dispuce by a Combat between three Brothers on each side; thofe
of the Remans were named Heratir, and of the Albans, Curatir.
The Fight was glorious, yet doubtful, but at laft fortunate for
the Ronins; for, one of the Horatis, after having loft his two Bro-
thers, miftrulting his Strength againt three fuch brave Enemies, add
ed Policy to his Courage, and, by an artful Sleight, flew the three
Caraiii one after another; and thus got the Viltory.
Third Pitture.
Here appeared the Place of Combat, fenced in. On the right Side
was feen the General of the Roman Forces, and on the other, at 2
Diflance, he of the Albans, both firting fomewhat high, with their
Badges of Dillindion. In the middle of the Piece, Horatins was re-
pretented turning Tail to the latt of the Curatis; but returning, he
run his Puriuer thro' the Breaft; whereupon, he fell backwards. The
second, a little from thence, was on his Knees, with his Face to the
Ground, and all bloody, bearing up a little on his Elbow: He lay,
about the middle of the Fence, againtt a Poft, whereon ftood the Fi-
gure of Fate, or Fortune in Copper. Jult beyond this Poft, lay the
third Rreiched our on his Back: And at the End of the Paling were
feen the two dead Horatis. Over the valiant Heroe, Viftory shewed
herfelf, with the left Hand crowning him with Laurel, and, with the
right, holding our a Cap and Staff to the Chief of the Romans; who
thereupon joyfully came down from his Seat, with the Acclamations
and Clappines of the People. Oppofite, ffood the Chief of the con
trary Party affonithed, and turning his Back, in order to go awaj.
The People withdrew in Tumule at the Sound of the Roman Trum-
pets; leaving their Field-badges in the Place. On the right Side, be
hind the Romans, appeared Part of the Town wall, and on the o
ther, behind the Albans up to the Wall, the Field full of Tents on
a low Ground. Over the Reman Arbiter, or Umpire, was feen Ro-
matss and Remus cut in a large Stone. The Field-badge of the 41.

hars was a Dragon or Harpy. In the Offskip appeared the Tiber, and
the Alps always covered with Snow.
Thus was the Plan of this artful Piece, which I thought no lets wor
derful than the others, in Force and Dispofition as well as Naturalnels.
Every Thing was exactly obferved; the Paffions and Motions to well
expreffed, the Place to plainly apparent, the Quality of the By-works
to proper, and the Lights, Shades, Colours, Coc. to advantageoutly di=
sribured, that I could fcarce believe it a Picture. I could not but ad-
mire the three remarkable Divissons of this Story: As firft, the Begin-
ning, bappening without the Town; fecondly, The Sequel, seen within the
Town; and lanly, The End of the Scory, or, what was tranfulted in
the Capitot; without any Thing of Moment intervening, from whence
2. Painter could make a Picture: 1 speak, with respect to the different
Matter, which opportunely offers to the Thoughts and Execution of 2
judicious Mafter.
As the Sente of the Story is very particular, to the three Pictures
were as excellent from firft to laft. In the firff, we perceive the lucky
Chance of Arms; or, the Valour of the Heroe, whereby he gained
the Repure of a Deliverer of his Country: in the Second, we confider
him as a Murtherer; or, the Accident as a bloody Triumpb, and him
elaced with his succets: And, in the Third, we fee him as a Aalefactor,
condemned to be put to Death; or, as one who had tranfgreffed the
Laws. Truly, thole three Events may ferve for intiructive Examples
to all Men. Do we not fee in them the common Courfe of the World.
and that too great Success and Prosperity make many Men proud and
infolent? And what do not their blind Pallions lead them ro! Certain-
ly, Unthankfulness to Heaven is the Prelude to many Difatters and
Errors, leading them into the greatelt Dangers However, all Things
are governed by Providence.
The Middle of the Cieling had a large Oval Piece, wherein Provis.
dence was, in the greateff Depth, repretenced fitting on a Globe, dreit
in Gold Stuff, with her Head crowned, and about it twelve glictering
Stars; having in her right Hand a Scepire, with an Eye on Top; on
her Breaft, a sun; and on her Knee holding a Lookingglats with her
left Hand; her Look was full of Majefty and Authorny: She pointed
downwards at Roma, who fat a little to the left side, on a Cloud, ar-
tended by. Religion, Valear, and Concerd. Long Life, Health, and
Prosperity, came gently waving down towards her. Long Life, was a.
beautiful Virgin in her Prime, with a Flame of Fire on her Head,
and a Serpent, with the Tail in its Mouth, in her fland. Health, was

riry appeared as a naked Vouth, crowned with Laurel, with a Cor.
na Cogra, full of Fruit, under his Arm. Retigion, or Piety, was dreff

fes, with his Club and Lion’s Skin. Concerd looked fomewhat more
compoted than Piety; having in her Arms, a Bundle of Rods, which
a Cuordned with a red Ribbon. ROMIA, dreft in Whice, or light
Blne, under a purple Robe embroidered with old, held in her right
Hand, a Pike, and in the left, a Laurel-branch; on her Head the
had an Helmet, and Buskins on her Legs.
Now, we ought to weigh the Meanings of thefe Things. Provi.
dine is to be contidered as the chief Ruler of worldly Affairs; de.
baling and railing Empires as the pleafes. The three Cifes of long
Life, Health and Profferity are Bleftings flowing from her. The cor-
poreal Virtues are the Effects of Might, whence they proceed: The
firtt is Religion; the second, Valour; and the third, Concord; thefe
eftablithed ROMd in her Power, and increated it. In relation to Art,
let us obterve, with what ingenuity and Oncommonness the Maffer has
executed thote Pictures: I fav, Oncommonness; fince I never faw them
handied by any other after such a Manner. Firft, Previdence is in the
greatell Depth; and, according to Guets, thrice as big as the Lifs.
The three bifts, which the iends down, being fomewhat lower, are
not batf to brg; and the undermolt, to wit, ROMA, and the Charac
ters accompanying her, are still smaller, yet fomewhat larger than the
Lite.
Providence has no Bounds, always maintaining her uncontrolled
Power, without Dimmution; and tho' the three Gifes, which fow
from her, are but small Purts, yer, with respect to the undermoll
Figures, they are much bigger; and keep among them their own Forms,
as reigning over them. The three others, on the undermoft Clouds, being
but corporeal Virues, are therefore much smaller than the preceding,
and appear with less Majelty: Neverthelefs ROMA excels, and seas
Berself bigger; intimating thereby her Growth and Improvement
Her firting on Clouds implies, in my Opinion, her rifing above all o
ther Powers of the World
This would be a montirous Delign, if Art, with respect to Per.
pettire, were nor duely obferved: But, by this means, the Piece look
ed to perfell, that I judged it could not otherwife be good; for the

undermoll Croup, as quite low, was very flrong; the middlemolt,
according to its Diftance, fomewhat fainter; and the uppermofl, very
faint, and almofl imperceptible.
This Emblem bears a myfterious Interpretation, and may, in gene-
ral, be applied to all the Governments in the World, provided the Fi-
gure of ROMA be atter’d, and another fubffiruted, as Things require.
inftead of Esculapius we may reprefent Health, by the Figure of 2
Woman, and in the Place of Hercules, the fame; taking for Valour an
Heroine, holding an Oaken Branch in her right Hand, with a Lyon
on her Shield.
In treating formerly of this Sort of Tables, we have called them
Emblematicas, carrying a myftic Senfe, whether they be mundane or
(piritual: However, as a Diftinction between both, and to thew that
this is mundane and hifforical, we muff obferve, that it is not in-
termixed with any emblematic Figures, which have a fpiritual Sente,
except thole of Esculapins and Hercules, which therefore in this
Work I reject as untit, and only proper for poetic and fabulous Sub-
jells: As if, inflead of ROMA, were introduced Trejs or Egine,
which are Dominions no where now fublifling but in the poetic Wri-
tings; we find that this Emblem, like its Subject, is not only
mundane and heathenith, as the Story of Horatins proves, but that
therein is alfo expreft the Force or myfterious Senfe by thofe heathen-
ith Figures.
Now, if it be asked, why this Cieling-piece does not allude to the
Perfon of Heratins, as that in the tenth Chapter to Hercules: My
Opinion is, that the Conclulion of the Story, to far as it respects him,
is contained in the second Picture: For here we cannot expect any De-
ification, nor do the Gods interfere in the Marter: They regard only
thole who are reckoned in their Number, fuch as TEneds, Hercules,
Memnon, and others of godly Racc.

C H AP. KIII. The Fable of Califio, adapted to the Corinthian
Order, in the Upper-fory.
A M delighted to relate here, in four Pieces, the wonderfully em-
bellished Story of Califfe, and her Deitication; as not unworthy,
in my Judgment, to adorn to fine an Apartment as this laft, which
was of the Corinthian Order, and very magnificent, as well with re-

spelt to the extraordinary Thoughts as their artful Tun; the Concly.
fion whereof renders this Work moft perfect.

The arit Piece was as follows.
Coll2o, cired with hunring, went to repote in the Shade of the
Trees; Tupiter enamour’d with her, came to delude her in the Shape
of Dirrs, and gracined his Paftion, notwithflanding all her Efforts to
+
the contiary.
There, on the right Side of the Piece, on an Eminence, the inno.
cent Creature was luting under the Trees, not at reft, but full of Con.
cern, Shame, and Dread, melred into Tears, with her Hand on the
Edge of a Fountan; her Treties, half looted, hung carelctly over her
naked Shoulders; her chalt Borom was above half bare, and her Legs
ancover’d to Encemlineis, fufficiently thewed her forrowful Facc. 74-
pirer, the Aucher of it, was feen a little off, next the Middle of the
Piece, above the Horizon, not as a difguited or pretended Dinnd, but
the Chief of the Gods, thinng with Majefty, with his Diadem on his
Head, and in his purple Robe; not as a Thunderer, with Lighinings
and Tempeits, bur only actended by his Eagle. The cruel and dege
nerace Lover feemed to deride her Sorrow, having his left fland up at
his Breall, as if he meant, that he had got his Will; wherefore, pe-
netraring the Clouds, he advanced thro' the Air, fortaking the mife-
rable Homan. The unmerciful incendiary, Cupid, was excinguthing
his Torch in the Fountain, looking at Tupiter, who, with his pont-
ing Scepter, commanded him to do fo. Disns was teen in the Off
skip, in a Valler, with her Retnue of Numphs. The Landship was
delightful and woodr: Here and the easreard tome River gods. Be-
hind Caj-s, among the Trees, flood a lerm of Priagus in Shade. I
attentively viewed the aforelaid three Figures, and reflected to mylelf,
how well they acted their Parts; clearly openng the diatter, even to
the very Term, which, tho' it might be placed there accidentally,
yet contribured towards the Exprestion.
Secend Pictitie.
The unhappy Cal o, bemoaning her Misforcune, and full of Shame
and Fear, and difcarded by her Mistrets, was fecking Shelcer in Joh
tudes: Ver the jealous June elpyed and found her there.
On the left Side of the Piece, appeared the fuperior Goddets of
Heaven, glittering, coifed with Peacock's Feathers, inflead of a Da-
dem, of royal Head ornament, and feeming to turn about, as the was

stepping on a Cloud, in order to go upwards: She was dress’d in her
blue Garment, and held her Scepter in her right Hland, on the right
Hip, charging Hellib Rage, or Revenge, which attended and was at
her Beck, to punith the innocent Califfe; and lifting up her left Arm,
and the Fingers ffreight up, the, with a fevere and envious Look, re-
proached the oppretted Creature, with lying with her Confort. Re-
venge was bearng, with Serpents and Adders, belides her fmoking
Pitch-Torch, the miferable Califfe; who now had no more of her for-
mer Shape, except her Cloths, which fell a Prey to the hellith Fury:
There lay the Quiver, here the Bow, yonder the Girdle: As Icon-
ceived, it was a Sbe-Bear who thook off thofe Cloaths, and was taking
to Flight. Being now metamorphifed into to frightful a Montter, by
the immoveable Jealouty of June; the, in her Flight, looked up to
Heaven, feeming, by her Bellow, to move Tupster to Pity. This
Landship was allo a dark Wood, filled here and there with fleeping
Rivergods: Among the Trees appeard fome wild Bealts running
about, and a Lyon in a Bottom, on the right Side near a Rock, drink-
ing at a River: Upand down arofe some, alm and other Trees After
this Piece, another prefenced, the Subject whereof was this.
Areas, Son of the deluded and now metamorphifed Califfe, was
fifteen Years of Age, when, according to his Cultom, going a hunting,
he met with a frightful She bear, which came towards him, not to
hurt him, as he thought, but, if poffible, to make herfelf known to
him; yet he, ignorant that the was his Mother, ffourly prepard to
thoot her. Tupiter, from Heaven, feeing this, in Pity, hindred
the Matricide.
Third Pifture.
Here, on the right Side of the Piece, Areas appeard gent-
ly Repping forth from behind some Trees, and putting an Arrow
into his Bow, in order to thoot his Mother, unknown to him in that
Shape. But Afercury, Rying down fuddenly, withheld his Arm; at
whom he therefore looked back. The celiffial Meffenger flaring be-
hind at the She bear, which was on the second Ground, inrimating
with his Staff in his lefe Hand, that the scould take to Flight, which
the feemed to do; the ffood upright, with her Under-parts towards
him, and the upper turn’d to the Leff, fwaying towards the Road.
The Way the took was apparent, beginning from her Feet like
Dull, or thin Vapours, altering, by Degrees, into Clouds, which ran
winding about her, and at lall mixed with the Aiy,, wherein Tapiter

appeard, yer very faint, and almoff imperceptible. In the Clouds by
him, on his right Side, but fomewhat lower and more forward, fat
the three fatal Syfers; of whom Clothe was fpinning the Thread, La.
chesss winding it on the Reel, and Atropes ready to cur it; which Tupi-
fer obferving, laid his left Hand on the Sciffors, holding up his Scep-
ter in the other, with his Mouth a little open; the, furpriz’d at this,
turned towards him. Arcas food aftride, with his Breaft projeting.
Behind him, on and near a Stone, lay fome Game, as an Hind, Fox,
Hare, Cc. together with a Garment, which I judged to be his. Low
againt the fad Stone lav a Rivergod, with his Vafe. This Landship
was woodr, like the others. The She bear, about the middle of the

Picce, appeared in the Shade, againtt the light Offship. On the left
Side, on the second Ground, or at the Extremity of the firtl, was a
runed Tomb, with fome Cypreffes; and behind, on a further Ground,
arofe 2 large Rock.
Afier this, I was curious to view diligently the Cieling-piece, as
the Conclution of this artfal Work, and I found it thus.
Tugiter affected with the forrowful Fare of Catiffe, does, notwith-
Randing Tums Hlatred, glorify her with the radiant Brightness of the
Nortb-Star, which, among the Conftellations, is named the Great
Bear, and is followed by the Little Bear, into which her Son Areus
W2s transform’d
Fourth Pifture.
Underneath, in the Piece, the Touth was feen flying upwards, pur
fuing his Mother with Bow and Arrow, and fupported by fome Cy
pids: He appeared bickwards, without any forethortening, with his
right Arm, with the rrow, extended, and the other, with the
Bow behind; having a Quiver by his Side. Tupiter fomewhat 2
bove him on the right side, itting on a Cloud, and large-fized, was,
with an eret Scepire, thewing him the Lodiac, wherein a particular
bright Star appeared very glittering. The Bear was feen rifing a lit
tle beyond the faid Star, tooking back upwards, and being encom
paffed with a great thining Light, in the Shape of a Star, which er
lighrened the whole Piece; her Hind paws refted on the Clouds, which,
betide her, from Tupiter off to the left Side, rofe under her. Quite
on the left Side, lat Juno on the Rainbow, looking envioully at 4r-
cas; the leaned her Head on her left Hand, with the Elhow on the
Rainbow; and lay half carned to the right, her Under-parts inclin

ing towards treas, and the Upper from him; her right rm and
Scepter croffed her Body. At her Feet, on the Clouds, lay fome
Watergods and Goddelles, as Sub-directors of the Clouds and Dew.
Behind her ftood her Peacock, with its Tail to (pread as feemingly to
ferve for a Diadem. Iris appeared looking upwards behind her, with
an Handover her Eyes, to shade them from the Beams of the Star.
Diana and Apolle fat behind her. Tune and those firting beneath her
were shaded by the driving Clouds above. Diand, Apollo and o-
thers looked finiling. Tugiter appeared directly in the Light, of e
qual Height with the Bear. Tune was a little lower, and the River-
gods and Areas beneath her; he was a Vouth of fmall Size, receiving
his Light from the Star above.
Thus the Work concluded with the Deification of the unhappy Ca.
liffe, a second Time metamorphifed. It would be troublefome to re-
late all the Particulars of it, and needless to the Knowing: Where-
fore, I shall only fubjoin the general Difpolition of the Lights and
thaded Parts. Tupiter and Arcas were ftrongly lighted againtt the
Blue of the Sky on the right Side. Yune, contrarily, on the left Side,
where was the Star, was dark. The foremolt Water-god, under 74.
20, received a little Light from above, holding his Hand over his
Eyes.
Animadversion.
This Fable clearly thews, how beautiful Bodies are polluted by
Uncleannels; for in a thort Time after Califfe was delivered of her
Son Areas, Jane transformed her, as a Punishment of her Unchallity,
into a She-bear, a Beaft to deformed as to be reckoned among Mon-
fers. The aforelaid Rvil has fuch direful Effects, that the Fruit or
Children of nalawful Love mortally hare their guilty Parents; for
Beauty fained with Onchaffity, is of no Account in the Eyes of the
Virtuous, and what before created Wonder, is now a Mark of Infamy.
Ovid, in an elegant and artful Manner, alligas Califfe a notable Place
in the Northern Hemifphere, and thews Jano's intreating Tbetis, that
thofe Stars (according to the Belief of the Heathens) might never re-
freth themfelves in the Sea, in order to portray wonderfully her eter-
nal Shame, as furpaffing the other capital Stars, and having fuch a
Station near the Northern Pole, that, as this Pole or Point of the
Axis is Above our Horizoh, this Star, whatever Courfe it takes,

can never be out of our Sight; and therefore her Crime be as little
out of our Memories.
But a more Chriffian like Inference may be, that the pollured
Soul, abhorring her Crime, by true Repentance gained a moft glori.
ous and fhining Aspect, belides a fixed Station, in the Heavens;
fetting an Example to others like Mary Mlugdalen whofe Crimes, thro'
Repentance, were not only expiated, but, by an incorruptable Glory,
intirely blocted out.
The Truth of this Story, taking off the poetic Mask, is, that 4.
C1s, Son of Tupiter and the Nymph Califfe, taught the Arcudiions
(itt pretended to be the most ancient People of the Earth, nay, older
thin the Ateon, as Plstarch intimates in his 76th and gand Roman
TUEEIERs, bexting to be sprung from the Earth, and therefore made great

gus Rld taught them to make it their Feod, which before was only Herbs
and Reors) to till the Ground and fow Corn; which Knowledge he
learned of TrigtolcrAs, Son of CGeres; and afterwards, to make Bread
of it; allo how to weave woollen Cloths for covering their Bodies;
likewife nuring them to many Civilities: In Acknowledgment of
which Benefaction, and in Honour to him, they named their Country
Acalid, which before was called Pelafgia, as Paufanias, in his Acr
is, teilifies.
C H AP. XIV. Description of the inward View of the Temple of
Apollo.
E have before, in treating of Painter-like Beasty, defcribed the
Ourfide of this Temple; we shall now, according to Promile,
thew the Intide of ir, keeping our former Method of writing
as if we had really viewed it.
Stepping into the Portico, 1 faw, over the Door of the Entrance, a
carred Lyre; whence I inferred, that this Edifice was facred to Apot

Things, to artfully worked and of fuch rich Materials.

these were of beautiful, plain, white Marble. The Figure of Apolle
was paked, crowned with Laurel, and holding a Scepter in its
Hand.
The Floor was inlaid with Variety of coftly Stones, in the Form
of a terreffrial CGlobe, in the Center whereof ftood the aforelaid Figure.
The Arch-work was Azure Bluc, bur I could not certainly perceive it
to be Mofaick; it was adorned with the Seven Plancts, and other Con-
Rellations, all in Gold. Near the Windows, between the two Pila-
fters, were Niches filled with Figures, each reprefenting one of the
Monibs of the Vear; they had the Form of young Men, and were
cut in whire fieth-colour’d Marble.
The whole Building confified alfo of Marble, but not to fine as that
of the Figures; for here and there,. under the Niches, in the
Mouldings, and about the Windows, it was veiny. In a Bafement,
running round the Temple, was carv’d a continued Bass-relief; the
Figures of it were about four Feet high, and of fine white Stone. The
other lafide -divition was the same as we have already described it
to be withour the undermoft Part being compoled of the lonie Order,
the middlemoft, of the Roman, and the apper, of the Corinibian.
Over the firff Cornices appeared Terms, inftead of Pilafters; thefe
reprefented the Hours, and with their Hleads tupported the Cupola;
they were in the Shape of young Virgins, to the Number of twenty
four: It would be redious to defiribe them, and their Badges of Di-
Hinction fingly; and the rather, fince Cafar Rips has to hindlomely
done it.
Next, I took notice of the orderly Difpolition and Proportion,
which was judicioully obferved throughout the Building; for Apetios
Figure was, as I gueffed, eight Feet high; and thofe about hm teven
Fectand an half; the young Men, reprefenting the Montbs, were leven
Fect; and the Terms for the fears, fix or fix and a half. This Pro-

C H A P. I. Of Cieling-painting in general.
2 MONG all the Parts of Painting none is to difficult
as that of ornamenting Cielings, tho' many think it eafy
even more eafy than an upright Piece on a Wall or over
s a Chimney: This is owing to ignorance, and an indiffe.
rence in People what their Cielings are dawb’d with, to
as they be but quickly finithed, dazzle the Eye and cort
little. Formerly they were contented with Foliage flightly painted
for faving Expence, and that in Places of Confequence only; whereas
ow, according to the prefent State of the Painters and Times, they
can have other Things for the fame Price, and the Painter making no
great Matter of it, they lay hold of the Opportunicy, cauting the
whole Cieling to be filled with Hiltories and Emblems, whether they
be fuitable or not.
We fee, that all Things from fmall Beginnings improve, and at
laft come to Perfection, thro' the indullry of judicious Arrifts: Even

plainly demonttrared. Wherefore, we need not wander, that to few
Painters excel in this Branch of the Art, fince they are little con
verlant with the practical Part of Perspective, tho' without it tis im
pottible to execute a good Cieling piece. Its certain, that many

Painters are rath enough to undertake fuch a Piece of Work, and
fometimes they happen to perform good Things, (for Labonoulnels
and daily Praltice often contribute much) neverthelgss, they do not
inquire, whether their Methods be the thorteff or longell, commonly
chuting that which firft offers, drudging without Certainty, and led by
meer Chance.




CHAP. II. Of the usual Difficulties in Cieling-painting.
IR ST, we are at a great fland, becaute we cannot ule the Life,
either in the Nudities or flying Draperies, tho' they be the prin-
cipal Objects.
Secondly, Becaule we cannot, without great Trouble, find the true
and certain Places of the Figures we introduce; for which Reafon,
they mult moftly be done by quess.
Thirdly, Becaute we cannot duely view the Work as long as tis on
the Eafel. Whence,
Lattly, le follows, that the Malter is always in pain for the Effect
of the Painting in being fixed in its Place.
Thefe Difficulties are not a little vexatious, even to one who un-
derflands his Buliness; for tis otherwife with thofe who make more
ule of their Hands than Heads, that is, who work without Founds-
tion, tho' thefe ought to be more careful than others Paint as many
Cielings as you pleafe, as long as you do not believe, that there
are Grounds and Rules for it, and remain in this ignorance, you will
never furmount the aforefaid Difficulries. The most skilful Mafter is
often at a lots in this Part of Painting. Let us then, in the first Place,
learn Perspective, and what it fhews us; fince thereby only we may
arrive at this laudable Study, which otherwife is impoffible.

CH AP. III. Of foreshertening Objects in Cielings.
T is obvious, that the Offskip, in a common Picture, is the Part
which retires or goes off from us, leffens and grows faint, and
that the Horizon is an utmoff Dillance limiting our Sight.

Pryile, and have boch his Skoulders of equal Height, and you will
14a perceive that the Shoulders, from one to the other, keep their
f4l Brealte, and ther Figue us full Thickness from Top to Toe.
Thus we fee evidende that there is no other Forghortening than in
r
te Leagie; or, to tay bever, in the Height; and the more the Fi-
stres, or other Osets, rise and appreach the Point of Sight, the sporter

and ire miagin they become; because, in their Breadth, they retain

har MerE: CarL Pregortion, as before has been faid. This is a prin-

cipal Rule, and ought alwars to be oblerved
1T

As for Bx. e27s, A. Batts gives full Precepis touching them, in the
latter Part of his Book of Perppertive yer I have Room to fay, that
when we would place Columns over Columns, for Galleries, we ought
to draw a rifing Line thro' their Centers, from the Bafis or Ground, to
the Point of Sight, even thro' each Balliffer, and thus find the due
Proportion of their Heights, as well as Breadths, by the Help of a
Gradation-line.
This, with respert to Proportion, mult likewife be obferved, in de-

Agrrg Figures, and other Objects, as I shall hereafter thew, by Ex-
amples.
This Sort of Painting is not only the moff artful, but allo the moft
difficult, as I have before faid; becaute, alcho' we underfland the Rules
and Practice of it, it appears, nevertheless, difagreeable and deformed;
which no one can be a Judge of but the Mafter himfelf, unless it be
put up in its proper Place, and feen at the due Dillance.

C H A P. IV. Of the sizes of CGieling-figures.

HE Figures, which we paint in Cielings, ought not to exceed the
common Size of a Man, to wit, fix Feet and an half, when they
are to low, as to be even with the Cieling; but, being higher and
fitting on Clouds, or flying, they mult leffen and go of, as Perspective
teaches. Vet, we may reprefent the Desties as big as we please, pro-
vided they be not painted with more Strength than other Figures: It
even fometimes happens, that when they almoff vanith our of Sight,
they have yet human Bignels.
Sunsbine is the moft proper and agreeable in Spiritual Reprefen-
tations.
As for the Glory of each Deity in particular, they keep it when they
appear to Aen, but when they are reprefented in Heaven, tis a Miix-
ture of many fmaller, producing one great Seining: To do this artful-
ly, is not a Matter of the lealt Contequence; and he is a great Ma-
Her, who, intlead of dark, thick, and beary Clouds, like Woot-fucks,
places his Figures on thin, transparent, and almoft infensible Papours.
It will not be improper, in this Chapter, to mention fomething
touching flying Figures in the Air.
Tho' the Air be fellom without a Wind, and this may always be
tomewhat perceived, it is neverthelels not advifable to make it ap-
fear in Cielings; becaute, if the Wind were flirring, the Figures
fying before it would teem to be motionless and contrarily, thofe
which are fitting or flanding, thew as mch Vielencs as the fying ones:
For this, Reafgn, no Wind mult come into the Piece, but what the
tippiting of Each Figure caules, that we may plainly fee by what
Motion the Draperies are Clung, as allo the Places the Figures are go
ing to, or returning from, one gently waving, and the other nimble
and iwift.
The different Stafs are very proper to this on fuch Occations, and
they very much conduce to exprets the Marter; as the Refferion of ruf-
King Silk for waving Figures, and which are gently defcending; thin
and seazy Silk, for forft and deen-ftying Figares, and the moft plant
or thick Silk or Stuf, for fitting, lying, or flanding ones. The Secret

and Importance of a fine and firring Cieling-piece lies chieffy
herein.
As for the making of the coloured Stufts of flying Figures, becaute
ther cannor be pur on the Layman, and therefore not painted after
the Life, we cannot lay down any Rules about them: Nothing but a
good Conception and natural Judgment, joined to continual Pratice

and Oble. vazon, can bring the Artiff to perform it. We mult ufe
ther Means, and be perfect in them; obferving what Stuff is moff
proper to the Occation, as we have before intimated.
We ought alio to take care, that the thin Stuffs be rearm and trans.

Iving or flying, unleis, in the Cale of People fuppoted to be on Cie
lings or Galleries, who then are either flanding, fooping or kneeling,
as the Subject requires.
Ler me lar, that we ought fometimes to make fome Additions to
the Diupontion of the general and particular Objects; but with as
much Caution as pottible, that the lnabiliry of the Artiff, and the
Deficiencr of the lfork may not appear.

C H A P. V. Rieihed for vicwing a Cieling-piece on the Easel, as if
on the Cieling.
 E have already obferved the Difficulties arifing in Cielings, with
I refped to the Cie of the Life, and in laying down Rules fib
terrient to it. Now, had 1 my Sight, I should certainly find
out fome; but fince this is impracticable wichour figural Demontlrat
on, and I cannor pottibly verbally do it, I shall nevertheless thew some
Methods, which, tho' they may feem triffing, have always been of
Service to me, and of lttle Trouble in their Ule.
After skerching my Ordonnance on Paper, I fixed it againtt a loy
Cieling; then taking a Looking-glats, and fitting under it, I with cal
exactly contidered every Thing, oblerving what was wanting in it; and
this I marked and corrected the Faules as much as poffibly I could
Next, I drew each Figure, whether naked or cloathed, after the Lit,
in tuch Manner as thall hereafter be thewn. Then I dead colour’d mr
Piece with luch a Light as I thought proper. After this I took the

Looking-glats again, and held it over my Head, in order to view com-
modiouly the Piece flanding behind me, inclining a little backwards
on the Eafel, as if if were againtt the Cieling; and cafting my Eyes eve-
1y where, firft on the general Defign, and then on the particular Parts:
This Examin I repeared, till by feveral Corrections I found, that I had
brought the Piece to my fancy. Here, be mindful not to take too
near, a Distance, to the end the Class may take in the whole Piece; for
which Reafon, I fometimes got with the Looking-glats on a Chair or
Table, and having my Pallet and Pencils in readinels, and brought my
Piece into fuch forwardness, I finithed it without further looking back.
I will now, for the Service of thofe who may find it uleful and ne-
cellary, allo treat,

CH AT. VI. Of Defgsing after the Life, for the Use of Cieling-
Paintings.
f E muft not ffatter ourfelves, that Cieling-painting can be per-
 formed without good Knowledge in Proportion, fince, as has
been faid, we cannot conveniently make ufe of the Life; for, how
great foever your Skill may be, you will fird Difficulty enough, tho'
the Life were before you, to bring it on the Cloth. Neverthelets, to
thew that it may be done, and that I have often uted the Life, I shall,
for the Service of thofe who are not spiring of Pains, by down my
Manner of doing it.
AfferI had fet the Model, whether of Man or Weman, on an high
Place, according to my Skerch, I far down on the Floor, with my
Bick againft the Steffeld, with a Lookingglats between my Legs,
which I mored and turned about to long, till the Model appeared in
it in fuch a Manner as I wanted according to my Point of Sight; and
then defigning it on Drawing-paper as correct as poftible, I painted af-
for this Defign without any Trouble.
As for the Diefes, I managed them in the fame Manner, calling
the Garment on the Layman according to my Sketch; I mean, eiit-
out Kring, which is a Thing impollible, and depends only on lmagi-
nation. I placed then the Layman, thus dress’d, on an high Treffel,
and fat down againtt it in the Manner aforefaid, and made a Defign of
the Dress; if it was a flying or lying Figure, I made thift with Pack-
thread, Wires, or fuch like Means, as well as I could; (paring for no
Trouble,

Trouble, when the Matter was important, and I had a mind to de
fomething fine.
I ufed the time Method in Defigaing after all forts of Plaiffers, as
Fices, Vafes, Urns, Ornaments, Cipitals, Feffoons of Flowers, (8d
in order to have them from underncath. Thas I maftered the greatett
Difficulties occurring in this Study: However, I did not this, before
my Cloth was in readinets for it, that I might not miftake; fince, nor.
Withitanding all our Care in some Things, elpecially spright standing Of-
jetts, we may eafily be deceived.
As to the Preparation of the Cloths for our Defign, as likewife the
Dead colcuring, in order to finith, and thereby to refreth our Memeries,
I shall row treat of them.
Firft, 1 fix the Point of Sight, either within or without the Piece,
as my Place of flanding direts: Then I ftrike, with a chalk’d Thread,
from the faid Point, as many Lines over my Piece as 1 find neceffary
to ferve all my upright flanding Objects, viz. Ballufters, Columns, Pil.
latters, Figures, Sr. which I fuppofe to be perpendicular: 1 alfo frike
some Disgonals, of Slope-lines, from that Side of the Piece whence the
Light comes, either left or right, parallel and equidiflant from each
other: Thele put me in mind how high or low the Light falls on my
Objects; if they run parallel with the Bafe, the Objects are lighted in
firely from the Side; if oblique or floping, as before is faid, they light-
en a litle fronting; and if they fall from on high, from the Point of
Sight, the Light comes diredly fronting, as is vifible in the Examples,
Numb. 1, 2, j, in Plate LXII.
I think myself obliged here to propofe to the Artiff a fmall Prac
tice of my own Inveation, and, in my Opinion, of little Trouble, but
great Advantage to Cieling- painters; fince we find, that, altho' there
are certain Rules, yer they cannot be put in ule without the greatelf
Trouble, Application, and Loss of Time, unless aided by some Prac
tice or other, or by fome artful Intrument; like Affronemy, which,
how demonftrative foever, has its Globe and Aftrolabe; Archiretture,
iis Plan and Level; Geometry, the Oval, Triangle, Square and Com
paffes; Mathemsties, Algebra, Cc. But, to return to my Inven
tion
I firft mould some WVax-puppers, as we have fhewn in the 6th Chap
ter of Ordennence, as big and as many as I think proper: Next1 take
as many pointed Wires, some long, others thort, whereon to flick the
Puppers, and keep them from bending, whether they be made fland
ing, lying, flying or ficting: This being done, Itake an oblong wood
Ch

an Trough, lined with Tin, of what Bigness I think proper, and 7
or 4 Fingers deep, for the placing as many Puppets as 1 pleafe. In
to the Corners1 put fome Pins or Screws to fatten a Cover of Wood
or Tin fitting the Trough, and made full of little Holes, wherein to
Rick the aforefaid wired Puppers; and fo as they may tun eality:
Then, I fill the Trough with Clay, or Kneaded Bran; and thus my
Machine is in readinels. Now, when I make ufe of it, 1 flick my
Puppets, bent and turned, according to my Delign, on the Wires, and
thro' the Holes, into the Clay, where I would have them, one high,
another low, one flooping forwards, another leaning back, Coc. as
the Subject requires; which will then sland immoveable.
My Scheme being in this Forwardness, 1 lean the whole Machine
back on a Tables be the Light left or right, and then flightly defign
the Figures in the Manner I have thewed with the Lines. I can give
the Machine fuch a Light as 1 defire, either from a side, froncing, or
from on high, a Common, Sun-hine, or Candle-light.
Now, for perfecting this Sketch, and conveniently painting afcer
it, I fet my Layman, with fuch a Dress as each Figure requires, in
the Manner before laid down: And then, my Cloth being ready, I
proceed to painting.
I invented this Machine in the Vear 1668, and put it in ufe for a-
bout s Years, with great Advantage, and wich fuch exact Refleltion,
that I afterwards had no further Occation for it, tho' I never ufed more
than 3 or at moft 4 Puppets.
Now, the curious Artill mult alfo know what Obfervations I made
in the Ufe of the Machine.
Firfl, as Plate L XIII. fhews, I put one Puppet coming direfity down,
quite extended, namely, with Head and Feet both on a Line, and then
oblerved, that there was not the leaft Foreshortening, all the Partshav-
ing their full Lengths.
A second Puppet 1 fet apright, fanding in Profile on one Side of
the Point of Sight, and found it foresportened in all its Parts.
 Third I ler fying upwards from behind forwards, and perceived,
that the Members foreportened fomewbat more than these of the first,
and somewhat less than those of the second.
A Fourth I placed fitting with its Upper-parts upright, the Thigbs
parallel, and the Legs like the Upper-parts; and obferved, that when it
was quite in Profile, the Upper-parts and Legs foreshortened, and the
Thigh kept its full Lengtk, as it alfo did when in a Frent-posstion..

Having made a firm imprestion of thefe Things in my Thoughts,
I had no further Occafion for that Method.
We shall now tay fomething,
C H A P. Vil. Of the Colouring of fying Figures.
ER EIN we mull obferve, that in Cieling-painting tis the
tame as in Landskips. Firfl, we rub in the greateft Light of

the Sky, then all Parts about it; next, the higheff and moff
faint Objects, and then the lower and more near ones; and, in cale a
Balluftrade be reprefented, it muft be the laft: The Reafon of this
I have thewn in treating of the Deadcolouring of Hifferies and Land
SKifs.
Moreover, as in a fine Landskip the Sky principally governs all
Things, and without it no proper Diftance can be given to the Pic
ture, to is the fame in a Cieling-piece with Figures fying thro' the
Air; for is impostible to make Objects rife, unlets they have some
Communication with the Air. Nor is it enough for Objects, going
off higher or further from us, to be painted fainter and faimter, as in
2 Drawing or Print, but the Colour mult alfo be thewn; and as the
Air is coloured, to muft the Objects partake of it; I mean, in their
Stides; for if the fir be blue, yellow, or red, the Sbades ought like
wile to have a Mixture of Blae, Tellow or Red
As to the Light of the Objects, we mult obferve, that of what
Colour foever it be, it breaks and grows darker as it goes off: Even,
were the Air, as I may fay, Snow-white, it breaks by Diftance or
Air interpoting; the Red becomes Violet; the Vellow, greenith; and
the Violet, Bluc. As the Objects go off from us, and approach the
Air, they are darkened, White becomes darker, pale aellow the
fame; and to on, in other Colours.
Something fill remains to be remarked, with respect to Objects in
the Air, viz that fince the Air communicates Light from all Parts,
the broad Shades cannot poffibly be to dark as in a Landskip, or other
Piece; but contrarily, the dark Touches will be to much the fronger:
All that is in Shade ought to be lighter, and feen more plain, yet
fomewhat less than in the Light. 1t muft be likewife known, that
round Objects have no Surface, especially on the shaded Side, that is to
fay, the Our line againft the Sky ought to unite and vanith, not quite

frumbled away, but made fomewhat lighter on the Edge; as we
have clearly demonfirated by the Example of a globular Body,
Book l. Chap. 6. implying, that fuch Works in the Air differ from
others, to wit, that the Objerts againff the Sky are mere reanding and
going of.


C H A P. Vill. General Observations in painting the Cielings of
Halls, Galleries, &cc.
+r H E firff and principal Obfervation on thefe Occafions is, that
the Quality and Regulariry of the Architefture be firmly prefer-
ved in all its Parts.
The second Obfervation concerns the Grandear of the Architecture,
as being the main Matter. Painting, in this Cafe, is only to be con-
fidered as an Aid, to accomplith it with lets Charges; wherefore, fuch
Care mult be taken, that the Painter's Deligns do not marr thofe of
the Architelt, but that both unite in fuch a Wianner as to induce the
Eye to take every thing for Truth irfelf.
By the firff Obfervation, that the rchitelture ought to preferve its
Regularity, we give to underfland, that the Structure of the Room
muft chieffy be regarded by the Painter, in his Cieling pieces, to as
not to be hurt by making Openings where they ought not to be; for its
not allowable to make them every where, as big or litle as we pleafe:
The Cieling must remain Cieling. ll that is withour the Painting, as
the Summers, ought to have their proper Thickneffes, and be latting,
and not feem as tumbling, which yet, thro' Heedleffnels, fometimes
is the Cafe: For Inftance, let us fuppose the Cieling to be divided in-
to three Pannels lined with Cloth; one next to the Windows, the fe
cond in the middle, over the Chimney, and the third to be next the
Wall; that in the middle is between two Summers, one Foot in, and
the two Side ones hie almoff ffuth with the Under parts of thofe Sum
mers: Now, if the two Side-cloths be, like the middle one, adorned
with Sky, and the Thicknels of the Summer (which is one Foor) not
painted on the Cloth, the Cieling, on thofe Sides, is to much weak-
ened, or at lealt seems to be so, and is beavier in the middle, contrary to
Architelture: Whereas, to make it look natural, and according to Or-
der, the Ponderolity muft, in this Cale, be on the sides, and the
middle Part lighteff; that it may not feem to be falling on our Heads.

Moreover, we ought to observe; that there muftt be but one Open.
ing, and that in the middle; fince there is but one Point of Sight,
and but one Place of flanding to view the Work to Advantage.
As for painting the Thicknets of the Summer, 1 only faid it to
rectify a Miltake often committed, when a Cieling is made alt over
oxin, and intlead of a Covering, nothing is left but a Grate, which
cannot be juftitied; Some think,. if may pats for a Lantern, but
they are much mittaken; for a Lintern rifes, and a Cieling lies
far: Moreover the whole Cieling cannot ferve for a Lantern, becaute
of the Windows in front. The principal or middle Piece mult predo-
minare, and of contequence be open, and the others closed, I mean, not
to have any Sky of living Creatures, but Bass-reliefs, Foliage, Com-
parrments of Flowers, all of fuch a Colour as fuits with the Apart-
ment. This I judge to be the firtl and principal Care and Study of a
good Cieling-painter, before he fets about the Work; for in the Divi
2
ton of a Cieling it is as with a Diamond, the largelt and moft valua-
ble is fet in the middle, and round it, the less and less.
As to the second Obfervation, that the Art of Painting is aiding to


A-mecture, and enrickes it at less Expence, the Point is plain;
wherefore I thail proceed to thew the Reaton why the one may fpoil
the other.
In painting Divisions, it aften happens that the Summers have not
Proper Rets to he on; especially when the Cieling is covered all over
(and the Summers hid) with a fingle Cloth, and left to the Judgment
of an ignorant Painter, who then, without Confideration, divides it
into s, 4. 6, 8 or more Pannels, and thefe parted by painted Sum
mers which do not bear on any thing: Now, to prevent this, you
mull let each Summer reft on a Discharger, Pilafter of Cartouche, as
Architelture reaches For laftance, were you to divide the two Pan
nels next the Windows and Wall, each into two Parts, in order to
have four Pannels, this would be improper and againtt Archifecture;
becaute of the Flamels over the Window, unlels it were compals
headed, and then it would not do withour a Cartouche.
If it be asked, whether the Dirisson be a Painters Buliness! I fay,
Ic is, to far as he underflands Architecture; otherwife more proper
for an Archifect; at leaft may be eafily done with his Affillance.
As to the Work, where the Painting may diforder, or be contrary
to Archirecture, it lies in the Deligns, when they do not fuit the
Building, nor perfecily bear on Foundations, or have their proper
Weight By the Foundation of the Puinting 1 mean, the pariment;
and


Cielings, or Plafonds.

and, by the Weight of the Defign, that what the Painter intends to ex-
hibit in his Cieling-piece be not too heavy, and teem to press down the
Under-parts. The better to clear my Meaning, I will luppole a Room
to be 20 Feet (quare: Now, if a second Depth, or upper Room,
were to be reprefented, the Piers, Columns, Doors, and Windows
thereof muft needs accord with thofe of the under Room, and bear
upon them: And, in the next Place, the Courfe of the Orders ought
exactly to be obferved, as Architelture teaches, that is to fay, the
beavieft muft be undermeft; firft, the Tuscan, next, the Doric, then, the
Jonic, next, the Roman, and laftly, the Corinthian, and to upwards
lighter and lighter; which I think is feldom obferved; and the Rea-
fon is, becaute the Figures are fometimes reprefented bigger ihan the
Life; which neceffitates the Artiff to proportion his By-works accord
ingly: An unpardonable Error, and not at any Rate to be juttitied?
But I shall fay more of this on another Occation, and now purfue our
Purpofe in Cielings. A principal Point is, that the Work rife, and
that its Force unite with the Life; that is, that the Objects in the low-
ell Parts be not painted fronger than the fixed Work, as Compart-
forethort-
ments, Bafsreliets, and other Ornaments, which, not being
ened, receive their Light thro' the Windows. Now it may be asked,
Whether, in cale we were to reprefent an Apartment above, with the
same Light as below, the Force of Light and Shade muft not be the
Same? And, I fay, it ought not; becaule of the great Difference between
them; as we may caily fuppole, in two Columns fet over each other,
receiving their Light from one Front, the one from the undermoft, and
the other from the uppermoll Windows: Here, the upper Bale muff
have no more Force than the under Capital; for, were it otherwile, it
would seem to be nearer; it would alfo not rife, and confequently over-
Power the Life. Tis here, as in a fine Landskip; where the Fore-
ground has the greateff Force, and the lecond and third are lels and
tainter in Proportion as they go off. It is the fame with fying Fi-
gures; for the Light weakens by their Riling, and the Shades become,
as well as in a Room, by the lurrounding Air, weaker and fainter:
But the Touches and Shades keep their Force.
We have obferved what is necellary to the Stability and Regularity
of the rchirecture, with reipect to Painting, to that boch may teem
to be one Body; as we thall exemplity by the following Fable out of
Ovid, proposed here as a painter like simile.

Solmacis, meeting Hermapbroditus, and imagining her Happinels lay
in the Poffeffion of to beautiful an Object, falls in love with him;
but, finding a Repulfe, the invokes the Aid of the Gods, and thereby
obtains her earneff Suit. The young Man, not daring to refift the
Will of Heaven, gives up the Caufe, and is, by Mercury, (whom we
mud obterve here to be Opfres) joined to her, and thus of two Bo-
des is made one. Further Applications are needlets, fince the Simile
fufficienly explains itfelf.
Now, to continue our Subject, the following Obfervables are, at
the Beginning of the Work, chiefly neceffary.
1. The Condition of the Place.
2 The Quility, Ofice, and Inclination of the Owner, and what
Subjects are proper trereto, whether Hiffories, Fables, Cec.
3. The Dispeftion of the Subjects.
4 How the Subject is to be divided.
Firtt, By the Condition of the Place, I mean, the Light of the
Room, and in what manner it takes the Cieling; allo, into how many
Pannels the Archirect has divided the Cieling, and which is the Prin
cipal, that we may adapt our Thoughts thereto, in the Dispofition
of the Reprefentations, as well as in the Execution of them.
Seconlly, By the Quality, &cc. of the Owner we mult underfland,

wherner he be a Dirine or Lawyer, Pholofopher or Artifan; and
whether ke incline to (piricual or moral, general or particular Repre
fentations; that is, fuch as relate to him or his Family in particular,
or generally to any who may live in the Houfe after his Deceafe; ac
cording to which information we ought to chufe Subjects fuitable.
Thirdly, How the Subjetts ought to be disposed; namely, what mult
be placed above in the Air, wherein, as is faid, lies the Soul of a
Resz-painting, and what below as touching the Body of it: This we
divide into Spiritual and Meral; Spiritual, all that is governed by
Heaven, and Moral, every thing that is directed by our Judgment.
Fourchly, How the Subject is to be divided: Here, the principal
Piece in the middle, muff thew either the Caufe or Rife of the Story,
or the Efect of it; the next to it mult exhibit the Matter itfelf, and
that further off, an Appendix to or inference from it. But, to make
this Point plainer, I thall give an Example.
in the middle Pannel, 1 place Solemon before the Ark of the Covenant,
praying to Ged for Wifdem, and on each Side, I reprefent, furrounded
with a Glory, the Gifts which God beftows on him; as Wifdom and Rick
es flowing doxn. And in the leffer Pannels, I exhibit, in Bals-reliet,

Subject whatfoever; and by having due Regard to the aforefaid four
Particulars, and well executing them, fuch a Reprefentation will cer.
cainly pleafe every one, even Envy itfelf.
Hence, we may fufficiently perceive, how orderly we mult manage:
Wherefore tis no Wonder, that to few excel in Cieling-painting, tho'
it have Rules as well as other Studies; but if thefe be not duely ob-
served, we cannot gain the Point. He who fets up for a good Mafter,
muft thew that he underftands his Art.
If I am asked, whether I think Correggio, Cortond, Vovet, and o-
thers, who performed Wonders in this Branch, have always to puncty-
ally followed the Rules, and fo nicely regarded all the Obfervacions
here laid down according to my Apprehention! 1 antwer, that it
would have been better if they had done it; or elfe what 1 fay, mult,
2s I have thewed in a foregoing Chap. be owing to the Machine with
Puppets, which I made ule of for 4 or y Vears, and afterwards laid
alide; for, we ought firft to have a thorough Knowledge of a Thing,
and then demonttrate it. But I am further of Opinion, that had the
great Mafters perfectly known the prefcribed Rules, we should not
find fuch great Miltakes in their Works as some now think there are.
Nevertheless its moft certain that none are qualified for this Judgment,
but thole who have made it their Practice; for he who underftands
the Rules, and retains them in Memory, can always judge whether
they be obferved, or not, tho' not able to do it himfelf: Vet they
who work only by Guels, and know nothing of Grounds and Rules.
are more pardonable than thofe who are acquainted with them, and do
not ufe them; tho' both blame-worthy, the one for his Carelessness
and Neglect of Learning, and the other for his Knowledge and Neg
lelt of uling it.
I am very fenfible, that fome will make little Account of many
Things by me delivered as neceffary; but I am in no Pain for that, if
I can but give Satisfaction to a curious Reader.
I mull own, that, in my juvenile Vears, I dawbed some Cie-
lings, but never flatter’d myself that 1 underffood the Art to as I
ought; becaute I was then ignorant that there were any certain Grounds
and Rules.. Neverthelets, I afterwards attained them, by fomctimes
hearing others difcourfe about them, and by the Rules of Perspective,
and by my own indefacigable Applicacion to to noble a Study; info-
much, that at laff I could sketch a large and grand Compolition with
more

more Certainty and less Trouble than formerly a little one. I mutt,
on this Occafion, relate what Courfe I took.
I had, in my Room, a little jurty Clolet; and, when I was to make
an Ordonnance, pinn’d my Paper againtt the upper Part of it, and,
having a Candle in one Hland, and a Crayon in the other, I laid my.
felf on my Back, and fcrarch’d my Thoughts on the Paper. Thisl
found to be a good Method, for preventing Miltakes; I mean, in the
Sketch. Now, for the Painting it, I allo did it againft the Cieling;
yet not after fuch a flight Scratch: For, having made my Sketch, 1
took our of the Prints of Povet and others, fuch Actions and Poltures
as were proper; altering them either in the Faces, Hands, or Folds
of Draperies, more or lets, by Guess, as well as I. could. Thus I
made thift; yer all was done againt the Cieling: Whereby you may
judge, what Trouble I had, as well in finding Things, as afterwards
in executing them; which really was double Work. But, when better
informed, I fat commodioutly at my Eafel. He who proceeds with
Certainty has a great Advantage above others.
C H A P. IX. Mched for drawing foresportened Buildings, Figures,
Trees, &cc. after the Life.
7IN CE r commonly happens, on Nature's denying her faroura-
Lo ble Affittance, that we have Recourfe to our Wits, for Means to
tupply the Defect; it was even my Cafe in Cieling-painting. Af
ter having given myself much Trouble to no Purpofe, and taken ufe-
lets Pains, in order to delign every thing after the Life, I at laft found
out the following Mechod, which has made me full Amends. Tis
very profitable in all Pieces with low Horizons, as you will perceive
in the Uic.
1 suppote then, for Intance, that I am to make a Delign of the
Stadt-houle at Amgerdam (tis no matter if it were thrice its prefent
Heighe) and this without looking up. I chule a Station or Diftance of
eight Feet, more or lets, from the Building, as Occafion requires.
Then, I take a Convex Looking-glats, of about a Foot Diameter (1o
be bought at the Auremberg Toy-thops) and place it againft the Intide
of my Drawing-board, or Porto-folio: I contrive it in fuch Manner,
that it may either sland upright, or leaning back, according as I would
fee Things either from beneach, or higher. Thus 1 approach with
the

the open Porto folio, and my Back towards the Object, till the Build
ing, Tree, Coc. appear as I would have it, and then delign it from
the Looking-glats, on white or blue Paper.
This Method is very convenient for drawing all Sorts of large
Works in narrow Places or Streets; even, a View of twenty or thirty
Houfes. Tis alfo ufeful to Landskip- painters in their Country Views:
They may take whole Tracts of Land, with Towns and Villages,
Waters, Woods, Hills, and Sea, from Ealt to Wefl, without moving
either Head or Eyes. Tis likewife proper for thofe who are ignorant
of Perspective.
We mult here allo thew a Method for reprefenting all Sorts of fore-
portned fat-faced Ordennances, whether Pictures, Hangings, or Bals-
reliess, againtt Walls, Cielings, or any where elfe, either flanding,
hanging, or lying, and that with Certainty, according to Perspettive.
Thefe are Things which Painters often meet with, in exhibiting
Rooms, Galleries, Gardens, and other Places; and the Method for
doing it, tho' not attended with Difficulty, yet, fometimes purzles thofe
who neglect it.
I have therefore cholen the Example in Plate LXIV. which is the
Foundation of all Forethortnings, as well of Apartments as Cielings;
and the Performance is as follows. Having made the Scheme of a
Room in Perspettive, I divide the Height and Widch of the Side-
Wall (where I would have Hlangings or Reprefentations of Pictures
into a certain Number of diminithing Feet, fetching the Crofs-lines
from the Point of Sight, and the Perpendiculars from the Plan or
Sale.
Now, in this Example, we perceive four principal Ferehorinings:
For A is the Cieling, B a Side-wall, C the Floor, D a loofe Picture
hanging forwards; all four proceeding, after one and the fame Man-
ner, from the Point of Sight, as the middle Part E Thews, which is
divided into Squares. To fay more, would be ufelets and tedious to
thofe who are in the leaff converfant with this Art.

Deity would neverthelets keep its proper Colours, yet lets in Foree,
in Proportion to the Diffance: Fer when the uppermoft Croup is fe:
off againt the light Sky, it caules a wonderful Gooff; and the Reaton
proceeds from the Skys feeming to be infinitely higher; which con-
trarywife cannot be effected.
If it be objected, that fuppoling one of the principal Figures in the
uppermoft Group, ought, according to its Dignity and the Reafons
laid down in the fuiring of Colours, to have a white Dress, and
therefore the aforefaid Polition will be overthrown I deny it; for it
may be helped, by difpoting some dark Clouds behind, which will
preferve that Garment in its Force, and make it have a pleating Har-
mony with the reft of the Work. In the Difpolition of Objects, over,
near, and behind each other, we have more largely handled this Point,
and shewed its Truth and Decorum: For, Dark againtt Light cannot
advance with to much Force as the Light may againtt the Dark; be-
caute the Light has greater Strength in itfelf. However, to put an
End to a Point of to great a Latifude, which by Dilcourfe cannot be
fully demonffrated, I shall conclude it with the great Tunius, who, in
his third Book of the Art of Painting, fays,
Thus we see, that Artifs, in their Werks, create Shades or Depths,
to the end that the Parts to come eut may appreach with more Force, and
seem to meet the Exe of the Beholder, even without the Picture. Let
two parallel Lines, (ays Longinus, & be drown upon a Cloth, with light
and dark Colours; the Brightness of the Light will Joonet strike the
Eye; and seem to be nearet. And, a little further, quoring Johannes
Grammaticus, he fays, f If we paint a Board with White and Black,
the White will always seem to be nearer, and the Black further off.
Therefore, continues the fame Author, in his Obfervation on this Point,
the Painters also make use of blackish or dirkish brown Colburs, when they
are to represent the deep Hollow of a Well, Ciftern, Ditch, bottomless Pir,
or the like. But when, on the contrary, they will make any thing come
out, as, the Breafts of a Woman, an Hand held ont, or the Fect of a
leaping or running Herse, they ley, on both the Sides, a jufficient Shade of
black and brown Colours, in order that these Parts may; by the neighbour-
ing Darkness, be flung of from the Picture with a lively Ferce.

CH AP. XI. Of the Deities in facred and prosane History, and
Paties; and, firt, of the Difference between a facred and profane Re-
fitzntaritn.
A V IN G done with trearing of Cieling-pieces, I thought it
improper to end this Book, and make a new one of the following

Chapters; becaute the Mlatter has fuch a Connexion, that we
can fcarce think of the one, without falling prefently on the other.
Irs certain, that in common Pictures the Deiries, Gholls, Demi-
gods, Angels, Virtues, and other Powers may likewife be introduced,
nay, are even infeparable Adjuncts: But into Cieling-pieces, where
the Upper-part is the Shy, they muft of Necefficy come; becaute the
major Part of fuch Reprefentations relate either to their Perfons, Qua-
lities of Virtues.
Now, duely to execute this Reprefentation of the Deiries, the Ar-
tifl ought chiefly to be acquainted with the facred and profane
Sterres, as well as with the poetical Fictions, that he may learn from
them the partucular Occurrences and Properties peculiar to each Per-
ion and Rank of the Deiries or Upper-powers, and reprefent them
accordingly; for altho' Imaginution mult, in this Point, lend great Af
Lillance, yer its not fafe for every Man to rely intirely thereon, left
he should be deceived; like the Man, whofe Neighbour dreaming,
that in a certain Place was hidden great Treafure, and awaking and
going thither, found it, by digging, and carried it home; he, on this
good Luck, laid himfelf down on an Heapof Poppies, in hopes of the
lame Happinets; but after a long Sleep he awaked without any ad-
vantageous Intimation from his Dream; contrarily, found his Pocket
pick’d, and thus at once was bereft of his Hopes and the Money he
before had in Poffettion. This Simile is too plain to need nearer Ap
plication
A judicious Mafter muft certainly be well exercifed in the Know-
ledge of the true Conditions of the Things he is to handle, that he
mar not be thought an lgnoranc; for the Truth cannot be hidden
with respect to the Inventor. Wherefore you ought to take heed of
mixing this Truth with falfe Things, especially in facred Stories, of
(piritual Reprefentations; fince there is to great a Genrrariety between
them, that they cannot be joined, unlets to thew the Difagreement:
1fy.


Cielings, or Plafonds.
Chap. II.
469
I fay, they cannot poffibly be joined in order to exprets a fingle Mean-
ing, but will rather ferve to confound, weaken and miltake it, except
they be feparately difpoted, the spiritual above, in Heaven, and the
werldly below, on the Earth. I speak with respelt to Emblems: For
there is a great Dilparity between Pallas and the Wifdem of God,
fince the latter cannot be attributed to any Perfon, and much less re-
prefented on Earth. The fame may be said of Janus and Provi-
dence. The begventy and civil Tuffice are alfo very unlike. We
mult therefore note, that the whole lconology or Science of the
heathenith Figures, tho' formerly accounted heavenly, has now
no relation to the Soul, but to the moral Vircues and Merits of
Men.
Let us then inquire, with Reverence, what are Chriflian Emblims,
and what, prefane or Heathenish; uting in spiritual Representations no-
thing but what is pure and heavenly, and in the worldly, all thats
proper to them, in order to gain the Elleem both of religious and
Worldly Pertons.
A Paffage in Scripture mentions the driving Lucifer and his Compa-
nions out of Heaven: Whence we may plainly conclude, that thote
Monfters afterwards fell to the Share of the Heathens, as no longer
pertaining to the Saints. But we do not find, after that Time, any
more fuch unruly Spirits were expelled Heaven; wherefore we are not
allowed to reprefent more fuch Inftances. But in the Cafe of Men
seen to battle the true Faich, Things may be accompanied and repre-
fented with heathenith Emblems; becaute, as is faid, the Heathear
gave themfelves up to the Devil; the better by that means to ex-
prets their Error, and thew the Truth, thus alfo driving them out of
Heaven.
It is, upon Occafion, likewife not improper or difagrecing with the
Pharifees or Hypocrifes; but has a greater Weight in tillicious Stories
or Parables. Nor can we, without Offence, introduce other Emblems
than Chriffian like, when they only tend to incite to Salvation. In
which Cale we may reprefent Angels or Spirits, to keep thofe Hypo-
Crites out of Heaven
in true profane Hifferies, as the Reman, Grecian and others, this
Management would be improper, but we may lawfullvule bereghphic
and other Characters; of which there is an infinity; for inftance, by
2religious Perfon, a white Garment, or an Offering cup; by a cruel
one, a Tyger's Skin or Dragon, either on his Helmet or Shield. Ir
would be prepofterous to place a Veftal Virgin by Numa Pompilins, in

C H AP. XII. Disquistion toucbing the Representation of the
Trinity.
RANY will think this Subject beyond the Reach of what we
II have hitherto handled, and inconfiftent with Art: But I am
of a contrary Opinion; for a tender-hearted Arcil has, of A.
count of the many Differences among Chrillians, Reaton to be in
Concern for this Point, fince fo many Occurrences offer in Scripture,
where the Almighty is either acting in some Form about Mankind,
or is pailing by as a Glory to make his Prefence known.
The greatelt Part of Chrizendom (Helland, England, and a Part of
Germanr excepted) allow, with one Accord, the Reprefeataion of the
Perfons in the Trinity; as firlt, Gad the Futher, in the Shape of an old
Man with a long grey Beard and Hair: Secondly, Frus Cirjz, as he
appeared in his Humanity. And Thirdly, Ged the Hol. Giz., in the
Shape of a Dove, in which Shape he dehended on fiyes Cirt, at
the Time of his Baptilnm.
Now if, according to the Letter of Ser:prure, I were to repretent
Ahum and Ere, I and it neceltary to exhib: the Creaior of the World

by a certain Mechod of underitanding, we comprehend! For it is not
the Marres ittelf.
I think, that the learned World and Arcifts reprefent the firtt Per-
fon of the Trinity rather in the Shape of a Man, than of any other
Creature, on good Reafons; for we learn from Scripture, that God
creared and made Man in his own lmage; and from the ancient Fathers,
Char Wan is an Exitome of all that God created; who is therefore called
1

the aorle World: Some even call Man the Mafter-piece of God. We
oight therefore, if we will take some Likeness from the Creatures, to
exprets the Almighty by the mot perfect Idea to be found, in order
to exhibit his Perfection, and thus to make the Copy, in the beff
Manner, like the Original: And the more, as Scripture, in feveral
Places, makes mention of the Head, Eyes, Ears, Mlouth, Lips, Arms,
Feet, Hands, and other Members of God: Which Things mult not be
underffood in a carnal and literal Senfe (according to the Opinions of
some ignorant People, who imagine God, in his Nacure, to be like a
Man; that he firs in Heaven on a Throne, according to a Pallage in
-The Herven is my Throne, and the Earth is my Footfiool.
Laise,

And as in another Place the fame Prophet fays—I faw the Lord
fitting es in bige Tbrone, and lifted up—) but in a figural and fpiri-
tual Senie. I think then, that a Painter has no nearer Exprestions, in
tuch Reprefenrations where God himself is alting, than to exhibit his
Figure in an human Shape, as beft agreeing with thofe Likenelfes,
WVe paint him aged, in order to thew his Majefty and Wifdom, which
are more to be found in Old Age than Vouth; and with a Scepter and
Globe, and a Circle of Stars about his Head, to shew his Omnipo-
cence boch in Heaven and on Earth. But Roman-catholicks daily make
Additions.
If the Scripture reprefent his Godly Perfon under a myfterious Senfe,
why may not the Arcift be allowed to do the fame! Do we not read
in the Recelation what is mentioned of God in an human Shape! Is it
not plain enough? Or muft it be objected, that this Discription is
poctyphal? But granting it, the Relation, nevertheless, is not at-
counted ffearbenifh. ny Doubt, which might arife from it, does not
affect the Point, with respect to Shapes. In another Place we find, that
the High -Prieff hid himself, that he might not behold the Lord:
Bur the Lord put a Finger on his Eyes, till he was paft by. How
can 1 reprefent that Paltage, without a Body? Or is it no Falll

Fire. Now, to make this known to a Perfon who cannot read, and is
deaf, Is it not more caly to do it by a Reprefentation, than by Sigas?
Are we to make only a Mouth fending forch a Flame? Is this to
proper for fuch a Man's Apprehention, as a whole Figure? Moreover,
1s not a Mouth a Likencis and a Figure, as well as a whole lmage?
What then are they pretending, who allow one Part of the Crime,
and not the Whole? If ir be a Crime, let it be intirely forbidden;
and if good, or at leaff fufferable, intirely allowed, and performed.
Neverthelels, we mult not bow before these Ibings, much less worship them,
but the true God only, who is thereby meant. Can we oblerve a Sacri-
fice otherwife? Is not that a myfterious Reprefentacion, or, in better
Terms, a figural Demonftration, when it is faid — The Sucrifice
was burning upon the Altar, and the Children of God were bowing before
it, praying, befeeching, and giving Tbanks in all Submisfion?
Scripture, in feveral Places, (peaks of the appearing of God te
Men, either really by the Miniftry of Angels, or in a Vifion by
Dreams, of by Extafies. There is to fine a Description of God, undet
the Shape of an old Man, in the leventh Chapter of Daniel, that no
Artill can better reprefent it. The same Scripture alfo mentions feve-
ral Appearances of Angels in human Shapes: For which Reafon, the
Church, in the lecond Council of Nice, made no Difficulty in alloxing
Artifts to do it; and chiefy Painters, to reprefent God the Futher as a
kind, loving old Man, and the Angels in an human Shape.
It feems allo, that a Painter has the Privilege to paint and repre-
fent inanimate Things as living, according to the Idews which Scripture
affords him: And the Spectator mult not be offended, when, in fome
Pittures, he finds facred Subjects attended with poetical Fictions, for
their better Explanation; on a Supposition the latter be impious. Are
not the Pfalms of David, Solomon's Song, the Bock of Job, and the
Revelation of St. John the Divine, all delivered under Poetic Figures?
Not to speak of the Parables befides mentioned in Scripture.
Painters therefore are not blame worthy, for bringing in some
thing that is hearhenifh, in order to clear the Alatter; and elpecially if
the Falt happened in an heathenith Country. Thus the great Ro-
phacl, in his Pasfage of the Children of Ifracl over Lordan, has repre-
fented the River under an human Shape, violently turning the Water
back towards its Source.
As Scripture often lays down fuch and the like Things under fome
fgural Descriptions, it gives Painters full Liberty to do the fame;
fince, in order to accommodate ittelf to the weak Apprehentions of

Men, it ufarlly delivers many of the greateff Myfteries under Figures
and Parables; as it speaks of the Rivers, in Pfalm xevin. &
Pouffin alfo made no Scruple, in his Picture of the finding of Mofes,
to exhibit the River Nile, by an human Figure. But there were Ca-
lumniaiors in his Time as well as there are now. He was charged
with Ackeim, for mixing Truth with Lyes, and having no more Re
gard for either, than to treat them alike. Vet, if we look nearer
12t0 this Matter, we shall be convinced, that the learned Painter was
Ro: in the leat cinctured with Acheifm. Did it not happen in hea-
trenih Eeger? Was not Pharach's Daughter prefent? Did the believe

tne Trum, which was only manifelted to Graelf Certainly the did not.
Since therefore the Falt lay in an heathenith Country, and was done in
the Prefence of but two Hebrex Women, the others being Ethnicks,
this great Artiff has not trespafied either againft the Chriflian Farth, or
againtt the Art.
And alcho, at the firft View, a well grounded Objection may be,
that with Things which relate to Religion, no falle Gods or Deiies,
worthipp’d by the Heathens, ought to be mixed; and that it is fuffi-
cient for a Painter to reprefent a River in its natural Courfe, and not
in an himan Form: Fer the Objection is eafily anfwered; for Scrip-
ture repreients the Waters, and the Noise of Rivers, under an human
Form; as in Pfalmxevin. where it is faid, that they clapp’d their Hands
and were jorsal. Moreover, the Egyptians never worthipp’d the Ri-
vers, but the Crocodiles living in them; and Is, under the Shape of
2 Cow, as Or:d, and other Writers tellifj.
Since then Scripture makes ufe of allegorical Speeches, a Painter
may allo exhibit his Subject under fymbelical and perceptible Likenefes,
in order to be the more incelligible to the Spectator, without Fear
that his Work will miflead faithful Chrillians, or ftrengthen heathenith
Superflition; for a Painter, who has no other Language to express
himself by, but Figures, ought to make ufe of them, if he would be
underftood.
Rubens, who of all the Painters handled thofe Tumbolical Figures
in the molt agreeable and learned Manner (as we may particularly ob
ferve in the Curdinal Infunt’s Entry into Antwerp, and in the Painting
of the Luxemburgh Gallery) is taxed by fome with mixing, in thote
Compositions, Truth with Fictions: But how eafily is this Judgment
to be refured, by shewing the Ufe that judicious Artiff made thereof

to exprets it by the fillizious Characters and Emblems.
I pray oblerve, in his Birthof the French King, Lewis XIIl. how that
excellent Artiff has exhibited Caffer with an arrful Sway, on diflant
Clouds fitting on his winged Horle, and oppofice to him Apolle, who, in
his radiant Charior, is driving upwards, in order to thew, that this Prince
was happily berninthe Morning. Hereby it is evident, that this ingenious
Mafter had no Thoughts of reprefenting Deities as Deines, but only to
denote, by Caffer (as accounted an happy Confiellation) the Kings
fortunate Birth; and by Apolle, the Time of the Day, which was in
the Morning, appearing by his Chariors mounting up from the
Horizon.

the Appearance of his Loins even downwards, as it were the Appearance

never to be represented without a Glittering or Glery from Head to Foot;

We have before curforily thewed, why we reprefent the Almighty
as a venerable old Man: And shall now further infift on the Pont,
tho' without reference to all the Paltages in Scripture, which might
ferve our Purpofe. In Duniel, Chap. Vii. 9. Tis written,  1be
Heir of tis Head was like pure Wool, and his Gurment white as Snow.
- The Reason wbereof, Lays Gregorius Nezianzenas, is to shew
thereby, as by an infullible Token, his clean and andefited Being. Where-
fore the wife Exicherns is allo of Opinion, that for the same Reason
the Ceir and Maltitude of Angels are represented in White. Others
compare it to the human Shape, and would thereby allude to infinite
Durarn, fince nothing is to eternal as the Godhead. Which I re-
mark here, becaute some fcrupulous Perfons are of Opinion, that we
ought not to reprefent God the Father in fuch a Shaps, aforned with
White Garments and grey Hair.
And, on this Account, all Nations have, by an univerfal Confent,
thought proper to perform divine Service in whice Garments and Or
naments. The Whice has alto been at all Times appropriated to the
holy Service. Wherefore the Poet Perfins lays, — He is wersipped
in Waite.
But what is Perfas's Saying to us, fince the Raiment of Fefts

ment; however, its not improper, to make it look more natural, that
you keep it a litle yellowith, as lighted by a Sun, or like the Glory
which furrounds the Figure.
But in all this, a Painter must be very discrect, and not abuse the li-
cence allowed him by Scripture and the Consent of the Fathers, or by
his Art gervert the facred Truths or flight them.

A VIN G thew’d in what Manner, and on what Terms, ac
cording to my Judgment, to reprefent the Almighty, let ws

now inquire how the Angels, in their Power, ought to be exhibited
6rt


Cielings, or Plafonds.
Chap. Ij.
477
Gregerins Nuxianzenns lays, that the true Property of the Angels, when
they appear in a badity Shape, is, to have a bright Glery and glittering
Garments. We find the ngels thus defcribed in Matt. xxviil. 7. in
Mark xvi. s. in 4i7s i. 10. and many other Places of Scripture.
This glittering Light of the Angels ought therefore by all means
to be obterved in moll of their Appearances: As for Inflance in thofe
co Araham, and in the delivering Lot out of Sodom, where they
fmore the lutful People with Blindness: For irs certain, they had
fomething more than human, fince Abrabam lalures them as Lords.
Tis not likely, that this Honour proceeded from their coflly Dress,
lewels and other precious Things about them, but from some heaven
ly or uncommon Addition.
A further Proof of this Glory of the Angels, is, the fore preffing
of the Sedemites upon Lor, and their not covecing either him of his.
Daughters, or any other Strangers probably living among them,
but only thefe two young Men to be brought out, in order to Know
them: And perhaps becaute of their more than human Form, and
charming Brightnets. If now this Glory had thone too firong, they
would have perceived fome Deiry,
and forbore their Wickednets;
for it cannot be imagined, that any Man should daringly and know-
ingly frive againtt the Almighty.
But, before we proceed further, I muft here deliver my Opinion,
touching the Perfon of Fefus Chriff; which is, that in his Humanity
and before his Resurrection, he ought to be reprefented without the
Seaft Shining or Glory; fince he was made in the Likeness of Men,
and would be like his Brechren in all Things, except Sin, as Scripture
relifies: But after his Resurrection, he should be shewn with a Glory:
(as we read he appeared to his Dilciples on Mount Taber, and in other
Places) as having thea put off his Humanity in its principal Purpofe.
Now, to proceed.
We have further inffances of the Appearance of Angels, as in those
who came to Manuah, Gideon and Tobit,. and him who imote the Peo-
ple of Terufalem for David's Sin, C8c. Of the firft, Scripture expretty
lays, that be, forecelling Manoah the Birth of Samfon, ascended in
the Flame of the Altar; poltibly in an Augmentation of CGlery unicing
with the Flame of the Offering; by which doubling Brightness the
Parentsof Samson were Rrengthened in their Faith and Hope of the
Birth to come.
If this Glory now be painted too frong and like Lightning, it blinds
our mortal Eyes, and thus the Patriarch Abrabam could have viewed

it no more than the Prophet and Leader of Irael, Mloses, when God
appeared to him, and patied before his Face: And this Glory would
deffroy a Beholder.
The blind Heathens had Glimmerings of this Truth; for when
Semcc prefumptuoully defired, that Tuprter might once embrace her
in the tame Majefty as he did June in Heaven, and infifted on it, not-
Withflanding his Diffuation to the contrary, the was, on the Requeft
granted, intirely confumed by the attending Glory of the God, info-
mgh that with Difficulry he faved the Child he had by her.
Whence it's plain, that the Glory, even in exhibiting the Heathenish
Deities, ought to be oblerved; fince in their Appearance to Men ei-
ther by Night or Day, to bless or punith them, they recained their
full Force, Glory and Majelty; and this being weighed, they mull al.
to be reprefented glittering, beautiful in Aspect and Shape, and in Rai-
ment of an elegant Colour, as much as portible, and the Nature and Ule
of the Picture will permit; as we have before hinted in the bandling
of Colours in Cieling-pieces.
But when the Derties appear among Men, as Men, then they ought
to be like them, and not eafily diftinguithable, otherwife than by their
Mien: s, for inftance, in the Story of Tupiter with Califfe, Apello
with Daptne, Tupiter with Lycaen, Mercury with Argas, and the
like: In fuch Cales, and that they might the better play their Parts,
they transformed themfelves incirely inco Men, and were perfectly like
them, laying afide all God-like Glory and Shape, as if, according to
the Opinion of the Heathens, they meant, that there can be no Union
of the divine with human Nature.
As to the Aotions of the heathenith Deiries, many reprefent them
appearing in altive Poftures, as walking, running, and other Motions;
but its as contrary to my own Opinion, as that of the great Bihop of
Hippe, Heliedoras. This learned Man, and great Searcher into heathen
ith Annquiries, will not allow them to go or walk when seen in their Ma-
ie2j, but only to ware; or teem in some meature to walk, yet gliding
like a Ship moved gently along by the Wind, without perceptible
Motion: They ought always to be fet out with rhin Glouds, of which,
Iuch as are neareff them receive a greater and Rronger Light.

C H AP. XIV. Of the Representations of Angels and beathenisss
Genil.

H E Almighty, in the Beginning, created an infinite Number of
Angels or heavenly Spirits, who
in Scripture, are diffinguished
by Names, as Serapbins, Cherubins, Ibrones, Powers, Arch-angels,
Angels, Exc.
The firll, as being neareft to the Glory of the Almighty, are als
ays reprelented young and harmless, and with six Wings, according to
Haiab, Ch.vi.
The second are exhibited only for the sake of Motion, and to denote
the Efficacy of eternal Happinels; which their undefited Purity and
childifs Form give to undertland.
The third, who continually attend Gods Juffice (as Dionyfius 44.
respagita, St. Pauls Dilciple, writes) are somewbat older, and more
full-grown, and of an agreeable Sway and Motion; cauting, by their
Appearances, no Fear or Fright, but Joy and Gladness in People's
Minds.
The fourth are appointed to execute divine Vengeance in the Punith-
ment of Sins and Wickednels: Of thefe, one was to frong, that, with
the Almighty's Permiffion, he fmore, in the Camp of the Aprians,
18g000 Men, 2 Kings xix. 2 Chron. xxxii. Juigh xxxvii. Thefe are
reprefented bigger than the former, having fern Countenances, and vie-
lent Motions; are seldom or never naked, but in Geats of Armour, and
with a faming Sword or Thunder in their Hands, or elfe a shield on
their Arms, with the Name of God glittering thereon. By-their unex
petted ppearance they caule not only Fear and Fright in the Wicked..
but a continual Remorfe without Repentance.

thing that betokens Evil.
As to the Angels before mentioned, who, in all Ages, have been
reprefented with Wings, Scripture allows us the Libercy to to exhibit
them: For the Almighty himself thewed Moses the Partern of the 41h
of the Covenant, and the Cherabins, in this Nianner, upon it. Can any
Example be more perfect than his ? More inflances in Scripture may
he found in the Prophecies of Duniel, Ch. ix. 2i. Jaiah vi. Rev. iv.
Kachiel x. Eec.
Having thus far treated of the Reprefentation of Angels, we hall
now thew the Opinion of the Heathens, not ill agreeing with the fame
Meaning.
Platurch tells us, that the ancient Remons had alfo their turelar
Guardians, by them ttiled Genis, or Birth gods: But they were not
reprefented as ngels, or litting on Clouds, or with Wings, or Glo.
ries, but as well-shap’d joung Men between 16 and 20 Years of Age, and
without Beards, having long light Hair, composed Countenances, and cay
Metions, and a Dog’s Skin over their Upper-parts.
The Reaton of this Cloaching was, as Chryssppus fays, that they, as
good Spirits, attend us from our Narivities, being Guardians of our
Altions, in reproving Vice, and revenging Trantgreffions, as often 25
we prefer Brurality before Humanity, which the Genis abhorr’d, pur
iuing and barking at us, in order to awake the Confcience. Of which
Opinion is Cenforimas, and feveral others whom he quores; adding,
that thefe Spirits watch to narrowly, that they never leave us, incit
ing as to Virtue, in Proportion as we fortake Vice, and covet Felicity.
Bot why need we thefe Examples! Our Saviour affirms, that the An.
pels bois Charge ever as, to condutt and preferve us, as we have before
said: Wherefore, the Heathens, by this Emblem, have alfo rightly
Rited ther Gemi, Guardians.

Cenforimas likewife teffifies, that the Ancients confidered their Genir
as Gods of Precreation, either that, as we have faid, they took care
of us, or were born with us; for which Reafon, they believed, there
were as many Genis as Men, and that each had his own: Or elfe, that
there were twice as many, and that each Man had a good one and
an evil one, the former perfeading to Virtue, and the latter to Vice;
agreeable to what Chriflians fay of their Guardian Angels and the
Devil, this laft not failing to afflict Mankind, tho' not born with us,
as the Heathens believ’d of their Genir. Hence it is, that some re-
prefent the Genii in the Shape of a Serpent, others, as Children or
young Men; or elfe, as grey-headed old Men, conformable to the
Philolopher Gebes, in his heroglyphical Table.
Gorouffer, and the ancient Philofophers have made a Diltinction be-
tween the nimals confecrated to the good and evil Genii; according
to them, Dogs, Forwls, and the Tortorfe are proper to the Good, and
Water-animals peculiar to the Evil.
The Ancients often exhibired the Geis crowned with Gurlands of
Hercbound, the Leaves whereof much refemble thofe of the Vine, or
elle with Chaplets of divers Sorts of Flowers; as Tibullus, in a certain
Place, lays,— The Genins is adorned with a beautiful Chaplet of Flow-
ers, when his Name and Feftival are celebrated to his Henour.
Each Perfon worshipp’d his Genins, without knowing it, in celebrating
his Birth-day: And thofe of Princes were especially kept by every
body, with great Splendor; wherefore, he who falfly fwore by the
Gents of his Prince (which was accounted a very great Oath) was an
immediate Delinquent.
Since, as is faid, the Ancients had two Kinds of Genii, a good one,
and an evil one, according to the Socratic Kuclid, as Cenforinas relates,
we shall now confider, how the erit were reprefented.
I do not find the Ancients hal any Statues, or Refemblances of
them, but we read, as Writers rellify, that they appeared to
many.
Pistarch, Appianus, Flerus, and others report, that as Bruths, one
Night (according to his Cultom) had betaken himfelf, with a Light,
to his Apartment, for Meditation, he faw, before him, the Likeness
of a Man, but very black and frightful, cloathed in a Wolfs Skin;
who, being ask’d, who he was? antwerd, — I am thy evit Genins,

cauted him to be beheaded, This Genins appear’d as a large black

The Temessans, formerly inhabitants of Abruzze, a Country in Haly,
had allo a very evil Genins, of a black Colour, and frightful Look,
and cloathed in a Wolf's Skin, doing that People much Damage; 2s
PanJanias and Suidas tellify.
C H AP. XV. Of sacred Emblems.
HE Delign of a well compofed facred Emblem is principally to
edify, and to incite to Virtue; reprefenting it to us, as a
Looking-glats, not to much for the Regulation of our Bodies, as our
Souls, and by fuch Means to bring us to Happiness.
Thefe Emblems are either general or particular. General, when they
fuit any Perion whatfoever; and particular when they relate to one
only. When their Subject is Piety or Virtue, Learning, Liberty,
Peace of Mind, and fuch like, they are general, and applicable to
erery Perfon who poffeffes, or endeavours to poffets thote Qualities:
But when a particular Perfon is their Subject, as, the Virgin Mary, an
Apoitle, of other virtuous Man, who excelled in fome particular Gift,
in fuch Cafe they are particular or fingular. We ought therefore, in
the former Sort, to obferve, that the main Matter is (piritual, and in
the later, corporal: The one exhibirs Learning itfelf, and the other,
a learned Man, or Philofopher one thews Peace, and the other, 2
peaceable Mian; one reprefents Piety, and the other, a pious Man, EC.
The one is the Matter inself, and the other, he who poffeffes it. How.
ever, a judicious Mafter will make a Diffiattion between (piritual
and corporal Vircues, between natural Inclinations, and heavenly Gitis.
The Corporal, as Strength, Prudence, Equity, and the like, proceed
from us, or, in beter Terms, are peculiar to us, walk, fand, and al
with us; and the spiritual and beaventy, and which contequently
8
have no Relation with the Body, are as without us; wherefore, they
muft be reprefented either fitting or lying on Clouds, and the nearer

ing they are to be exhibired.
I am of Opinion, that we ought to adapt particular Sorts of Stufs
to the aforelaid Virtues and Qualicies, according to their Ranks and
Dignitics;

Dignities; as, to cloathe the Eartbly in Stufs and Cloth, and the Hey-
venly, in thick Silk; and thofe fill bigher, in Gause-fearss, or elle to
let them remain naked.
We mull further remark on the laft of thefe, that the Charalters,
call’d the Qyalities of God, I mean figural Charalters, fuch as the
Scepter and Eye, implying Dominion; the circled Serpent; Eternity;
the Sun, Glory; and fuch like, ought always to appear in the uppermet
Glory, as pertaining to the Deity, and are reprefented by lovely waving
Children. Vet, let it be obferved, that thofe Things only respect the
Bleftings of Heaven; for when the Almighty is provok’d, and is to in-
flict Punishments, we muft introduce other Qualiies, fuch as his Wrash,
Tuffice, &c. alfo reprefented by Angels, with Thunder, fiery Swords,
Scales, Coc. but thefe ought to be flronger, and like young Men; as
we find it in Scripture, in the Story of Lot, where they ftruck the So-
domites with Blindnets; and in that of Senmucherib, where an Angel of
the Lord, in one Night, fmore to many Thoulands; and more fuch
Cales.
I shall illuftrate what I have before faid, by further Examples, in
Tuch Manner as I apprehend the Point; and for that Purpofe have
cholen an uncommon Subject, to ferve for a particular
Emblem and stately Monument of ber Majefty, Mary Stuart, late Queen
of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Princess of Orange.
Here, a Tomb is flanding; on the left Side of the Piece, of a
Bafement whereon is carved the River-god of the Thames. In the
Middle of the Piece, on the fecond Cround, a Princess is firting
in Grandeur on a Throne, reprefenting England, with its proper
Badges. She leans her Head on her left Hand, and, with her
Right, opens the royal Robe of the Deceafed, which is lined with Er-
min, and, with the Scepter and Crown, lies in her Lap, whereon the
calls a forrowful Look: She is covered with a black Gaule-weed,
which darkens the Glitter of the Seat and Coat of rms. Policy, on
her left Side, quite dejected, is beholding the Tomb, accompanied by
Sorrow. On the other Side appears the Proteffant Church, languithing,
supported by Hope, who points at the Tomb, whereon flands a large
beautiful antique Vafe, out of which is growing a Rofe-twig, having
but one Bud, whereon Providence, fitting on Clouds, difpentes fome
Moiffure, out of a fmall cryfial Phial, and, with her Scepter, points
upwards at the celeftial Light, to which Wifdem, Piety, and Sted.

high appears Gors Lore or Tenderness, waiting for her with open

It would not be improper to fee the Glory filled with Divine Leve or
Kindnels, as before -mentioned, and Prosperity flowing from it. Fright
and Fear taking to Flight, and Envy, Fraud, and Herefy under Majesy's
Feet.
The aftive Virtues I reprefent by Figures, which hold the
Crown over Majelty's Head, and the Spirnsal, by thofe fitting on
Clouds, Coc.
A Third Example.
The Subject of this shall be Innecence murther’d.
Here Innecence is proftrace, murther’d by raging Impiety. She lies
near an extinguish’d Altar, fretch’d out on the Ground, cloath’d in a
clean white Carment, betokening an upright undefiled Heart. The
cruel Executioner forcibly tears her innocent Child from her Breaft, and
at the fame Time the brutith Murtherer is fepping from the Emi-
nence whereon he fat, in order to go off; he is Raind with innocent
Blood, and, theathing his bloody Sword, tramples under Foot a Pe-
lican with its Toung. Rage accending him, and firing them with her
Torch, is looking back, in great Contternation, at Heaven, which darts
many Thunders at her. There, Divine Jutice is defcending, with
Scales in one Hand, and Thunders in the other. Picty, bowing before
her at the Allar, is praying, and thewing her the innocent Corps:
Thereupon the doubles her Speed to execute Revenge. Now fee the
Wrath of God exprets’d, not with bright Sun beams from on high,
but with fiery and bloody ohes.
Here, Tuffice, or divine Wrath, has a flaming red Garment or Vail.
Impiety is cloath’d in a rully copper-colour’d Drapery. The Excinti-
oner, who mifules the Child, has a cruel Aspect, and is reddith. Over
Innecence, a little Angel is afcending to Heaven, with a bright Star to
which, a long Ray feems to proceed out of Fer Mouth; he has a
Palmbranch in his Hland, to tisuify her Hippiness.
The following is a Chort Skewh of the Achions.
The Head of the Corps lies in the Middle of the Piece, on the
Fore ground, and the Feet towards the right Side, fomewhar nearer to
the Altar, with one Leg a little up, as if there were fill some Life
left. Behind the Alcar, Piery kncels one Knes, which is in Shade,
the receiving her Light from Tyrice, who, on the lecond Ground, is
with her Upper-pares directly over the Point of Sight, and her Feec
tomewhat forethorined towards the right side, from whence the 1s

coming. On the leff Side, on the fame Ground, a little more for-
ward, Imprety and Rage take to Flight. Rage is half chaded by dark
Clouds, over which Heaven opens. The Fore-ground has a right
Light; but Turice receives her Light from behind. On the left Side
of the Piece is a dark Offskip.
Now, as the former Emblem respected the Reward of Virtue, to
this repretents the Punishment of Evit: in that appeared the Love of
Gol; in this, his Wrath.
Thus are my Thoughts on thefe Subjects, not prefuming to have
handled them with the urmoft Accuracy; I am far from giving them
out as perfect Emblems, fince thats the Work of great Judgment, vall
Knowledge, and mature Confideration: Neverthelels, rough as the
Plan is, Tis iufficient for explaining my Sentiments. And as we always
stick either more or less to Art, and hardly keep to much within the
Bounds of Curiofiry, as not to take some Libercies in the Dispofition
of Things, to I have reprefented him, who is taking away the Child,
as an Executioner, naked, his Hair tied with a Cloth, and with a
Dazger lying by him; and Impiousness, as a Prince, with a blood
red Diadem about his Head, and a Staff in his Hand; tho' thefe Fi
sures ought rather to be Women; moreover, the Executioner might
have been left out.
C H A P. XVI. Of the Penates, Lares, and Cupids.
NCIEN T Hiffories relate, that moft Nations which lived under
(A Laws and Policy, especially the Hebrews, Greeks, and Remans,
Figures of Gold, Silver, Copper, or
but moftly thefe latt, had certain
Wood, which they fiiled Dir Penates, in Engliss, Houshold-gods.
Thele they kept as holy, and took fuch particular Care of, that in
cafe they happen’d to be loff, either thro' Carelessness, Violence, of
other Accidents, they thought it foreboded some imminent Dilaffer,
or bad Luck to befal them; and accordingly believed, when any
fuch were at hand, that thofe Gods were erther removing, or va
nithed
The Hifforian Timaus writes, that they were reprefented like two
beautiful young Mex, in a warlike Dress, each with a Tovelin in his
Hand, and by or near them an eartaen Firepan, over which lay twe long

Irembars cress wife, turned at the Ends like the Hazel-wands which the
Augures held in their Hands at the Time of officiating.
Cicero, treating of the Penates, fays, they were certain Gods brought
forth in the Houfes of particular Men, and wershipp’d in the most con-
cealed and private Places of them. And in this Sente Demephoon and
Terence (pake, when they laid, they would go home and bide their House-
hold-gods, before they betook to their Business and Callings.
in Scripture alfo we have the Teraphims, or Houhold gods, which
Rachel fole from her Father Laban, when he went to thear his Sheep;
as the Rabbi Eliezer, in the 36th Chapter of his Difcourfes, largely
treats, (peaking of Laban, and the preparing of the Teraphims.
We have before faid, that the Penafes were in great Efteem among
the Romans; which Dionysus Halicarnaffus affirms, faying, they were
Wworthipp’d at Rome, under the Shape of two fitting joung Men, in very
ancient and warlike Dreffes, and having favelins in their Hands; with
this Subscription, DII PENATES, as we find it sill in ancient Me-
dals. Nigidins was of Opinion, that they were Apolle and Neptune;
and the rather, as by Apolle is meant Heat and Drought, and by Nep-
June, Gold and Moifiness; judging the Worship to owe us Origin to thefe
Effelts: Wherefore, Virgil, in the Righth Book of his Eneids, Riles
them the great Gods, meaning the Penates. Others think, that Tupi-
ter and Tune are lignified by them; becaute their chief Bulinets was to
give Men Help and Affiftance, and therefore they both derive from the
Latin Word Tavare, fignifying to belp or affjf. Others again imagine
them to be Cafter and Pollux; becaute they, with the Penate: or
Houlhold gods, were allo, according to the ancient Poets and Hillori-
ans, in very great Efteem, and the Roman Worthip affigned them the
firtt Places in their Temples.
It will here be proper to deduce fomething, touching thefe Gods, from
Antiquity, the becter to illultratce the Point.
We read, that when the Daughter of Pallantes was married to Dar-
danus, the brought, in Dower, the Gifts which Pallas had made her
a Prefent of, being an oblong Shield dropt from Heaven (which the
Rild Palladium) and the Figures of the Penates or great Gods. After-
wards, on a Rebellion breaking our in Pelopennesus, where Dardanys
and his Wife lived, he, with many of the Arcadians, fied from
thence, taking Shipping for Samothracig, where, in Confideration of
those Gifts, brought as a Portion, he buill a Temple, infliruting pri-
vate Solemnities for their Religious Worthip, keeping them fecret
from the common People, in a Vault under the Ground; and foon

after, on his Departure for Assa, took them with him, and placed
them in Durdama, to called from his Name. His Son Wus, being im-
ploy’d in bulding liam, or Troy, tranfplanted thofe Gods thither.
£is afterwards, having faved them out of the Flames of that
City, carried them to Pay, placing them in the City of Lavinmum.
Afcinits, his Son, removed them to the City of 41ba, where he dedi-
cated a large and magniicent Temple to their Honour. But, they

wall and Roof of the Temple found incire, and without any Breaches.

zin Miracle very much turprizing Afcanins, he fent to Larinmum
633 Men, called Caratores, of whom Eggins was Chief, to guard the
Gods. At lait, being carried to Rome, they remained without any
Alteration, and the Roman People committing to them the Care and
Protection of their City, and growing Empire, placed them, in lmita-
tion of Derdanis (that they might not be fioln either by Fraud or
Violence) in a Vaule or Temple under Ground, wherein, after Confe.
cration, they ofter’d Sacritices to them; not allowing any Perfon to pit
in this Temple, becaute the Gods, like 1gls, were worthipp’d with
Fire.
They were reprefented as young Men, and fitting, with Tavelins in
their Hands, to lignify their being adored as Alaintainers and Protec-
fors; for the Sitting, hicroghphically, expreffes Stedfastness in what
ve desen to dr: The Tarelins imply, that they preserve from Harm
and Difzzer; and the Touthfulness denotes the Increase of their
Pbwer.
The Lires were much like the Penates, at leaft in the Guard and
Cyre of Citys. They allo are faid to have hid, or kept themfelves
secret in the Houtes, as well as the Penates Which Tibullus aftirms,
laving, that thy have not only the Cure of particular Houses, but als
of the ihele Town.
The Ancients ufed to place Dogs to warch their Idols called Lares;
as being a Creature kind and fawning on the Family, and fierce and
frightful to Strangers. They had the same Opinion of their Lares,
or Hoshold-gods, committing to them the intire Care and Safeguard
of their Families. For this Reafon, fays Plutarch, the Romans repre
sented them as brisk young Men, dreft in Dogs-skins. Ovid attrms,
they were fometimes exhibited in sbort Garments, gather’d up on the left
Shoulder, and coming down under the right, in order to be more free and
bese in their Metion; because, fays he, their Bussness was like that of

the Geii (imeationed before) to inquire narrowly into Mens Aftions, for
the Punishment of the Wicked. The Philolopher Famblicbus relates, that
They were often worshipped on the Reads, and had from Time to Time
Offerings of Wine and Frankincense.
We shall now treat of the Shape of Children, diftinguithing them
into beavenly and earthly.
Pouffin exhibired them too fquab and full for flying, and thofe of
Raphael are generally, chiefly in the Borders of the Hiltories of Pp-
che, too hard and mufculous; wherefore, to find a good Form, we
mult keep a Mledium between both. But Cupids ought not to be re-
prefented to beary as earthly Children, yet as joung as you pleafe.
The earthly, contrarily, mutt have Underffanding, in order to han
dle fomething, and their Bodies to be enlarged according to what they
are to do, or carry. But in reprefenting a Cupid, who is to deliver a
Mefage, I think tis proper to give him Age and Bulk enough to do
the Buliness punctually, and the better to express Truth and Nature.
As to their Wings, they muft not be made in Proportion to the Weight
of their Bodies, like Birds; for their Bodies wave of themfelves, and
the Bignels of the Wings often creates Deformity, unlets they are to
reprefent a Fome, when they ought to be larger.
As to the Loves or Cupids themfelves, they, according to my p-
preheation, differ as much in Size as Action. The one is, by the Po-
ets, called Cupid, and the other Anteros. The former creates Love
and Defire for Voluptuousness, and the latter leads to Firtues, Arts and
Sciences. They have both a like beautiful and agreeable Aspect ac-
cording to their Ages. Cupid is reprefented about 6 or 8 Vears old,
and quite naked, armed with a Bow and Arrows, and fomerimes hold
ing a burning Torch. Anteros, contrarily, has a purple Garment,
with bare Arms and Legs only, a Crown of Lawrel about his Head,
2 burning Torch in his Hand, Sandals on his Feet, and he is about
12or 14 Years of Age. Capid is wild and frolicklome, Anteres fo
date and contemplative.
There is another lets Kind of Cupids, fomewhat younger and more
timple than the former. Thefe increase Lave, incite the Pleasure of Vo-
lupiueufness, or mere strongly delude the Senfes. To them, in order to
thew their Simplicity, are alcribed childith and idle Actions, fuch as
Dancing, Shiping about, Running, Rolling, Flying, Kinging Apples at
each other, Coc. They mult not have Quivers, Bows, Arrows, or
Torches, but Baskets of Fruit and Flowers, or Chaplets, a Looking.
glals, or any thing tending to the Pleafures of Vinus.

Alxlder, Propertius, Phileffratus, Claudianus, Silius Italious,

only respect the Charms and Service of Venus, but alfo imply the
Defires and Tendencies of the Heart; fince all Men do not affect the
Same Object, but each chufes for himself.
We regrefent Capid or Love in the Form of a little Child, becaute
is fortih to betake to Venery; for the Actions and Speeches of thofe
in Love are as imperfet as thofe of little Children; as Virgil hews

ence. The Arrows are likewife an Emblem of Love, which, like

ful Iffue of being captivated by the amorous Glances of a beautiful
Woman, and, thro' their fiery Paffions, been led into great Troubles:

F all the Perfections of human Nature, Religion is the mot
excellent and moft univerfal; wherefore all Nations partake of
it in their Manner of Living and Service. And as Reafon principally dit
Kinguithes Man from Bearts, fo we any where fee, that the Vle of it
binds Men to fome religious Ducies; as attending human Underftand
ing, and, according to Jamblichus, a Platonic Seltary, exciting it by 2
narural Defire and Propenfity to do Good and thun Evil. To which
some allude by the celeftial Fire in the Fable of Prometheus, with which
he animated the fird Man; thereby fignifying, that as the Soul is go
verned by Religion, to our Actions mult chiefly tend to implore a
Bletting on them, and our Eyes and Hands be lifted up to Heaven;
knowing, that all Good proceeds from the invifible Giver of all things,
and we ought thankfully to receive it, to his Honour and Glory. We

shall therefore, in order to be both delightful and ufeful, thew from
Antiquity, how and in what Manner divers Nations, not enlightened
by the Golpel, have dedicated their Worship, under Fictions and Fa-
bles, to the invisible Being; and begin with the Exyptians.
The Cultom of thefe People was, when any Perfon prayed to the
Gods, that he mult, as the moft decent Action, do it panding, and with
lifted up Hands. Which Pofture was alfo firictly obferved by the
Romans in their religious Worthip, as Martial and Horace teftify.
Virgil likewife thews, that flanding with Hands lifred up lignities Wor-
ship; when he introduces Anchifes (at the miraculous Sight of 74-
lss Head, encompafted with a thining Light, and yet his Hair unhurt
by the Flame) joyfully turning his Eyes to Heaven, and lifting his

Hands in Prayer to Tupiter: And, in Confirmation of the Acceptable.
nets thereof, a loud Thunder was foon after heard, and a Star appear-
ed in the Heavens when dark, which, like a Torch, with a long clear
Tail, defcending towards the Houle, glid along, and at laft hid in the
Wood of Mount Ida, leaving behind a long light Stripe which emit-
ted a fulphureous Vapour and Smoke: Whereupon Anchises, panding
4p, invokes the Gods, and facred Stars. Philo fays, that the erect
fanding Pofture denores an humble Heart wholly devoring itfelf to
Heaven. Authors unanimoutly agree, that the Ancients offered their
Sacrifices, Vows and Prayers to Tupiter in a flanding Pesture; but to
the Goddess Ops, in a fitting one; fignifying thereby, that the was the
Mother of the Earth. Pythagoras enjoins thofe who pray, to do it
fitting: Xet Plutarch fays, that Numa Pompilins was the Author of
that Vows and Prayers ought to be
that Cultom; thereby teaching,
certain and conflant.
Randing, St. Paul feems to exhort
As to the Pofture of praying

the Pricks did, in their Prayers, pretch out their Hands to Heaven. In
the Book of Judges, Chap. vii. we read, that in Gideons Army, the
Men who bowed down on their Knees to drink, were, by Gods
Command, fent away; but thofe who drank panding, putting their
Hands to their Mouths, were cholen, and defeared the Midianites:
in Exed. Chap. xvii. is written, that as long as Moses beld up. bis
Hands, Amalck was ditcomfted: Which, as Adamantius fays, figni-
fee, that he offered up to God his Actions and Enterprizes, not like
creeping Animals who cleave to the Earth, but as directing his Heart
and Tboughts to Heaven. On which Grounds and Examples, the Coun-
cit of Nice ordained Prayer to be made standing.

Adoration, fays Pliny, not only contifts in lifting up the Hands to
Hestes, but allo in their being open, infide upwards, as if we gave
them to kiss. They who adore and fupplicate, fays Hieronymus, are
uted to tiss the Hands: Wherefore the Hebrexs judged this Manner
of Kiffing to be very reverential, and firictly obferved it. Cj.
cere and Catalius allo confirm the Signification of lifting up or pretch-
ing out boto the Hands to Heaven. Terrullian, (peaking of praying
for the Prefervation and Profperiry of the Emperor, fays thus: Tbe
Chrizians barch:ated ift up their Hands, with their Eyes to Heaven in
token of Innecence; fignissing thereby, that they had no Occasion to be
afpamed, but heartih prayed for their Emperor. The Tuscans likewife,
in their Prayers, vicd fuch a Pofture or pretching out the Hands; and
in adoring their Gods, elpecially Tupiter, lifted up their Hands to
Herten. Of which Ingif alto makes mention in his yth Eneid, where
he defcribes Yartas among the Statues and Allars of the Gods, iff.
ing 4f tis Hands to Heaven, humbly and earneltly imploring Tupiter.
He read further, that in the Olympic Games, anciently celebrated at
Syrnl, 2 ridiculous and ignorant Actor was reproved by the Sophill
Polemon, for his awkward Motions with Hands reverfed; becaute when
he was to lay — Op Tupiter 1 — he rurned his Hands downwards,
and in faying —Ob Earth) — he looked up to Heaven. But
thefe perverle Geftures, proceeding from ancient Cultoms, are still feen
among the Remish Clergy, who, as oicen as they pronounce the Word
Gidor Lird, give the Bletting to the Congregation; and in praying for
the Proiperity of the People, tretch our their Hands on high. in the
Medal of Gordiarus Pins, we fee a small Figure with the Arms thus
extended, and the Hands open, with a Motto alluding to the Matter,

They uled to reprefent the Deity in an hieroglyphick Manner by a
Circke: And, agreeable thereto, the Philofopher Pythageras enjoined 2
turning round in the doration of the Gods. Afernous fays allo,
that he gathered from the Greef Writings, that they had an ancient
Cuffom of running round the Allars when they offered Sacritice, be
ginning from the left to the right side, according to the Zodiac, and
then running from right to left. Plstarch thinks, this was done in 1.
mitation of the heavenly Motions in their continual Rotation, which
Mortals ought to follow. Tho' others pretend, that thereby was

Propertins, in his rii Book, accolts his Miflrels,  I have often
furn’d roand before yeur Door, and offered up to you my Soul and my Pray-
ers. Like which, there is a Paffage in Suctoniss, when he speaks of
the Anceffors of Vitellins, — He had, fays he, a particular Ad-
dress for Flattery, and was the firft who commanded divine Worship
to be paid to Carus Cafar: And no Perfon durft, after his Recurn from
Syris, appear in his Prefence without being covered, and turning fe-
veral times round, with the Face downwards. Numa Pompilius or-
dained, that Men should turn feveral times round, in Prayer to Hea-
ven, and afterwards fit down; thereby incimating, that, in wordly
Affairs, Mortals muff expect nothing but inconflancy and continual
Change, which they ought to bear with Parience and Refolution.
Add to this what Pliny fays; that the Manner of turning round in
Prayer was from the left to the right Hand, in Imication of the
Earth; which, according to him and others, turns on its Axis affer
that Manner. Hiffories inform us, that as Camillus, in Prayer, turn
ed round, according to the Roman Cultom, he fuddenly fell. By which
Accident the People (much addicted to Superflition) would needs pre-
lage his Rum, which happened foon after. We read allo, that Mar-
collus, being at War with the Tranfalpine Ganls, and come to a Town
called Capide, in order to charge them, his Horfe, attrighted by the
Shouts of the Enemy, went backwards; wherefore, to encourage his
Men, he turned him round as if he were adoring the Sun, according
to the Reman Cuftom before Bstcle, and thus covered the Accident
without the People's perceiving it.
We shall now, for the Readers greater Satisfaction, treat of Piety,
and what relates to it.
The Ancients chiefly effcemed the Allar as an Hicroglyphic of Pis
ety, offering, according to their Opinion, their Prayers to the Gods
by means of Fire; which being suppoted a Medium between heaven-
ly and human Things, they pretended it to be a Mediator or Mefien-
ger. Accordingly Virgil, in his 12th Eneid, — I touch the Altar,
and call the Fire upon it and the Gods to witness, &cc. They urge fur-
ther, that Fire unites with material Parts, and always rifes upwards
from below; as knowing all our carchly Actions, and imparting them.
to the heavenly Spirits. Hence we fee, that the Manners of offering
Sacrifices are not without fome Foundation in Reafon, becaute the
Laws of Nature were always purely oblerved. And fince the World
has been enlightened with the Truck, Fire is cultomarily ufed in divine
Service, and no Sacrifice was thought acceptable without it. Indeed,
if

if earthly tirestures can in anywife reconcile us to Heaven, nothing has
W
 with the Spirit than Fire, as it lights and clears
greater&
every thing. Wherefore they think, they may reprefent the Genii

We offer Prayers and Supplications either in making Vows or fe
ceiving Favours in confequence of them. Hence proceed the various
Inscriptions on Medals; which nevercheless do all allude to Piety,
whether in praying for Help or returning Thanks. Accordingly we
find in the Medal of Juls Pia Aug. a Woman tucking up her Gar-
ment on the left Side, and offering with the right; with this in
Scription VOTA PUBLICA. But in one of Hadrianus are two Fr
sures, one like the Emperor, and the other holds in the lefe Hand a

The Alcars were ancienly, as they are now -a -days, Places of
Safety and Protection. Wherefore Priamus, in Virgil, having loft all
Hope of Prefervation, took Sanctuary at the ltar; of which his
Wife had said, — This Altar shall proteft us all. Cicero, (peaking
of the ACfor Refcins, (avs, — We run into his House as to an Altar.

of the State of Greece, takes Vefta for an Emblem of Refage

to the Altar: When Theramenes, fays he, had heard the Things, be
took to Velta for Resuge. Pollux calls Fefa the Alfar of Offering;
especially that at the t Pritancum, where the everlalling Fire was
Kept. Disnytus Halicarnaffus fays, that Romulus buile a Temple in
Honour of Peta, and as a Memorial of his having divided the Ro-
man People into z0 Wards. Suctonins writes almoft the fame in the
Life of Tiberins.
in fine, the Allars were fet up for Sacrifices and Prayer, to obtain
divine Favour and Bleffing; tho' few have determind, which of the
various Sacrifices was beft and moft approv’d by the Ancients; who of
ford to the Almighty only in Spirit and Underftanding, without ut-
tering a Word. Wherefore the Egyptians honour’d the Crocodile, as
having no Tongue, applying it to the divine Silence. They praifed
the Spirits and Souls of the Everbleffed; and offer’d to heavenly
Things material ones, fuch as had some Affinity with them, viz. Fire
to the Sun, Coc. But to the evil Spirits, or Devils, they brought Of-
ferings that they might not hurt or obtlruet them, or that their Un-
cleannels might not pollute the Sacrifice, or the Savour of the Meat.
The 4 Egrptians always thought it abominable to expiate with the
Blood of Animals, and therefore offer’d only Prayers and Frankin-
cente. The Kings of the Protemaic Line enjoyn’d them Sacrifices to
Serapis and Saturn, to whom they built Temples without their
Towns, wherein to offer Beafts, as whual; tho', in after Times, ac-
cording to the inhuman Cultom of Bufris, on his ulurping the
Countries and Places bordering on the Nife, they offer’d Men.
But of Offerings we shall treat further in the following Chapter.

From which Alfar, St. Parl took Occafion to preach to powerful a

We mult conclude, that to many Allars required many Prielts; who
27
were as deterent in Dres as the Gods and Manner of Offering; thote
of Tufiter not at all like Priapuss, nor Diana's thofe of Bacchus,
as we thall thew in the Sequel.
The great Laver of the foxs evidences, that their Priefts obferved


a perfet Clea..s in their Worthip. Even the Almighty himfelf
ordered dois to par off his Shoes, when he appear’d to him in the
burning Buth, and that any Beaff or Man who touched the Mount
or its Borders, to long as he was prefent, should be thot or
Roned.
It is not probable, that the Heathens were to nice in this Point;
neverthelets, the prefent Cuftom induces us to believe, that their An
celtors no lets obferved this Decency in their Worhip; fince, to this
Day, even Chriflians are not allowed to enter the Mofques of the Ma-
fometons; tho' of all intidels they are the leaft Obfervers of religious
Ceremonies.
I think it amiss to deride the Eggptians in particular, for paying
divine Honour to fome Bealts; becaufe molt Nations, especially the
Greeks, (who excell’d in Wifdom and Knowledge) as likewife the hrill
Romans were infected with the lame Superftition.
Alarrobins writes, that King Junus was the firft who introduced and
chabliked in Iraty the Offerings to the Gods; and that he himself was
afterwards worhipp’d as fuch, even to much, that the ancient Romans
never facrificed before they had invoked him as the inventor and Pro-
rector of the Ofterings; for they believed, he always fat at the Gates
of Heaven, and that the Prayers of Mortals could not reach the Gods
if he denied them Entrance, nay, he muft even lend them an Hland
to go forward, becaule Prayers, which Hemer calls Women, are lame
and Cripples.
The moll ancient Nations who brought Offerings (of which the
Eggzrrans were doubilets the principal) did not make ufe of Bealts,

want of Fruits) and this on an Opinion of Pythagoras, who forbad
the Eating of Meat or Blood, as judging that the Soul had its Reb-
dence theren: Alcho’ Eufebins relates, the ancient Divines maintained,
that no Beafts, even no Meal, Honey, Fruits or Flowers, ought to
be offered; for, favs he, God knows them who fear him, and savoura-
bly accepts the poored Leaf they lay on the Altar regerding their Hlearts
and Inclinations, and not what they offer with their Hlands.
tescertain, that, in old Times, a deceltable Cultom prevailed amongal-
moft all Nations, of burchering Men for Victims; as, we learn from cre-
dible Authors, was practifed to Diana Taurics. And not only the an
cient Scythians, but allo the Egeptians and Romans were infelted with
this Crueky; the former offering fuch Villims in Honour to June, and
the latter to Tupiter called Latiahs, whom they eftcemed the Pro-
teltor of the Latins. Sicinnius Dentatus, (or the footh’d, as being to
born) very famous for martial Exploits, was the firll among the Ro-
mans who facrificed Men to Mars. Athanassus relates, that divers o-
ther Nations, after their Return from Conquelt, had a Cultom of di-
viding their Prifoners inco Hundreds, and that one our of each, as the
unlucky Lot fell, was facrificed to Mars. Varre alfo reffifies, that the
wandering Trojans, on their Arrival ar laft in Faly, offered, accord-
ing to the Oracle, one Mian in ten to Plato and Saturn. Enaas, as.
Virgil informs us, chose eight young Gallants out of the Prisoners be
took of the Enemy, to facrifice them to the Gods of Hell for the sake of
Pallas deceased. Diederus Siculus mentions, that the People of Car-
thage facrificed to an Idol of Metal, reprefenting Saturn, holding our
iis Arms bent, young Men as a Burnt-offering, by confuming them
alive in the Flames of a red hof Oven placed under this Figure. Which
Offerings were long retained among thole People, vill ac lafl, having
them in Abhorrence, they put a live Deer to the same Ufe: Ver,
some Time after the Death of flexunder the Great, on being vifited
with the Plague, and the Town clofely belieged, and reduced to Fa.
mine by Agathocles, King of Sirity, they, according to the common
Cultom of Nations, had recourfe to their imagined Turclargods;
Prayers, and old Superflitions, believing, that Suturn, provoked by
the Change of Offering, (which their Anceltors, with great Devotion,
appropriated to him) had, as a Punishment, caufed this Difaffer and
irreparable Damage to befal them: Which Opinion fo infinenced on

all other Nations in that unnatural Practice; infomuch, that in a fran¬

Sararn, they lacrificed their own Children; and afterwards, abating
that Cruelr, they made ufe of thofe of other Men, whom they fe-

that Gelez, King of Sicily, having vanquithed the Carrbaginians in the
Bartle of Hiners, forced them to promife, never more to offer either
their own or other Mens Children in fuch a Manner. Quintus Curti.

preft them. Hercates firft abolithed the killing of Men for a Sacrifice
to Saturn, offering him to many burning Lights in their flead, and
thereby reformed the inhuman Cuftom. This he did on his Return
from Spain; and affigned for Reafon, that the Greek Word gas, (which
the Oracle of Dodone had made ule of for the Inflitution of that So
lemnity) lignified Light, as well as Man, and that therefore they were
to offer to Plato f baked Figures of Clay, and burning Torches or Can-
dles inflead of Men: For which Caufe, they, on the Feffivals of Sy-
tarn, called Saturnalis, made Prefents to one another of little Figures

and burning Wax-candles. But Lycurgus, the Lacedemonian Legillator,
ordained, that Pigs should be ufed for Vicims inflead of Men.
The lmage of Diang, mentioned before, which Iphigenia and Ore-
Hes had brought, bound up in a Bundle of Willow-branches, from Chersonesus
 Taurica, now called Crim, was worshipp’d by the Lacedemeni-

ans with great Reverence. They anciently offered to it Men, who
were cholen by calling the Lot: This cruel Cuftom Lycurgus alrered
thus; they led Vouths to the Alcar of the Idol, and whipped them to
long till, according to their inflitution and the Will of the Oracle, it
was (prinkled with human Blood: And this was done to encourage
young People not to fear the Cuts and Wounds they might receive
from the Enemy in Battle.
Plutarch alfo relaces, that anciently, when the Plague had made 2
fad Havock at Lacedesion, the People were informed by the Oracle,
that the infection would ceafe if they offered yearly fome noble Vir-
gins. The Lacedemonions obeyed. At laft it happened, that the Lot
tell on Helena; who being led for Sacrifice, an Eagle defcended and
fnatch’d the Weapon our of the Prieft's Hand, carrying if over a Field,
where he dropped it on a Heifer. Ariftides, in his 19th Book of the
Nalian State, mentions the fame Accident formerly happening at Rome
to Valeria Luperca.
The Head, fays Hefycbius, Bilhop of Terusulem, as having of all
that is created, Reafon, is called Understanding, and has planted its Seat
in the Heart. God alto formerly commanded, that the Head and Li-
ver, and all that belonged to it, should be a Burnt offering to him:
For from the Heart and the Liver come forth the Springs and Moti-
ons of our carnal Appetites. And in this Senfe St. Punf bleffes his
Congregation, laying, — The Peace of God, which pafes all Un-
derflanding, keep your Hearts and Minds, &cc. The Prophet Iaiah
lays likewife, the whole Head is fick, and the whole Heart jaint: From
the Sole of the Foot even unto the Head, there is no Soundness in it.
Heredotus writes, that the Scythians worthipp’d divers Gods, but
did not erelt either Temples, Allars or lmages, other than to Mlars,
altho' their Manner of Sacrifice was one and the fame to all their Gods;
and which I think not improper to mention here. The Victim be
ing brought to the appointed Place, with its Fore-legs ried, the Prieff
followed, ftriking it on the Head; which cauting it to fink, they there-
upon invoked the God to whom it was to be offered. Then he threw
a Rope about its Neck and Rrangled it, and pulling the Skin and Fleth
from the Bones, he put the fame, if they had no Wood, on the Bones
with

with other burning Mixtures, in order to boil it; and if they wanted
the Skin again, and
the necellary Kettles, they pur the Fleth into
ths broiled it on the Fire. This being done, the Prieft offered the
Victim to the God they incended But among all their Villims the
Horle was the chief, which therefore they dedicated to Mars; whose
Temple, when damaged and decayed by Rains, Dampness and a bad
Clmare, they recrieved in the following Manner. They gathered
many Branches, Twigz, and Chips of Trees, piling them into a large
Square Heap, made perpendicular on three Sides, and floping on the
fourth, to as conveniently to step on: In the middle of this Heap,
they laid a large Knife, not unlike the prefent Persan or Turkis Sei
mitars, which they imagined to be the true imase of Alars, whom
ther motily worshipp’d and honoured with their Offerings.
That the Hone was anciently firll facriticed to Alars, the Hiffories
of the Grects and Romins plainly evince. The Annals of the latter
tenity, that they uled to offer yearly to him, in the Campus Rlartins,
on the rath of December, an Horfe which had won the Prize in the
Rece; thereby befeeching the God to favour their warlike Enterpri
2es with Succels. Punusuniss reports, that Tyndurus, Father of Heb.
2d, who was ravithed by Paris and carried to Troy, having determind
the urmot Revenge, aftembled all the Grecian Princes in Conjunttion
with her Confort Menclins, vowing, by the Sacrifice of an Horfe, to re
venge by Sword the Affront put upon him and his Family. Someallo
precend, that the aforelaid Feltival, kept on the 12th of December, has
been celebrared on the rath of October, and that the Name of Octo-
Ser was given to the Horfe appointed for thofe Purpofes. On which
Occation, a great Conrelt one time arole at Rome about the facrificed
Horfes Head; tome infitting to have it on the Capitol, and others, on
2 Tower of the City, called Alumitis. The Solemnities of this Rice
were performed in the following Manner: On the r2th of October,
2
aey led a ne Horte, deckt with Garlands of Greens, intermised
witk Flowers and Loaves of Bread, thro' the Streets and Quarters of

ine Town, and being arrived at the Campas Martins, they there
killed and offered him to Afars, for obtaining Profperity and Fruirful
neis. This was done to befeech the God ro prevent ruinous War; in
which, the Cavalry caules the greateft Damage and Destruction to the
Product of the Field: For it would be abfurd to think, that the Ro
mens, who pretended to be defcended from the Trejans, should offer
the Horfe to lars, after the Greek Manner, and in Conformity to
the Inceation of Tynduras, in order to be revenged of their Anceffors:

wherefore it was only for the Reafon aforelaid. The Lacedemenions.
as Feffus affirms, had allo a Cullom of offering an Horfe yearly on
Mount Taygeras; burning him to Athes for the Wind to featter into
all their Towns, Villages and Diftrilts. And Paufanias mentions,
that the Macedemans facrificed on the fame Mount, an Horfe to the
Sun, in imitation of the Persians. Kenophon afferts the fame in his
Memoirs, when he relates, that they made Curio a Prefent of an Horle
for that Purpofe; knowing it was the Cultom of the Persians to ho
nour the Sun with fuch a Victim. He fays further, that the Sarma-
tans bred Horfes for Sacrifice and Suftenance. The Salentines likewile
offer’d Horfes, and afterwards burnt them, in honour to Tupiter. The
People of Rbodes offer’'d to the Sun a Chariot with four beautiful Hor-
fes, which they drove into the Sea, to be fvallow’d up by the Waves;
believing the Sun ran round the World equipp’d in that Manner. We
read in the heroic Poems of Pbiloffratus, that, in order to overcome
their Enemies, they were obliged to offer to the Sun a white Foal
who had never Known the Bridle or Spur: This was done by the Ad
vice of Patamedes, to buoy up and animate the Greeks, who, at the
Siege of Trey, were firuck with Frights and Fears at the Sight of 2
fudden Eclipfe which then happen’d.
Origines intimates, that the offering a Bullock before the Taberna-
cle, according to the ancient Tewiss Rice, fignified, that ree must Jub-
due all Pride and Haughtiness; and by a Calf, the having overcome the
Weakness of the Flesh.
The Exotians had a Cultom of facrificing to Neprane a Bullock,.
called with them Mucytes, or bellowing; becaufe his Noife has some
Affinity with that of the Billows when violently agirated by the
Winds. The Bullocks, which the Prielts felected for that Deiry, ought
to have dark and black Hair, thereby to fignify the dark Depths of
the Water. Wherefore many think, that the Eagle is called, by the
Latins, Aquilu, from the Word Aqua, as having a dark and blackith
Colour. For the same Reafon, the Sea-gods are ufually reprefented
with brown Complexions, blucith Hair and Garments, and with full
Chells and broad Shoulders, like Bullocks. As to the TuurnLndi, or
Bull-folemnities in ule among the ancient Romans, they were not infli-
tated by them in Honour to eprane, but for the infernal Gods, whom.
they believed were thereby moved to Compaffion, when, under Tar-
quinius Superbus, the City was aftlicted with a Plague, which carried off
Abundance of Women with Child, and the Peopie imputed the Misr
forcune to the eating the Fleth of black Bullocks..

The Sacrifices which the Roman Cenfors uled to offer every fitth
Year for their Purification, and called Solitaurilia, contifted of a Boar,
2 Ram, and a Bull.
The offering a Bullock, as we gather from Hiftory, was generally,
especially among the Romans, a Token of Viltory gained over the
Enemy. Accordingly, Turenal fays, They led to the Capitol a large
black Bullock markel with Chalk. But here it mutt be obferved, that
the Lerdemomans in Come Sort imitated the Romans in leveral of their
Sacrifices of that Nature; for when the latter got a Victory by Slaugh.
ter and taking the Enemy Pritoners, they offer’d a Bullock; bur
when without Bloodthed, a Sheep. The Lacedemonions, contrarily,
facrinced a Bullock, on obtaining a Victory without Cruelty or Blood
thed; and a Cock, when it was got in the open Field, in a pirch’d Bar-
le, preferring Enterprizes performed with Reafon and Conduct, to
thote effected by main Force.
We read likewile, that anciently, especially among the Romans, the
Bullock was to much regarded, that it was as capital to Kill one, as
to murther a Citizen. Wherefore Erichthans, reigning at Athens, or
derd, that ar the yearly Feffival, wherein a Bullock was facrificed, the
Peey, or Prieft (whofe Ducy requir’d him to furnith the Cartle, and
to cut their Throats when knock’d down) should, after the Solemnity
was over, and in Mlaintamance of the Law, fortake the Town and
Territory, firft leaving the Ax at the Foot of the Altar.
The Treffulians were enjoined by the Oracle of Apalle at Dodone, to
offer Sacrifice yearly on the Tomb of Acbilles; and to furnith the Ne.
cefiaries from their own Country; namely, two tame Bulls, one black
and the other white; the Wood from Mount Pelion; the Fire out
of Theffal; and Flower and Water from the River Sperchins. With
thefe were to be ufed Garlands and Feftoons of Greens, intermixd
with Amaranths, that, in cafe the Ships, bringing the Neceffaries
from other Countries, should be kept back by contrary Winds, at leaft
Iuch Greens and Flowers as never wither, might not be wanting to
Lang on the Tomb.
Apollodorus and Attrnaus relate, that Hercules was to great an Eater,
a5 often to devour a whole Bullock at a Meal: For which Reafon, the
Ancients dedicated to him the Water-foul, called by the Greeks pages,
in English Sea-mew; becaule this Bird, according to Suidas, is very
voracions; nay, on account of this Excels in eating, they brought
him Offerings, whereby Men were not allowed to ufe any other Expret
tions than Curting and Swearing. Laftantius and Apellodorys relate the
Story


Cielings, or Plafonds.
Chap. 18.
503
Story thus; Hercules on a Time travelling with some Companions
thro Rbodes, and being very hungry, met with a Country-man at
Plough with a Couple of Oxen, which he defired to purchale for fill-
ing his Belly; but the Man rejecting the Proffer, Hercules took the
Cattle by Force, and with his Companions eat them up. The other,
inrag’d and frantic hereat, curs’d and fwore at Hercules as he was eat-
ing; who laughed and banter’d him, faying, he never eat a better
Morfel, or with more Gufto, in all his Life. Wherefore the Inhabi-
tants of that Ifland erected an Altar to him, after his Deification,
whereon was carved a Yoke of Oxen; offering thereon, at certain
Times, a Couple of Oxen: At which Solemnity the Prielts and Peo-
ple buftled about, and made a great Noife, by curting, fwearing, and
other Impieties, which they thought would pleafe the God, in Re-
membrance of the Adventure with the Plough-man.
Imalt fubjoin another Sacrifice to the Honour and Memory of the
deitied Hercules, not lets foolith than ridiculous. Suidus relares, that
the Exotions on a certain Time leading an Ox for Sacrifice, he broke.
loofe and ran away. Whereupon the Mob; unwilling to pretermit
the Time for Celebration, Ruck an Apple on four Sticks, with two
imaller on top, reprefenting four Legs and two Horns; offering this,.
with great Solemnity, to Hercules. Others afcribe this Apple-facrifice..
intlead of an Ox, to the Athenians: And Tulius Pollax tellifies, that it
was long in ule among the Thebans. Vet Pausanids, in his Memoirs,.
reports, that as the Apple-tree is fometimes accepted by the Gods,.
in token of a propitious Sacriice, to the Beotians, at the Oxs running.
away, offer’d to Hercules an Apple tree, having but four Branches,
intlead of the fourlegged Beaft; whence it became afterwards cultom=
ary to confecrate that Tree to this God. And Apellodorus affirms, ac-
cording to Zenedotus, that thole Offerings of the Beotians were inflead
of Rams and Sheep.
The imploring Help and Favour by means of a Bullock, reminds
me of a Cultom of the ancient Scytbrans, now called Tartars, who
Killing and stripping a Bullock, the Perfon who had received any Injury
from another, took the Skin, (pread it on the Ground, and fac upon it with
his Hands behind him; and thofe who, in palting by, promited to give.
their Alfiffance, trod un the Skin with the right Foot, thereby figaiiving.

Pindirus mentions, that the Hyperborcans performed their = Heca-
tombs, or great Sacrifices, to Apollo with Affes: Wherefore Callima
chus fays, that that God took Delight in the killing a fat Afs.
Bur the Egigrians hated this Creature, not only for his Dulness
and Stupidity, but allo for his Skin mix'd with brown and white;
which they accounted abominable, and untit to be offer’d to the Gods.
Accordingly, they abuted him as much as posfible, finging Stones and
Clods of Dirt and Mud, and pricking him with Charp pointed Sticks;
and when, in the Purfuit, they found him on a convenient Eminence,
they made him roll down it. Hence arifes the comparative Proverb
applied to contemptible Perfons, The 4ss of Egypt.
Thefe People were not the only ones who paid Honour to the Hog:
Other Nations have ranked it with their Gods. For this Creature was
formerly facred in Cantis, where they believ’d, that Tupiter, at his
Birth, luck’d a Sow, which, by her grunting, intirely drownd the
the Cries of the Child; tho' some will rather afcribe this Kindness to
the Goat of Amaltheu.
The ancient Nalian Kings had a Cultom, to offer an Hog in
their nuptial Solemnties: And the Great, in their nuptial Fealts,
brought, according to the Tufcan Manner, an Hog to the Allar, con

 They of Arges celebrated ihe Fellival called Hyfferies, by offering
in Hogtin Hohour to Vehws Of which Copinacbus largely treats;
tho' we find the Sicyonians dedicated to her all Kinds of Bealls, as
Ariffophanes reltities, laying, they kill’d an Hog to offer to Veaus.
They likewife offered an Hog to the Goddels Majs, (by whem is
meant the Earth, thus called; according to Gurnelias Labee; as figaity-
ing Greatness) becaute this Creature makes preat Havock among the
Corn and Grain, and is very prone to tear up the Ground; as Haerace
Tays.—The Hog loves the Mad; for thefe Bealts were facrificed to
the Gods, either on account of their Likenels and Agreement, or Dif
fimilarity and Avertion. Wherefore the Poets mention, that the
Hog was firft offer’d to Gores, for the great Mitchief it did to the
Corn. Veranins fays, they allo offer’d a Sow to Geres, after a Funeral,
for purifying the Family.
On making a Peace, Alliance, or Truce, they offerd an Heg: As
Virgil attums, —He made the Peace during the killing of a Sow.
Though Quintilian and Serviss, in their Remarks, fay, that Virgil
meas an Hog; becaute in that Solemnity was always ufed an Hog or
Rigll Suctemus, in the Life of Claudius Cafar reports, that he made
an Alliance with the Princes, during the Offering of a Sow; tho' Titus
Livins (peaks likewife of an Hog.
The Mosaic Law enjoined the King or Princes to offer for their
Sins ian He-goat; and thofe who had no publick Employments, a
She goat or Lamb. Haren was commanded to offer, for himself and
Family, a Calf, as harmlels or righteous; and an He-goat for a Sin-
offering. And we learn from Hesychins, Bihop of Terufalem, that the
High prieft, after having offer’d an He-goat for a Burne offering, was
allowed to go into the Haly of Holies, cloathed in a whire Linen coar,
with a Girdle of the fame; and Breeches and Micre of fire twined
Linen; as fignifying, that being reconciled to God, purified in Body
and Soul, challe, fober, and righteous, fill’d with godly Underttanding,
and the Gifts of the Holy Spirit, he might enter into that Place.
The offering He goars and Sheep under the Law implies, a morti-
lying; ind rooring fout all impurites and carnal Lulls, as Adamantins
Explains. it, and to which Cyrif agrees; for Scripture, hieroglyphi
cally, commonly rakes the He-goar for Men plung’'d in Rinking, im-
pure, and ill Manner of extravagant Defires; as alfo plainly appears
by our Saioures Words, when, at the latt Judgment, he will let the
Sheep orfElelt, with all Bleffings on his right Hand, and on the Left,
thofe, who, by Rinking Sin, are unworthy of his Pity, for eternal

Punishment And after fuch a Manner the Goat was brought to a-
cone for Sins, when the Law commanded, that he should be prefented
alive before the Alear, and the Priell, laying his Hands on the Head,
should confess over him all the Iniquities of the People, and put them
on the Head of this latcivious Creature, and then, by a fit Perfon,
fend him away into the Wilderness. They add, for Confirmation,
that the thick and rough Hair of this Beaff is laid upon him as a
Kinking Burthen of his Lafcivioulness
The Fables of the Greek Poets tell us, that Hercules was the firtt
who tamed the lafcivious He goat; meaning, that he overcame the
Wanion Defires of the Flcth. He likewife firft offer’d this Beall to
Tano; for, having vanquith’d Hlipperson, and thereby irritated the God.

Junias relates in his third Book. But the Lacedemonians facrificed to
Di:x1, called the Coryrashan, in the Fields, Goats Fleth only, no other
Realf being allowed in that Solemnity. Wherefore Kenophon, in his
Memoirs, reports, that, when the Persions invelled Athens with a
mighty Force, incending to ruin it incirely, the Afbenians made a Vow
to Dians, to offer to her as many Goats as they should defeat Ene-
mies, in cafe they beat them.
The Poets likewife mention, that the Goat was facrificed to Bac-
chas; becaute he, being the God of Wine, could not be more accep
rably honour’d, than with the Death of a Creature to noxious to Vine-
yards dedicated to him. Wherefore the Feltivals called Afrelis were
allo celebrated in his Honour; when they laid on the Ground, at
equal Diltances, Sacks or Bags of Goats Skins fill’d with Wind, which
being fneared with Oyl or Greats, they merrily, to win the Prize,
leap’d from one upon the other, tumbling, by Reafon of the Clib
nets, over each other, to the no small Delight and Applaute of the
People.
The Romon Ladies, on being delivered with Twins, formerly of
ferd to Tase (to whom Empires and Riches were facred) certain
Sheep; which, according to Bebins Mecer, were tied between two Pair
of Lambs on each Side. But the Sicyoniass Cultom was, to offer fat
Sheep, by them called Exmesides, to the Gods of Benevolence and
good Hope, for the good Luck and Profperity of their Families.
They likewife facrificed to Hercales, as God of Riches and Plenty, 2
Sheep tied on four Sticks, inflead of a Bullock, who ran away, as
they were leading him to the Allar; wherefore he is called Metins.

We gather from the Greet and Roman Hiffories and Antiquities.
that they facrificed Dogs, the former to Proferping, and the latter to
Genetia. At the Feltivals called Lupercalis, facred to the Lycaan idol

of Dogs is to purfue Wolves. Others think that this was done in Honour
and Remembrance of Romulys, who, they faid, was, in his infancy.

Evender firft introduced and ektablished thofe Solemniries. The Peo-
ple of Arges offer’d Dogs to the Goddess Cyoig; to whom they a-
scribed the Power of giving Women in Labour an happy Delivery.
The Lacedemenions contecrated thofe Creatures to Mars for their Eager-
nets and Alacrity in falling on Deer: For the young Men in their
warlike Exercifes uled to begin them with facrilicing a litile Dog to
Mars, as the Rrongell and moft valiant of the Gods, judging that
Creature to be the moll acceptable of the came and fociable Ammals.
The Augures, a Sort of Prielts among the Romans, allo often facriticed
a Kind of red Dogs before the Towngate, called from thence Caruta-
ria, or, Dogsgate, that the Heat of the Dog-days in Tuly and
Augist might not bun or fpoil the Trees and Fruits of the
Earth.
The Inhabitants of Metbose annually offerd a Cock for the Prospe-
rity of the Vineyards, and for averting the violent South eall Winds;
for when this Wind rifes in the bloffoming Time of the Vines, its
Malignity kills the young Shoots, and frullraces the Hope of a fucure
Vintage: Wherefore the fugures of that Tract of Land found it
Proper to order, that two young Men, cholen for that Purpofe, should,
at a certain Place; take a white Cock, and each holding a Leg, above
the Spur, by parting, pull him to pieces; and then, with the Piece
of the Cock in their Hands, running round the Vineyards, one to the
Right, the other to the Left, till, having as they thought made an
Aconement, they met again at the Place where the Cock was forn to
pieces, and there buried him. By blind Luck, it fomerimes fell out,
that as long as they obferved the Solemnity, the iffue of Things an
wered their Defire.
The ancient Remans allo uled to facrifice annually an Hen to Escula-
pins, the God of Health.

Dunging: Wherefore, in his Solemnities, they wore on their Hleads
Chaplets of freth Figs, as well on account of their being Food, as
dainty Talle.
The Egygtions offer’d annually, on the iggh Day of the firt
Monch, Honey and Figs, in Honour of Afercury; celebrating this
Feat with great Noife, and crying, Obl how sweet and agreeable is
Trutt.
The ancient Gaals worlhip’d Hercules as the God of Prudence, and,
as Lariamus fays, Eloquence, even more than Afercury; becaute Elo
grence is accounted more confummate in aged Wien (as Hercules is ge
nerally reprefented) than in the Voung: Wherefore they offerd to
him, as the Eggotians did to Afercury, Honey and Figs: Moreover,
all who mmnister’d held a Figiree Branch in their Hands, and they,
as well as the Prielts, had their Heads adorned with Poplar Leaves.
Firgif likewife mentions, that Evander, offering to this God, had a
Chapiet of the fame Leaves about his Head, calling them Hferenks
Lertes. And Macrobins fays, that the ancient Solemnities to Saturn
and Hercules were performed bare headed; but in thofe to other Gods,
the Priefts Heads were cover’d.
The ancient Romans offer’d to the Goddefs Carna, to whom they
atcrib’d the Support of the animal Spirits in hamman Bodies, Bacon, and
the Greens of Beans, whereby Men are made flrong and hearcy for
Labour. And it is certain that thofe People called the firft Day of Tine
Fabaria, or Bean's day, becaute that Oblation was inflituted by Junius
Brarys, of whom this Month has alfo borrowed its Name.
Felas Pompeins fays, that the Romans annually offer’d to Vulcan in
Tune, at the Fealt called the Fithing-games, a Sort of Filh, for the
Souls of Men; becaute the ancient Philofophers hicroglyphically re
prefented the Souls by Fithes: And, as Philo fays, becaute they con
tilt of a pure Element, and God created them the firft of all living
Creatures.

Sicilians, corns; and Flour to Ceres.. The heathenish Prielss offered

God of Riches, or the Productions of the Earth, being the Inventor
of Sowing and Tillage, he is therefore by them repretented with a
Bisket of Fruits of, the Earch on his Head. Fiven, hism Offerings,
whether of Mear, Bread, Fruits, or Flowers, were camied in Baskets
We fee, that the Ing is commonly facred to Offris, not only on ac
count of his being Malter and Inventor of Wine, but allo of all Moif
ture; wherefore he is called Occan, and Ips, Ibetis: For it was the
Cullom to carry a Iug in the Proceltion of the Offerings, thereby to
thew their Veneration for this God, keeping a large one in particular
Elteem; to carry it cover’d, with great Solemnity, to the Temple;
where being arrived, they knceled down, and, with lified up Hands,
thanked the God for his loving Kindness to Men; as believing that all
Things were brought forth by Moiffure.
in a certain Place in Greece they worhipp’d Myngrus God of the
Flies: When the People effer’'d to him, all the Flies recized from thole
Parts. The Cyrencufes in Lybia allo honourd the God of Flies, called
Acber, making Offerings to him for Hopping the Plague, which fome-
times was occationed by the Multitude of thofe Infelts.
Ancrently, they offered red Wine intlead of Blood. For Mlefes, in
his Song in Lextersnomy, fayss. And theu didff drink the part Blood of
the Graps. And David, in his Pfalms, — Tbey have drank the Blood
of the Grape. Indeed, the Egyprian Prielts, fome of whom were Kings,
intirely abftained from Wine, but always uled it in their Offerings,;
not as an Acceptablenels to Heaven, but to fignify the Blood and
Punishment of thofe who rebell’d againff the Gods, and thereby: to
obtain Favour and Reconciliation: For the Egyptians firmly believed,

that Wine Sprang from the Blood of the difcomfted Giants, which,
on their rifing againft the Gods, and threatening to fform Heaven, was
pilt on the Earth, and therefore made Men commit all Manner of

Estravagancies: They: alfo inrimated by the Wine press, Porsecution,

When the Egyptias Prielts, for the Sins of the People, put up
Prayers for averring the Wrath of God, they were drelf in Black, to

was more proper.
It is likewile a general Cuftom of the principal and moft polite Na-
tions to dress in black ar Times of Humiliation, and thofe who mourn

The Black was alfo dedicated to Plaro, and in offering to him the
Priefts were in this Colour; believing, that it beft funced the hellish
or Tubterrancan Gods.
Heredotss, to thew that the Heathens agree with the prefent Opi-
nion touching the Signification of Cleanness, reftifies, that the Egypti-
ans did not allow the wearing in their Temples any Cloaths made of
Wool, but they had whice lnen Garments. Terrullian, (peaking of
our Saviour, therefore lays, as be is dreft in the Garb of white Linen,
it is the same with that of Ouris. And Plutarch, crearing of Ips and
Ofris, takes this to be the Reafon why the Priells make ule only of
whice linen Garments, to lignify, that all clean and undefiled Things
beft agree with the Nature of the Gods, whole pure and facred Ma-
jekly, according to Plate, ought not to be worhipped by Things im
purc and filchy. And as Linen is the cleanelf Drels, and can be very
eafily walhed and made beautiful, fo it was thought the moft becom:.
ing the facerdotal Dignity and Purity. And indeed, the Magi, or
Prielts of the ancient Persiuns faid, that God took Delight in white
Garments: Which Affertion feems to be berrowed from Selomon, who,
in his Exhortations to good and blamelets Manners, and a pure Con=
Kience, lays, —Let your Garments be always white; as if he meant,
- Take heed, in all your Actions, not to be defiled with Evil and
Incleannels.
The Prieftly Vellment called Poderis, from the Greet Word Podes,
in Engliss, Feer, was of fine white Linen, fetting clole to the Body,
and hanging down to the Feet: Ancient Divines fay, that thereby ther
tignitied the most bely and myfterious Dectrine: This was the undermort
Covering as we find in Exed. xxxix. And they made Coats of fine
weav’d Linen, and their Garment called Hypodytes of Hyacinth Co-
lour; intimating Heovenliness, and that Men ought to raife their
Minds, Thoughts, and Faculties thither, forfaking what is earthly.

The Shoes of the Eoiptian Prielts were not made of other Matter
than the Bark of Trees; to caurious were they in avoiding the leaff
Appearance of Unchallity and Uncleanness. Accordingly, and
with respect to Purity, it was a great Crime among. the Roman
Prieffeffes, called Flumisicx, to wear Shoes of Skins of Bealts which
died narural Deachs, fuperflitioutly behieving it to be abominable; but
ther approved of luch as were made of offer’d Bealts Skins. Our Sa
viour himself commanded his Dilciples not to wear Shoes; that, be
ing with all speed to publith everlatting Life, they might intirely for-
Lake what is corruptible. Moses allo, leaving the Egyprian Bondage,
wore Shoes of Bealts Skins, intimaring his Affinity with Mortality;
but afterwards, as he grew in Strength and Virtue, and was to ferve
the Almightr, he was commanded to pull them off.
The Egyption Priefts adorned their Heads with Hawk's Feathers;
thinking to owe this Honour to that Bird, becaufe, as they fay, he
formerly brought the Prielts of Thebes, in Eorpt, a Book written in
red Lerters; containing the Manners of worshipping the Gods, and
many of the principal Rires to be obferved in their Offerings; where.
fore, the Lotn Poets, according to Martial, call thofe Prietts copped
or crefted.
II would be needless to fay more touching the facred Droffes, fuch
as the Micre, Bonnet, Ephod, and other Ornaments, fince they, and
every Thing elfe relating to the Prieithood, are amply defcrib’d by
Gserce in his Fewish Anuquities Wherefore, after having touched on
the Hair of the Priefts, we shall only rrear of the ancient Roman

Priethord
It was formerly the greateft Scandal and Indignity foial Manto
have his Hair cur off. And poffibly Alofes therefore commanded the
Priefts not to have their Beards or Hair taken off with a Razor, but
clipped with Sciffors, to diffinguith them from thote of the Egypti-
ans. who, after the Deach of Apis, deitied and worthipped by them,
had not only their Heads, but their whole Bodres shavedgi that in their
Sacrifices they might be purc. Morcover, according to Bede, in his
Church-hiffory, by thaving the Head is meant a renouncing fuperfiuous
Riches (which Priefts, by their Inditution, are punctually to obferve)
and that Hair is to he accounted but as a Superfiity of the Body.
And in this Senfe lpeaks thieronymas, that as the Priett ihas: his Head
inaved, to he ought allo to cur and caff off fuperfluous Riches and

carthly Defires; and that by the litile Hair left is fignified, that they
muft be content with fmall Provifion for fupporting their mortal Bo-
dies. Others add, that the little Hair left on their Heads, in the Form
of a Crown, denotes the Crown of Eternity, with which, after their
Conflicts, they were to be rewarded
But as for the Law commanding to cut the Hair round, and to
have the Beard, many think it proceeded from the abominable Abute
of the Heathens, who offer’d their own Hlair, and that of their Chil-
dren, to the Devil.
On the other hand, divers Councils decreed, that the Priefts, in Imi-
tation of the Nazarites, should keep their Hlair and Beards, and let
them grow; with Intention, that, by feeing and handling the fame,
they might always remember their Ducies. Wherefore they did not
have, but clip their Hair with Sciffors, that it might not over- grow.
But to returnn to the Romans.
Nama Pompilins, their fecond King and a Prielt, when he could
no longer alone bear the Weight of the Government, and ditcharge
the Duries of the Priekhood, infficuted three Prielts called Fiamines;
the firft, in honour to Tupiter Capitelinus; the second, to Mars; and
the third, to Romulus Quirinus. Their Dress was much like that of
the prefent Romiss Clergy in their Service. On their Heads they had
a white Hat, with an Olive-(prig upon it, at the Excremity whereof
appeard a Tuft of Wool, taken from a facrificed Sheep: This Hat
Was called Albegalerus.
Aferwards Numa ordained twelve other Priefts, called Sohi, in
Honorr to Mars the Genquerer Pretefter, Avenger, and Peace-maker.
Thefe were dreft in long loofe Garments or Coats, having a Breaft-
Piece of Copper enrich’d with Gold, Silver, and divers precious
Stones. The Solemnities growing numerous, and at length amourting
to above 20,000, Nung increafed the Number of Priefts accordingly.
He created the Feciales, and Pater Patratus, who proclaimed War;
alto the Epulones, or Overfeers of all facred Banquets, and Augures,
of Soothfayers, whole Authority was to great, that the Senate could
not affemble without their Confent. They had all particular Garbs,
except when they officiated, at which Time their Drets was alike,
Deing a Garment of white Linnen, very wide, and reaching to their
Heels, girt with a Girdle and Buckle about their Bodies. This Gar-
ment they called Gabinus.

Aachiles timself gives the dejetted Touth Achemenides the right Hand,
as a Tokin of his Sincerity to him. — And in another Place, Amata
favs to Latinas— Where is your Sincerity? Where the former Care

cordng to Servis, that Sinceriry is moft found in old People, who
are grey and whice Horace, complaining of the Wickedness of his
own Times, fays, that Sincerity dreffed in White is little worlhipp’d:
Adding, that, in the Offerings to it, the High-prieff keeps not only
the right Hand covered with the white Garment, but allo his Head
and almoft his whole Body; to thew, that the Heart and Will ought
to be pure and immaculate, and always to accompany Sincerity.
Therefore Arigto alfo lays, Sincerity was formerly reprefented in

Perrents reports, that Aums himself, for a Badge of Prielhood,
wore a small Linnen cap, like the Priefts and Soothlayers in their Ser
vices; as did likewife the Wives and Maidfervants of the Reman
Prielts, called Flamines.
The Hat allo, among the ancient Romons, denoted the facerdotal
Dignity; for the Fhinines took their Names from Pilens or Hat, as if
they would fay, Pileanines Tho' others are of Opinion, their Name
is derived from Fhimmenm, which, among them, was an Headorna-
ment; for the Bilhop-like Caps, long Coats and Garments were, asl
have faid, peculiar to the Priefls. The Authority and Credit of the
illuftrious Fabins Pictor induce us to believe this, when he fays, that
the Priefts, or Flamines, were not allowed to appear publickly with
out the Har or Cap; but that in their Houles they were at their own
Liberty. A Cultom to this Day sirictly obferved in many Places by
the Romish Prelates.

When the Vefal Virgins offered, they wele dreft in a long and wide
Vellment of very fine whice Linnen, called Suffibulum. Their Heads
were likewife wound with a whice Garment, and over it was a Vail of
whice Linmen hanging down square, and coming over their Cheeks,
and faltened under the Chin with a Clafp or Buckle; wherefore they
were called Veftals, from the Word Veffis. The Romiss Women wear
to this Day long Vails, pretending to imitate the virtuous ancient Ma-
trons, who covered their Heads, Necks, and Breafts with them, and
kept themfelves to chaffe and referved, as never to feparate from their
Husbands, nor give the leaff Opportunity for Evil.
Befides the before-mentioned Dreffes, the Priells had divers imple
meats, and facred Velfels for Offerings, viz.
Prefericulum, a Veffel of Brafs, wide on top, and without an Handle.

her right Legon a squere Plinth, and the left on a globu
far Body. Her Garment is light grey, faltened above the
Knee with a Button, and tuck’d up behind. Before, the
ers has a Sheeps-ffeece ried about her Waille. Her Sleeves are
turned up above the Elbows. On her left Arm she holds
the Figure of DECORUM; and in that Hand, a Chizel, Pair of
Compaffes, Line, and Square; and in the other, a Maller. Her Locks

contills in the Symmetry or exact Divifion of the Objects, according to
their particular Qualities, especially in the human Figare (wherein it
moll excels) and next, in Quadrupeds; all Relieved and conformable to
the Life.
ies other Performance concerns the Bassrelief, or half round
Work, according to its different Qualities; as we shall hereafter ex-
plain.
The Materials for Statuary are of five Sorts, and each of a particu-
her Narure and Quality.
The firk is Clay.
The second, Wax.
Thethird, Wood.
The fourth, Ivory.
The fitth, Stone.
The two firfl are worked with wooden Tools, and the reft with
harp lrons, and each Material requires a particular Handling. From
the firft, fomething is taken of; to the second, fomething is added; in
the third, is cutting; in the fourth, scraping; and in the latt, driving
or thrulting, according to the Nature of the Matter, either foff or
hard, folid, dry, or briitle.
In an human Figure or other Creature, Statuary firtt sketches its
Thoughts on Paper, making choice of the moft beautiful Side; and then
takes Clay, and fets thofe Conceptions upright, and as like the Delign as
poltible. The Figure being now roughed out with the proper Tools, or
rather with the Fingers, the Life is fet to the fame Pofture, in order

The Work, flanding in this Condition for some Time to dry, is after-
wards baked in an Oven, and then may ferve as a Model for carving in
Marbleor other Matter,
The Efience of this Art lies in a beautiful Ferm, and a neat or diffintt
Representation of the Things we would make, whether haman Figures,
Bezts or other Objects; of which, the principal are Figures and Bass-
relicts.

the tecond respects the Horfe, Camel, Elephant, Lyon and other
Bealls. And
The laff regards the Peacock, Eagle, Raven, Oul and other fuch
Creatures occurring in this Art; all requiring an exact Knowledge.
seeing therefore that to many Thingsare necelfary to be underflood,
I think it of the laff Contequence, that the Arciff, before he begin
Sculpture, be well acquainted with the Groands of Drawing; and for
Two Realons; Firft, in hopes of Honour and dvantage; and Second.
I, For Fear of Prejudice and Reproach. Thefe two Confiderations
alwars artend the Marter, and one of them unavoidably depends on
Ks Knowledge and Performance. For as the Work is of great Con
tequence and Charge, as well in the Materialsas Tools, and flow Pro
cets; to, if it fucceed well, it brings Reputation and Gain, otherwife,
greater Loss and Blame.
A true Artiff ought not to be without the following Works, viz.
The Starnes of Perrier, the Lcenelogy of Cxlar Ripa, Oudaan's Roman
Alght, and other Books of Aniquities; allo the principal Hiffories,
but chiely, Les Characteres des Passions, by Montieur de la Chambre,
and other Anshors on the fame Subject; together with thofe of Droses,
and of Begts and other Anmmals. And for Practice, he ought to be
furnished with Plsiper-figures, Bass-reliefs, Medals, Bufts, Hands and
Feet, Lions and Lieneffes, Sphinxss, Terms, and many other Things,
which are to be bought; as likewife, Models of Wax and Clay, and

C H. AP. III.. Of Bassrehess.
HAT I may proceed in an orderly Manner, I thall begin with
Bass reliefr of which there are three Sorts, viz. almost Relief,
half Relief, and faint, or fat: And the Difference of thefe ought to
be well confider’d, as they have three particular Inteations in their
Proportions or Divifions.
The frtt Sort; or almoff Relief, is commonly uted in deep Nicbes,
with Figures in full Proportion; having three Grounds behind one an
other; the foremolt Figures are almost Relief, the second balf Relief,
and the third somewhat less.
The fecond Sort, or balf Relief; is uted in shallew: squarl Niches,
Frentifpieces, circulan-beaded Upper-doers, and Niches. This has two
Grounds or Depths; the frlt is balf Relief, and the second Jomowbat
Jainter.
The third Sort is proper for Frizes, Pedestals, Balluffrades, and Me-
dals. This has but ons Deptb, or a fingle Figure on one Ground.
In their Ordonnance, four Things are to be obterved.
1. That the principal Figare of the Work have its full Relief, and
thole of the leaft Contequence most faim, and Ricking to the
Ground.
2. That the greateff Motion and Action of the Figures be always in
prople, yet without any forethortening of the Members.
3. That ther Setting on of the projelting Parts appear natural, not

forced.

4 That the Work be equally divided and diftributed every where
alike, not too fall in one Part, and too empty in another; which is a
Point of great Importance.
Altho’ thefe Bass-reliets feem chiefly to concern Statuaries, yet they
as much affeet Painting, on account of the particular Relation the two
Arts have to each other, in that one cannot be perfect without the
other. The Statuary borrows from the Painter the Ordonnance or Dif
polition for the Ground of his Work, which he afterwards puts in
Praltice: The Painter, on the other hand, learns of the Statuary the
Method of modelling, as neceffarily ferving for a Foundation in the
Pexformance of Balsrelief. Wherefore, I think a Painter cannot pot

fibly paint a good one, unless he underfland fomething of modelling;
nor a good Statuary give Sacisfaltion, without having some Skill in
Painting.
A judicious Mafter ought to be exalt in ordering thefe Batsreliess,
that exch receiving its preper Light, all may appear diffintt, and with-
out the leaft Alteration. Sun-ine or parg Sbades make Things look
otherwife than they really are, by the mishapen Ground hades which
on thofe Occafions are feen in Nature; when the Work, being much
raifed, has many deep Hollows.
A large and aniverfal Light is moll advantageous for the firf Sorr,
or almost Relief.
A Light fontewbat mere fram the Side is most proper for the fecond,
or balf Ketief; becaute it has but few Kilings, and the Work is there.
fore more free from Ground (hades. And
A direct Side-light is bett for the third or fainter Sort, as giving it
great Deceram and Eleganct, tho' it be almoff without Shade.
This Deltrine, touching the Light, may poffibly feem ftrange to some,
viz that it ought to be governed by the Bass-reliefs or Piltures which
are to fland or hang in it, according as they are more or lets relieved:
But we muft conceive, that a proper Light ought to be chofen for each
Sort of Bassrelief, from this Confideration; that the Light is not
equally good exery where: Here, fairs a Batsrelief in a deep Niche;
there, one less rifing, and here again, one that is quite flat; the one
being thus lighted from a side, and the other fronting. Nevertheless,
it must not be thought, that according to the Make of the Room, the
Difpolition of the Windows, and the Places fix’d for a Niche on each
Side of the Chimney, is in our Choice to have in one of thofe
a Batsrelief of three Grounds, and in the other,, one of two Grounds,
or one; becaute that which is neareft to the Windows receives a more
froming Light than the other: Wherefore, they ought to be alike
hollow and raifed By a proper Ligbt, we mean, that the Work
mult be to order’d, that each Part, according to its Light, get 2 good
Decorum: For Inflance, in the formor Niche, where the Figures are
much raifed, they cannot give fuch large Ground-fhades; fince the
Light falls on them a little froncing, but may happen in the other,
where the Light comes more from the Side; unless you placed the Fi
gures which in one Niche are on the right Side, in the offer of the
tek, thereby to, prevet the fuperfirous Shades, and eleganly recon
cile the Difference of the Lights.

deflals; and Medals.
Many err in placing Batsreliefs in Frizes of Chimseys, on Pedeltals
and over Room-doors, even upon the Breaft-work of the Chimney it
self, fetting there more than half relieved, nay, whole relieved Fi-
gures; as 1 once law an almost Relief on a single Groand in a Chimncy-
trize. In my Opinion, tis very improper to make Figures of nine
Inches Leagth to very diftant from each other, and to litle draperied;
Cfometimes a Figure has fcarce three or four Folds) the Work look-
ins then (to (peak in painter like Terms) more like a fmooth Dead
colouring, or rather old and wore out, than new made; and should
by right be execured as faint and fine again. I have obferved, that
Painters, in reprefenting Bals-reliels in luch Places, avoid all large
Shades as much as poffible, especially in Frizes, Pedeltals, and other
Flats; it being, in my Opinion, very proper that thofe Parts of the
Archtecture keep their Flarness; and as all the Ornaments, viz. Capi-
tals, Foliage, Modillions, Triglyphs, and the like, are in fuch Cafe
commonly perform’d neat and curious, to our Figures ought likewife
to be perfectly finithed.
Some keep too much to the great Manner But the fmaller the
Things are, especially withindeers and near the neater they muft be:
Forwithout-deers the Cafe is different, becaute there they receive Light
from all sides, and are less fet off, be they ever to much railed.
Wherefore, Statuary joined to Architecture, in fuch Manner as it
ought to be, is the Bufinets of a judicious Artifl, and for which so
one is qualified without great Praltice.
As this Study concerns a Painter as well as a Statuary, I shall shew
the former in how many different Manners a Balsrelief may be paint-
ed: And feeing the moft expedicious is always the beft, I shall lay
down that which, by Experience, I have found to be beft.
Firft, I paint my Cloth neat and even, with fuch a Colour as my
Balsrelief requires, whether white, grey, red, yellow, 69c. between
Light and Shade, or in second Tint. Drawing my Ordonnance on
this Ground, I correctly and Rrongly trace it over with black Lead
and after rub it with a dry Cloth that it may Rick fall, and reliff the
Varnith without muddling. Then I varnith it all over, and proceed
to painting; firtt the Shade, and then the second Tint againtt it, leav-
ing the Ground for the Light, and uniting the Shade wich the second

Tint airily, without fofiaing them with a Fitch, I fcumble the
second Tint, either with a Finger or fliff Peacil, into the Grount
Then Itake another Tinr, as dark as my Model direlts; and with it
give a Ground behind my Figures, leaving the Work on the light
side without the leaft Rehef. Being to finith, I rub the whole Work,
of as mich as I can do at once, with a lighter Iint than the firft Ground,
and to very thin and even, that every Thing may appear through it;
obferving here, that the Whice muft be very fiff, and thinned only
with Turpentine. On this wer Ground I clapmy main Lights, which
then, as well as the Shades, will gradually unite with it, without
touching each other.
The second and chird Sorts may be eafily finithed up at ence (the Re-
ronching excepted) as having neither Ground-fhades nor Hollows; the
Method is this My Cloth being prepared as aforefaid, I firft height.
en, fcumbling the main Light into the wet Ground, which, by therun.
ning of the 1urpentine Oil, is become fomewhat tacky: I do the same
with the Shade, leaving the Ground in this Condition for the second
Tint. 1i the Work is to be very neat, I rub it over with a good Var.
nith, mixed with some fat whire Oil, that ir may not dry to foon, and
that I may with cafe, and as long as I pleafe, paint upon it, heighten
ing on the most Relieved Parts, and giving dark Touches in the Hot
lows, fcumbling allo here and there tome smale with a foft Firch, and
tome Vellow in the Reflexions of the Shades. If the Back-ground
ought to be a little darker, now is the Time for doing it, becaule then
it will no more go in.
The laff fortneeds no other Groundchan the firft; and it ought to
be neat and even; becaute the Light on one side, and the Shade on the
other, make the Work Relieve and Rife fufficienly: Vec. ler us ob
ferre, that as often as we paint or re-touch, it muft be rubbed over with
Varnith, or at leall where neceffary, to prevent its going in : For fuch
is the Nature of Varnith, that it will bear but one Painting; otherwill
the Work finks prefencly.
We shall now thew what is to be obferved in Painting Figures in deeg
Nicbes; a Work not to be performed, either with respelt to the Figures
or Groundshades, without due Knowledge in Peripective, whatever
Applaate Ignorants may get from thate who do not underfland

orey Figure in 2 Niche, and being cold, that the Ground-hade was a
Watter of much Importahce, and ought allo to be correll, and being
at the fame Time thewn the Model it was painted by, went immedi-
ately and got a Niche made: But for Want of a Figure he borrowed
his Mafters, and fet ir in the Niche, tracing therein the Ground hade
with black Lead; agreeable to which, he gave all his Figures, in what
Altion foever, the same Ground-shade.
Now, it's certain, that Things painted on firm Places ought, that
they may look natural, to have their proper Groundshades according to
the Relief; well obferving, r. Whence they receive their Light, front-

termine their Shades; as one, fomewhat thort, Charp and frong, as be

in Proportion as they go off from it.
As a Furtherance to the Arriff, I shall treat fomewhat of the Paint-
ingon worden Vafes, Urns, Cifferns, and the like, or on other fmooth
Objects.
As Things painted on fmooth Objects, flanding in large and wide
Places, can have no Relief or Projecture on the Sides, when feen front-
ing; forifing and projecting Ornaments, fuch as raifed Figures, Lions
heads, Feffoons and the like, are very improper and unnatural on them,
unlets being fixed and immoveable, they were feen but from one Side; for
then you may pant as flrong and Relieved Things upon them as you
pleale, avoiding the Side going off, fince the (mooth Roundacls of the
Figure does not admit it. The moveable Objects which are uled, and
feen from all Sides, uft have a froncing Light, and be painted very
Rat or faint, and with no rifing Swells; and the Ground, of what
Colour foever tis, be laid in fuch Manner, that what is painted on it,
whether Figure or other Object, be fet off by a dark Tint in irs Our-
line, and this to be darker or lighter, as it ought to be more or less
rounding: Vet the main Light mult be fomewhat dronger than the
Ground.
Astothe Coloars, there are many which agree well together; as La.
pis Lazuti inlaid with Gold; alfo green Serpentine, with White, as

of Promise, to one who underllands his Buliness. He geis Money, and
has the Efteem of the Great. On this Account, a Statuary in our
Country ought to be fomewhat acquainted with Painting, as being
obliged to make a Virtue of Neceffity. I knew one, who, for this
Reaion, applied to much to Painting; that he changed the Stone into
Cloch, and his Chizels into Paller and Pencils: For, said he, Peeple here

will fcarce pay for the Cloth, much less lay out so much Money for a Block
of Marble. Iescertain, they cannot always carry fuch heavy Baggage
along with them; I speak with respect to thole, who hang their Houles,
Galleries, Halls or Apartments with Cloths, and caute them to be
pairied with Statues and Bals-reliefs, which at any Time, in Cale of
Remoral, Fire or other Accidents, they may roll up, and hang in other
Rooms, which otherwife they could not do; at leaft tis better than to
paintevery Thing on the Walls themfelves, as was the former Cuftom;
lince this Country is not like Ialy or France, where the Painting in
Frefse (as divers Palaces and Churches of fome hundred Vears flanding
can teffify) fufficiently pays for Trouble and Charges.

this Point, either for the Pencil or Chizel; becaufe tis to be fir
nith’d not only from the Fables, Emblems, and Bacchanals, but like

I have formerly, in the Book of Ordennance, propoted the Story of
Tadab and Thamar; which, according to Bats relief Management, is,
with little Alseration, (as well as many others) very proper for it,
when you would reprefent two or three Grounds in the same Pice,

ho that Story require, not fo mach Depth: And how fine would fuch
a Bals-relief become the Hall either of a Jow or Chriffian? And if
herein, the servant and the Country-boufe were on a particular Ground,
how plainly would the Matter appear, if naturally expreft? For tho'
many imagine, that a Bafs-relief is in the fame Cafe with a Medal,
which tends only to commemorate this or that Occurrence, of remark-
able Story, I. muft intirely deny it, fince, in my Opinion, the chief
Intention of the former is, in an inftructive Manner, to ferve for adorn-
ing a Building; and the plainer, more artful and incelligible, the better
it is, especially when the Choice of Subject is our own, and we can go
to the Expence of it. Vet painted Bass-reliefs, ought, as well as, a
good Picture, to have their Property; as the Ancients (who brought
this Art to such Perfeltion) have fufficiently fhewn in their fine Re-
mains, which are our beft Models.
I agree with others, that, without an exall Obfervation and Inquis
1y into Antiquity, and the Comments thereon, which some ingenious
Men have left us, we should be almoff Strangers to the hieroglyphic
Seuie of the antique Bals-relicts; for many of them are to foreign and
dark that we can fcarce apprehend what the Ancients would fignity by
them.
We shall therefore make fome Remarks on the long and imall, yet
Ane Bass-relief of Meleager, killd by his Mother, wben sbe burnt the
fatal Wood. Ies certain, that this Story is faintly reprefented; but,
in my Opinion, the Mafter has omitted the Buftle and violent Stir of
Meleager'’s Body, in order to preferve the Elegance of the Action. I
find it allo not flrange, that few can underfland this Story without
tome Writing under it. We there fee the Parce, of three fatal Sifters,
but nothing of the Mother; and tho' we luppose Diass to be prefent
yet that Circumffance does not fully clear the
and mourning,
Meaning. Meleager should rather have had his hunting Equipage
ard Dogs by him, in order to point our his Perfon and Inclina-
Rons. nd tho' the burning of the Wood feem, in some meafure, to
express the Matter, yet I think it too nearly cut and fmooth, and
should be more like a Firebrand. But my greatelt Wonder is, at the
Abfence of the Mother Althes, the who was a principal Perfon, a.
great Princess, and alted this Tragedy orr of Revenge, and feeing tis
one of the greateft Effects of a revengeful Temper, to triumph in the
Prefence of thofe who are overcome. Moreover we fee no aclive Paffi-
ons rule in any Part of the Compofition. Nor can I fay, who the
Woman litting by him is, whether his Mother; Diana; Halania; or

who elfe: I cannot believe the is his Mother, becalift he feems to be as
oll as the. Moreover, we do not perceive in him any Motion of a
Perton in Paih. Nor can I apprehend the Defign of the Face on the
round Board below on the Ground, it not being a Medal for Orna-
ment, tho' doubtless placed there by the Artift for some Reafon: Some
think, it reprefents Rage or Trouble, or elfe Fite;, becaufe the Hair
teems to be flaming. But the Matter might have beef berter expret
by a prefting of the Eyes, fruggling of Arms and Legs, Contraction
of the Nofe, Mouth, Fingers, and Toes and the Trouble and Pain of
the dying Perfon; whereas, here we fee nothing like it; but contrari.
ly, he feems to dic very quictly, as his Arms, lying clofe to his Be.
dy at full Length fufficiently thew. Befides, tis againft the Rule of
Emblems to admit of any Aid, where the Fall can be performed by
the Perfon himself, much less the Addition of two or three Figures to
exprets the Meaning, unless they be Statues; fuch as Tyranny with
Nere, Ambition with Alexander, Valour with Scipie, and to forth.
Irs true, that Painters ufed formerly, before they were acquainted
with expreiting the Pattions in the Face and Geftures, to write them
on Scrolls proceeding from the Figures Mouths, that they might
thereby be underfiood; but as Artifts are now more enlightened, it
would certainly be very improper to fet a Cock or Spar by a Mansit-
ting or standing, in order to thew his Iuduftry, or a Scall by another,
to fignify that he is dead, &c.
By thefe Obfervations is apparent, that our Meleager should rather
have been known by a fine Action and Motion; fince the chief End
of a Reprefentation is to express naturally, and with Energy, the Ni-
ture of the Matter; and this may as well be done in Biss-relief as
Painting if the Story require it. Nevertheless we muft obferve, that
there are some Paftions which do not work externalty, and ought to be
exprefted by Addrions, in order to make them intelligible; fuch may
be Charny, Mercy, Fiety, Liberality, and the like: But Anger,
Madness, or Rage, Pain, Smarl, &c. (which diffurb the Body as well
as the Mind, by irritating the Members) do not require emblematic
Figures of additional Explanations.

is here of any Advantage: If the Scuffs be not like thofe of the
Greeks, they are not proper for Stone, and feem lets congruous with
Antiquity.
Let is therefore not flatter ourfelves, that we can make any Im-
provements, by feeking new Stuffs for our Figures; nor rely too much
on the Dexterity of our Hlands, that, how brittle foever the Stones are;
we can work them, and perform any Thing, even Folds as thim
25 Paper, small lying Draperies, loofe Hair-locks hanging on 2
Thread, Csc. But rather imitate the Greeks, in the Tbinness, Pliable-
ness, and Leofeness of their Draperies, that the beautiful Sway of the
moving Parts be not obttrutted, but plainly perceived under them; un
less in the Cafe of Old People, who, hecaule of their Stiffnets, may be
drelt in cearse Cloth; and yet not as feeming to be a meer Dress
without a Body, but futing close to it, to as to difcover the princi-
put Parts, with the Ends hanging loofely down, not flicking
Out.
Flying Draperies have no Place among Starues, or Bass-reliefs: nd
tho' the latter reprefent Hiftories, yet fuch Draperies are not proper
in them, unlels on the second or third Grounds; where, then, they
may be fixed againtt the Ground, and be no Hindrance.
in a Medal hrile Relieved, or on Urns or Vases, where flying and
running Figures can be reprefented in all Sorts of Hiflories, we may
freely make as many of thofe Draperies as we pleafe; becaute, as we
said in the third Chapter, the principal Motion ought always to be in
Profife, either on a fingle or second Ground.
I willingly allow the Greets to be the Inventors of loofe Draperice,
as being the moft ealy; but that therefore we may not, now Statuary
is arrived at fuch Perfection, make ule of all Sorls of Stults (which is

lays, —Old People are seldom better’d by Tounger, yet it happens in
some Things, especially in this Art. I speak here of Laws only by
Way of Comparifon. Pray obferve, how little the famous Bernini ar
Rome has ried himself up to the Greek Antiquities. By the Force of
his Judgment he has turpaffed them; he has gone fuch Lengths, that
it was indifferent what he met with, whether flying, running, lying,
flanding, naked, or dreff Figures: He did every Thing, not like the
Greets in a Scone -like Manner, but with Draperies fying, rufting,

For, by faving, that Bernins perform’d what the Greeks never did, I
mean, that he drelt his Figures in thick and thin Stufts, in order to

But let me not, by any Micans, perfuade Artifts to imitate the parti-
cular Manhner of this or that Mafter; for every one has the Liberty of
chuling for himself, and 1 preferve mine. What I have advanced is
only 2 Wher for the judicious, by making further Enquiries.
Tis a great Fault in Artifts to fix they Thoughts on a pnole Part
of a Figure, fuch as an elegant Neck, handfom Shoulder, Back finely
mutcled, or beautiful Thigh; which they work out with the greateff
Application and Pleafure, in order to give it a Sofiness; and it that
fucceed well, they are perfectly charm’d with it; infomuch, that we
may often perceive, in what Part their greateft Delight lay: Hence,
it frequently happens, that the Parts of the same Figure are very un-
like in Goodness; and the Hlands and Feet, nay, fometimes the Face,
bungled, for the fake of a well-finith’d Back. It muft be granted, that
the principal Parts are of the moft importance; yet we are not igno-
rant, how much the Leffer can either fet off or deform a beautiful Fi-

WWhy was Van Dyt fo famous for his Portraits, but for having as
much Regard to an Hand as a Facel To an expert Workman it is indif-
ferent, whether he cut a Block of Marble, or make a Model in
Clay; fave that the former requires more Time.
But after all, this Choice of Handling and Neatness is of no Mo-
ment, if the Figure be not weft for or deligned, becaute the greateff
Perfection lies in a Conjunction of both. Wherefore, it is certain, that
if Phidias and Praireles had been Mafters of Berninis Handling and
Elegance, and this laft, the Knowledge of the Greefs, all three would
have deferved the greater Prailc.
Ias readily own as I take it for granted, that. Art owes its Defelts
to Arcifis themfelves; as well in Painting and Staruary, as Archirec=
tere; proceeding not only from Mafters keeping their Pupils ignorant
of their Principles, Experiments, and Secrets, but allo from obtirult-
ing their Advances in the Art: For tho' it were Weakness to think
the Ancients did not underfland it, yet the Decay mult, as I imagings
be principally imputed to the Reafon I have given: From whengg
arofe another Milchief, to wit, an indifference in Pupils: for fur-

WWe obferve, that the Greeks have commonly made more naked Fj.
gures than the Remans: Which I can afcribe to no other Caufe, than
2 Choice of Objects agreeable to their Inclinations, and a Defire to
difplay their Skill in the Composition and Symmetry of the Parts of
an Human Body. In their Statues, they rather chole to reprefent Dei-
fies than Men, and in their Balsrelicfs, rather Bacchanals and Sacrj.
fices, than Hiffories. The Romans, on the other Hland, defirous, by
their Statues and Batsreliefs, to tranfinit the Memories of their Em.
perors to Pofteriry, found themfelves obliged, that they might not go
againft Hiffory, to dress their Figures in the Mode of the Times.
We shall now confider the neceffary Obtervations in printing Statues
and Batsreliefs It is certain, that they muft be very neat and white,
becaufe fuch Works, in Stone, being both hazardous, troublefome, and
cofflr, were never undertaken before the Artifts had cholen fine Blocks
of Marble for that Purpofe. Wherefore, we ought to take Notice of
the Stones, and their Kinds.
Light Marble is various; one Sort intirely ssbite; another, shipp; a
thid, fet-olour &cc. being thus either in Nature, or chang’d thro'
Time. They are all good when free from Spots of Eyes, and appear
well agrinft proper Grounds.
For this Reafon we fee, that the Ancients reprefented the beff and
moff remarkable Hiffories either in Copper or white Marble; as many
Remains on Palaces, Temples, Henorary Arches, Columns, Pyra-
mids, Tombs, Coc. can witness. Single Whire has alo this Advan
tage above the colour’d Paintings, that it does not foon change, and
when it fades, as Marble itfelf is not free from it, it is all of a Co.
lour. The Ufe of it is certainly attended with much less Trouble,
and not lets natural than in Colours: Moreover, we may fooner find
ten Mafters for this Sort of Painting, than three for Colours; becaute
it is but a fingle Part of the rt, and remains always the fame,
and without Alterarion; whereas the Cafe of Colours is quite dif
Terent.
The grey Paintings reprefent only a Wall, or Piece of Stone -work,
but the colour’d ones thew the Life irfelf, feen as thro' a Window:
Wherefore the grey can neither recreate nor ferve for particular Pictures
of Delight; nor can be of further Ufe than in the Places where they
are fet for Ornament, of which they make but a small Part; and
were any Thing elfe to be placed there, it would be bur of the Na-

Wind deadens and greys it, and the Summer revives and makes
it look green again, feeding the very Soul with its Variety of
Flowers.
The white Marble has a particular Colour and Tendernets; as may
be perceived in the Nixture of Colours: Wherefore, it is of great
Moment to fait it well to its ground.
Between grey Stone if ought only to be temper’d with whice and black,
and fofined with light or yellow Oker; but between reddith or Por-
phiry Stone, with a little Vermillion or Indian Red, fomewhar upon
the Fleth-colour, and this in Shade as well as in the fecond Tint. If
you learn this Colour from the Life, your Work will have the imoff

C H A P. VI. Of the Attirudes of Statnes.
ESIDES the Draperies of Statues, fomething is to be obferved
touching their Sways and Poftures; which is a Point of the
greateff Contequence: Wherefore we shall, in the firll Place, thew
what Statues are; next, whether they will admit of any other Vari-
ety than what the Greets have affigned; in the third Place, whether.
thofe, which fince their Times have been in Ufe, are reckon’d as good;
and latile, whether it be not more advifable to follow the Anrique
and good ones, than to feek after new and lets good.
Amidll the infinity of Motions incident to Nature in general, it is
obferred, that every Man has one particular to himfelf, and peculiar
to his Temper, one bultling, another flow, and a third between both:
And this Diltinction cannot but be obvious, even to a Man of fmall
Underflanding, fince from thence, and a Propenlity for Company like
ourfelves, proceed either our Love or Avertion for this or that Per-
fon and their Actions. And if this be granted, we may be affured,
that the ancient Mafters (efpecially the Greeks, who were to famous
for Wifdom) nicely obferved all thofe Motions, as well the internal
as external,, and expreffed them: in their feveral Works. Wherefore
it may then perhaps be inferr’d; that nothing in this Particular remains
for the improvements of Afterages: But let me ask, Why we should
not as well make ple of our bilicies and Judgments in order to go
forward? I think we may, in other Things especially; but pafting by
What

what is already done, we shall proceed to inquire, what a Statue means
and fignifies.
A Statke reprefents an Idol in human Shape: An Idol I fay with
Iespect to irs Origin and Ufe, and (as far as Statuary is concerned) form
il after the beit Proportion, either in Gold, Silver, or other Mecal,
and dexteroutly work’d by the Hand and Judgment of the Arcill. The
Efes of thefe are, to be let in Temples, Courts, Palaces and other pub-
lick Places, but especially to adorn Archirecture. We find them 2s
well in Scipture as Fables: For Inftance, in Afordecar, when royally
arrived he was led, on Horfehack, by Haman thro' the City. Allo
in Cor:r,, when expated, by Pilare, to publick View.
We likewile And Matter for Starues in profane, even recent Stories:
F
As for lnmance, in the late King Witham and Qucen Hlary, of bleffed
Memory, moulded from the Lite, and fee up in the Temple of Henour,
and tuch like. None of thefe Pieces thew either active, paffionate, or
violent Motiors, but plain or grave, and majettic, fuitable to the Dig-
nies of the Perfonases they reprefent, and which we ought to conti-
der as Genrlemen or Ladies, who, flanding at Doors or Windows to
fee, and be feen by the People, are ferious and without Motion.
Whence the Proverb feems to arife, — He slands like a Stone-figine,
 or, like a dumb and lifelets Perfon.
Cr Ele:k.
We shall therefore confider two Sores of Starues, the anactive and the
nring. The unafive are fuch as fland fingly in Riches and on Frommif
ores, and the moring or bulling are thofe which are feen in Groups
of =or 2, on FedzEnls, triwnftal Arcpes, and Fountains.
Now, its certain, that thefe two Sorts of Statues mult needs hare
Particular Purpoles, and therefore particular Places: For the former
are teen from a single Stand, for which they are properly made, and
the latter are to be viewed round about from all Sides. But of this we
shall tay more in the next Chapter.
As to this larter Sort of Starues, they receive not their Appellati-
ons from the Perions they reprefent, but from the Aftions they per-
formed, or to: Ahsartunes they unferwent And herein lies the
main Point, tince, without them; the Persons fingly of themfelves
would not be known; as in the Steries of Seneca, Petus, Laocoon, Py
rimas and others. And thefe Occurrences or Accidents mult be but once,
art en one Occation attribured to them. Suppole any of thefe Perfons
were to be reprefented by a fingle Statue, as Lyocoon with a Serpent,
Bruwas with a Sword, 6c. What Difference would there be between

one who once committed fuch an Alt, or bore fuch a Calamity, and
one who in his Life-time, had gone thro' a thouland Accidents, as Her-
cules, Tbefeus, Achilles, Hecter and many others, who are reprefent
ed by one Statue! Wherefore we may eafily conceive, that the Anci-
ents have in every Respect to firmly fixed and orderly dipoted their
Poltures, that there is no room left either for Alteration or Addition.
Befides, we fee, that no Addicions of the modern Maffers are like the
Antique, either in Qualicy or Goodness, as is evident in the Works of
Quellin, Keyzer, Bernini, and many others, who made no Dillinction
between Statues and Starues.
if I seem here to contradict myself, becaufe, having in the preceding
Chapter fet thole three great Mafters almoll above Antiquity, I now
place them below it, let it be obferved, that I am speaking of Statues,
not of Bass reliefs; for herein they have neither excell’d nor been equal
to Antiquity in the Beauty, Air, and Variety of Draperies.
The Ancrents, in their Statues, had in View three principal Conditi-
ons and Natures of Men; the gay, the beavy, and the moderate: The
82j, are altive, full of Fire, and flender like the Apotto; the second are
melancholy, flow and liftlets, like the Antinous; and the third Sort is
compoted of a Temper between both, as the Mfercurius radians, which
receives its Light from below. All thefe were ercht by Perrier. We
alfo commonly obterve, that the active and airy are feldom long with-
out Motion, now flanding on one Leg, then, on the other: Accord-
ingly, the Ancients reprefented fuch a Perfon flanding on one Leg.
relling little or nothing on the other Foot: But, being to exhibit an in-
dolent, voluptuous, melancholy one, like Antinous, we may plainly
dilcover, how heavily he flands on one Leg, and yet reils on the other
Foot, his Belly sticking out, Head hanging down, and Hips exceffively
riting. The Contrarieties of thefe two Figures are worthy of Remark;
one leems to fly, and the other to be finking into the Earth. As to
the Exprestion of the third Figure, (which is a Mean between the two
Sorts aforelaid) he, as a well-temperd perfon, is made flanding firm
on his Legs, looking thoughtfully down, without any Turn, not too
Hery or eaty, nor too much funk; one Hip fwelling a little more thin
that of Apollo, and fomewhat lets than that of Antinous, and tho' reft-
ing on one Leg, yet appearing more firm than the one, and more airy
than the other.
Now, as the Ancients Knew how to divide thofe three different Bo-
dies to very nicely, according to their Nacures and Action, to we need
not question but they handled all treir other Figures in the lame Maa-
HIcr.

ner: I fpeak, in reference to their Qualities, as a Kill-flanding Baccbus,
Mers, Hereales, Satarn, &c. Even the Women, Goddeffes, and Nymphs
not excepted; all which proceed, either in a greater or lets Degree,
from the three Standards before mentioned: This Truth is evident not
only from thefe Examples, but likewife from what we daily meet
with, whether in Models or Prints. Ler us then not imagine, that we
are able to inveat new Actions for our Statues, or others than thote
which are already found, much less, that they should be better and
more proper; but rather employ our Thoughts more advantageoutly
on other things, and in the mean Time implicitly follow the Ancients
in a Study to noble, and in which they took to much Pains.
The main Point lies in the beautiful Sway of a Statue, well
expred according to the Quality, Condition, Nature and Intention of
it. But hereby I mean not, that we are obliged punctually to imitate
the Actions and Poftures of the Ancients, without the leaff Deviation;
contrarily, every Man has the Liberty of exercifing his Ingenuity: 1
propote their Works only as Patterns which I have always followed,
and would have others do the fame, without Fear of being therefore
call’d Copyilts, or their Works, Copies. Such a Moderation I think
even very commendable, fince the Fable of Learas teaches us, that
High fyers have often great Falls; or, by avoiding Scylls, they get
into Chargbdis.
There Hill remains a neceffary Remark, touching the Explanatory
Addituments of Statues; and, to be brief, I shall thew their Natures in
three particular Starues, and chufe out of many, the Stories and Fi
gures of Lxcretis, Dido, and Thisbe, among the Women. Thole of
the Men may, on the fame Foor, be eafily apprehended.
I reprefent thefe three Women with Daggers in their Hands, to de-
note that they fell by thofe Weapons.
Lxcrefis is grave and majeftic.
Dids, haughty and proud. And
Thisbe, very plain and City-like.

Rands the Figure of Pyramus, and on the other, two Turles. Un-
demeath thefe two latter, appears the Fact itself, as in the firft.
Thefe I think fufficient Examples for further Reprefentations; as
having thew’'d the Difference in three, which are almoll conformable to,
each other.

CHAP. VIl. Of the placing of Figures upon Pedeffals, Fromifficces,
in Niches, and other Places.
T is evident, that Statuary has a Dependance on Architelture, and
is regulated by it: And as Firures adorn and give Life to a Land-
ship, to Statuary embellifhes, and makes Archirecture look grand. AA
good Landskip-painter knows what Objelts are moft proper for an Ordon-
nance, and what Forms they mult have, whether crooked, ftrait, sland
ing, fitting, to the left or right, in order to produce Decorum, as we
have hewed in the Chapter touching irregular Objects: And a skilful.
Architelt ought to be as well acquainted with the Mechod of fetting
off his Work with Figures, Balsreliefs and other Ornaments, according
to Rule, that it may thereby become not only magnificent and elegant.
but we may plainly perceive, it muft be so and not otherwife. He should
allo know, why tome Figures ought to face, and others look from each
other; why thefe mult fwell or rife outwardly, thole be upright or sit-
ting, &c.
Upon this Account, the Statuary ought rightly to underfland the
Architelt's Intention, Tere he proceed to work; as alto what Figures he
is to make naked or cloathed, be they of Men, Women or Children,
on what Side they ought to rife or fwell, and how bent; and from
What Side feen, and whether they mult fland high or low, and to forth:
being apprized of thefe Particulars, he is then to execuce his Thoughts

Thus much, as to theie two ative Siffers.
in relation to the third, to wit, Painting, which embraces them
Foth, as needing their Aid, I mull fay, that as it makes the Elegan-
cies of Archredure and Staruary, whether in Hiffory or Landskip,
its chief Study, to a judicious Painterought, for adorning his Archi

redure with Figures, Batsreliefs, Gc. to be thoroughly acquainted
with them, that he may naturally exprets them with Shade and Colour;
even; to much as thereby to corred the inevitable Mif thapes fill to be
observed in Nature.
Tis unaccountable, that, among to many good Architelts, Starua.
ries, and Painters, fo few have underfood the richt placing of Statues:
They tometimes hir it, but not upon certain Principles. Wherefore

es; hoping tiat no Offence will be taken at my adapting the Matter
allo to Painring, fince is has fo near a Concern therein.
As there is nothing in Nature without imperfection, fo, in the Ufe
of Things, we ought to proceed with Judgment, in order to chule the
beff for the Satustaction of our own Eyes, as well as thofe of the
Knowirg and Lovers.
in the placing of Starues in Architecture, the same Regard muft be
had wherever they fand or fr. I speak not of Painting, alone, but
what generally concerns both the Arrs; Statuary in the firft place,
and afterwards Painting. See Plates L XV. and LXVI.
Behold the Skerch in Plate LXV. with Accention, and my orderly
Difpoficion of the Starues in different Places; fufficiently to evidence
the Regularity of my Scheme to any one who has a mind to try the
COntyary.
Here, you are only to obferve the Our lines of Couples or Pairs of
Figures, and their Posfures againf each orher ; for a fingle Figure ads
for irfelf, but a pair or couple of Figures thews the Refult of both.
I have formerly afferred, what conflitutes a beautiful Action,
sawely, a geod Tarn of the Members and Motion of the Head, Armm,
Hands and Feet.
The 1ft Example chiefly concerns Statuaries, who, hy obferving thaif
Pofition, will thew that they underfland it, and are able to order and
make large Things as well as fmall.
The 2d Example respects Painters, tha' it be the same as the ford
mer, in reference to the Our line; but with respeet to Sbade, wheat

we are confined to a fingle and fixed Light, we ought to chule a proper
and advantageous one, that the Out-ne, as our principal Purpofe,
may thereby maintain its Force, and produce the Effeet and Decorum we
defire; as you fee here with its oppofite.
We have formerly faid, that the Out-line without the Shale is of no
Effeft; and that a beautiful Action and Out-line may lofe their Ferce, and
the Gracefulness be spoilt by an improper Light; which Mis- pape is very
vifible in sharp and broad Lights, and mere difagreeable than in stirring
Figures.
The gd Example concerns thofe who paint Figures, Balsreliefs,
and other Ornaments, either in whice, red, yellow or ofher colour’d
Marble, or Stone. Here, obferve not only the Outline, as in the
firft Example, or the fame paded, as in the second, but likewife the
Colour of the Stone, as well in the Shade as Light: I tay, especially in
the Sbade, becaute therein appears the greateff Variety, either by means
of the Air, or fome other Reffexions.
Another of our Politions has been, that all Objects retain their naty-
ral Beauty in the Shade, unless they receive Reffexions from other Things;
bkewife that White is the most susceptible of it, and, by its Cleanness, easly
receives whatever Colour it meets with. Confider allo, the great Diffc-
rence between the Clofenels and Solidity of Marble, and the Thinnels
and Tranfparency of Linnen. In the third Example you will find that
white Marble, not without Reafon, produces yellow or ruffet Shades;
wherefore you ought carefully to confult Nature, in order to imitate her
with Knowledge.
But to return to the firft Example, let us abferve how two opposing
Figures appear in their Out line. Firft, upon the Frontispiece, where
thele two Figures swell outwardly, the Faces either regarding or turning
from each other, and the Arms the same; and the middlemoll prast,
without swell, and frenting; and thote on the outtides allo with licle,
of ne Turn, as being feen only forward: Secondly, the two Figures on
each Side of the Steps likewile swell outwardly, yet mere turning than the
others, becaute being allo feen lidewife, they ought to be beautifut from
three Sides: Thirdly, the foremoft Figure may have as much Turn and
Attion as you please, and be good quite round: Fourchly, tne Figures
in the Niches are frenting, without the leaft Turn or Stir, and the great-
off Swell is forwards. lus allo very proper for the Rien to sand below,
and the Women above; becaute the Woman tapers upwards, and there-
fore is more dilappearing and usiting with the fir; which, in Archi=
fecture

relture has a fine Effelt. For this Reafon they formerly offentimes fet
mall Pyramids on the Tops of Houfes, inflead of Figures.
The uppermsl Figures, againtt the Sky, look beft naked, becaute of
their Airimess; thole in Niches mult be maffy and dref; and those be-
low on the Ballytrade, half dred. Thus much as to the firft Skerch.
The 2d Example thews the Method to be uted when it happens;
that the Stall canfes a visble Deformity on the swelling Part of a Ei.
gure; as to help it by the Disposition of an Arm, Bit of Drapery or
Hand: I mean, in a Painting, where the Light remains atways the
(ant, and to which Statuaries are not tied, especially in the open Air,
becaute the Light continually afters, but in a Painting not; for as
Things are painted they fland This Remark is worth noting; as well
in Kirring as Htill Figures.
In the sd Skeich, I exhibit a flanding Figure in a Niche, and be.
tween them a Batsviol, fuppoled to be of yellowith or rufset Wood;
which Colour, becaute the Figure is of white Marble, gives prong Re.
fexions. On the Side, we fee another Figure, between the Greens;
and a third lying on the Ground furrounded with the ir: In all three
I have one and the fame incention, viz. to thew the Couse of the Mix
fare of the Skiles; otherwife, the Figures will fometimes teem to be
made of two Serts of Stuff, as the light Parts White, and the Shades
of some other Colour. A due Obfervation of this enables us to antwer
for what we do.
Altho’ now by thefe Politions about the flirring ctions, I feem to
contradict former ones, namely, that in painting of carving Statues, we
ought to give them but lirtle Turn, yet in Fact I do not: ( spake there
only touching a fingle Figare; whereas here are many in Company, and
thofe fet upon Pedeftals, Fountains, and the like Places, where they
are feen from all Sides; which creates a Difference as well in their Na.
fures as Circumllances.
If I am raxed with Prefumption for taking upon me to place fr
gures, and fee naked ones and Women above, and Men, with thofe which
are dreft, below, I anfwer, that my Conduct is founded on Architec
ture, which intimates, that the five Orders are peculiar to five diffe
rent Conditions of Men; as Polyphemus, or the Giants, for the firft Or
der; Mars, as robult or mufculous, for the second; Apolle, for his
Stendernels, for the third; Diana, or Vents, as womanith, for the
fourth; and Iris, or Cpid, for the fifth. This Confideracion will, 1
think, as well embolden as juffify me.

Statuaries very imperfelt in them, as if of lets Confideration than
Bodies.
Some Statuaries do not fufficently vary their Faces, making little
Difference between Vouth and ge, giving alfo much into the modern
Way of Afettation, and exaggerating the Parts, without any Regard to
tbe Antiques. By Affettation and exaggerating, I mean, a Kind of
Fondnels in Artifts for a particular Manner; as, to make the Eye-lids
of their Figures too large, which caufes an heavy look; and to cut the
Dimples on each side of the Mouth, and the Hollows of the Nofe,
and Neck, too deep, feemingly thewing the Fatness of Women:
Whereas, they ought rather to be fomewhat more expreffive in the
Mutcles; fince, according to the Turn of the Head, thofe rife more
of less, especially in thin and aged People: I fpeak only of giving a
Variety to the Look and Breafts: For Faces mult not be always alike
graye and lofty; there muff be, wanton ones as well as modeft, large-
teatur’d as well as tender, fuitable to the Bodies;, the Cafe is here
the fame with the Neck and Brealls, fome are growing, others full
gTown.
Much is to be obferved about the Make of the Hands, and Set of
the Feet, especially when naked and without Sandals; but the Marter
lies moft in ordering the Toes: The three foremeft ought to be the
longest, and close, turning out more or less with the Tread of the Feet;
whereas some turn them in, the great one lying ftrait with the Foor,
and the reft againft it, which looks very uncomely. See the Examples
in Plate LXVil. and the Difference between them; of which, the two
Oppermoll thew the Upicemliness, and the three others the Ele
fance 1 peak of And tho' many have Calts of beautiful Womens
Hands for conflant fe, yet thefe (as has been faid of Faces.
Brealls, CSr.) cannot, on all Occafions, ferve for the Difference of the
Sexes; for Women have thicker and more tapering Fingers, and fimaller
Nails than Men, who, according to their Bulk and Age, have morg

AV ING, in the second Chapter fouched upon Modelling, which
A is a Practice of great Concern to a curious Arcifl, I shall here
deliver my further Thoughes about it.
The making Models, whether in Clay, Wax, or other foff Matter,
is both ulefol, delightful, and neceffary for a Statuary as well as
Painter, indeed, for all who endeavour at any Perfeltion in the Arn;
for by this Prattice (in Reference to the Relief of Things we are to
reprefent, whereby it teems always to have Life itfelf) we obtain a
Firmnets, and at the fame Time a bold Handling. It disburthens our
Thoughts, and makes fuch latting impreffions on the Mind, that we
need be ar no Loss about the Lite. We mult be fentible of the great
Advantage arifing from it, becaute we can model in the aforefaid Bo-
dies, Baisreliets, Foliage, and other Ornaments from the Anciquities,
on all Sorts of Objects, as Alears, Vafes, Dithes, Candlefficks, Cifferms,
E5c. and then paint them with such Colour as we pleafe; allo gild or
bronze them, according to the Ufe we would put them. to. By the
Jame Means we may have Store of elegant Swordhilts and Helmets,
Greek as well as Roman, to ferve any Occation. In thort, a good Mo-
deller can help himfelf out of any Difficulties. Therefore let me ad
vife you to fall boldly to work, and make Batsreliets, Sphinzes,
Tombs, Vafes, or any Thing elfe neceffary in the Art. Vou may
Likewile get fmall wooden Pithes and Pors of divers Kinds turned, and
prettily adorn them with Wax-imagery of Satyr's Faces, playing Chil
dren, dancing Nymphs, (c. Thefe Things may be uteful in any
Manner of Painting, whether the Piece be Sun-fhine, or Moon or Car
dle lights. If you would go further, you can divert yourself with
modeiling Medals in Wax, and oblige a Friend with a Cafl of
them.
Many of the molt famous Mafters have praltifed Modelling; as fut
fciendy appears in ther Works. The Truth is, we can make any
Thing we want, even what no body elfe has, and is no where to be
purchafed, to paint after, as from the Life itfelf.

wis, &c whether the Pedeffals ought then to be reprefented fo unliker
My Opinion is, that they mull not, as being contrary to Rule and Or-
der. If both Figures be Aen, the Pedeftals ought to swelt at Bottom;
if both Women, en Top; and if a Man and a Woman, both ought to be
plain: If there be a Weman between two Men, the Side-pedeftals muft
be plain, and the middle one particular to iffelf; and the contrary.
Plain Pedetals, tho' bearing dreff Figures, Vafes, or Bulls, fuit not
betweentwo Colunns or Pilafers; at lealt, they ought to hellow in, not
twelf our.
The Height of a Fase, placed between two Figures, muft not ex-
ceed three Foarths of that of the Figures, incluive of the Pedeftal;
that is, up to the Breafts, and no higher.
A Bul, with its Pedeffal, should not rife above Mans Height,
the Pedellal not swelling our, but the contrary; as in the Ex-
amples.
Where two Prfes and a Buf are placed in a Gardeh between two Fj.
gures, the ourward Pedeftals ought to be of the fame Height with the
middlemofl, and plain, the two others muft hollow in or fwell out,
according to the Courfe of the Vafes, and be a third, or half, lower,
yet retain the fame Breadth with the others.
A Vafe, twice as high as broad, and running up firait, ought to
have a square fwelling Pedefial. The Contrary will produce the same


Decorum.
If a Byl fland between two Vafes, they muft be level with the
Shoulders of the Figure. The contrary is allo gord, provided the
Pedeftal be fomew har bigger, and fuited to the Courfe of the Vafe.

It is certain, that the Defign of Temples, built in Honour of the

Prayers of Sacritices. WTherefore it is a great Fault in Ignorants, to

accrusing to thefe who thoroughty confider and put it in Execution;
we shall now, for the fake of weak Capacities, proceed to Stittlife,
or, immoveable and inanimate Tbings; fuch as Flowers, Fruits, Gold, Sil
zer, Stone, Musical Indruments, dead Fish, Exc. and thew which are the
beft and of moff Advantage. Thefe may, in their Turns, in different
Mianners, ferve for Materials for a natural Compoficion, wherewith to
pleafe all Sorts of Men, the Great as well as the Lirle, the Learned
as lgnorant. Wherefore, out of many, we shall fix on the following
Objects, as the moft beautiful, elegant, and agreeable.
1. Floters.
2. Fruit.
3. Goll, Sikver, and other rich Tkings.
4. Mufral In:ruments.
Thefe four Sorts, arrfully order’d and perform’d, may ferve for the
Ornament of Halls and Cabinets as well as the beft Paincings, pro-
vided ther have a proper Light, and bang together. But we mult
Know, in the tirft Place, what conflirutes a good Still-life-piece, fince,
tho' ir be naturally handled, nothing but a good Choice can charm the
Sentes, and bring Fame to the Matter. Tis Weakness to think that
faded Flowers thould pleafe, much lets in a Pilture: Or who would
hang a Piece of ordinary, unripe, or rotten Fruit in his beft Room,
and among a Cabinet collection, feeing the Life itfelf is to difagreea-
ble? Such Rubbith I did formerly admire; but as they only thew the
Deformiries of Nature, I have no Appetite to view them any more.
Bur, to return to the Subject.
My Opinion is, that the Beauty and Goodness of a Still life con
fitts only in the moft choice Objects: 1 fay, the most choice; 2s.
2mong Flowers, the molt rare and beautiful, and the fame in Fruits
and other Things. Thefe will gain a Mafter Credic, especially with
the Addition of tome particular Significutions proper to them. It is not
probable that wealchy People should be delighted with old-fathiond
Plate and Furniture, when they can have every Thing more beautiful
and elegant; and as improbable, that judicious Lovers of Mulick
should be pleafed with the modern Lyre, Dulcimer, or Bag-pipe. As
for Cabbages, Carrots, and Turnips, as likewife Codfith, Salmon, Her
rings, Smells, and fuch-like (which are poor and mean Ornaments, and
not worthy of any Apartment) he who is pleated with them may feek
them in the Markets I as little approve of Horfe-furniture and hunt
ing Equipage; tho' thefe latter, with wild Boars, Stags, Hares, Phea-
Lants,

mens Fancies, are more tolerable.
Having thus in general couched on Still life, let the Judicious deter-
mine which Sort is belt and moft advantageous either to the Painter of
Purchafer.
As for me, I think Eloquence very charming to the Ear; but Good
ness alone makes Beauty amiable. What is a fine Flower, Apple, Gold
Cup, or well-cund Violin, without good Smell, delicate Tafle, proper
Ufe, and agreeable Sound? Goodness, 1 fay, ought to be perfectly ap-
parent: The Smell, Taffe, Hearing, or Sound cannot be painted; but
may be, in fome Meafure, expreft by occult Significations, either in
Balsrelief by Fables, Hicroglyphicks, or emblematick Figures, or by
many other Things, if the Will be not wanting.
As to the Nature and Property of the Places for Stilllife, they are
two fold, clole and open; the one reprefenting it as if banging against a
Wall or Wainicot, and the other, as lying on a Bench or Table, or on
the Ground.
We allo fuppofe, that no Objects ufed in Still-life ought to be repre-
fented less than the Life.
Tis likewife improper, and againtt the Nature of Still-life, to intro-
duce, in any of the before-mention’d Choices, colour’d Back-works, or
Viffos, either clofe or open, that is, Landskip, rchitecture, or any
Kind of living Creatures; which would fpoil the very Name of a Still-
life: Moreover, it is difficult, if not impoltible, for fuch a Painter to
hit every Thing; and granting he can, I yet queftion, whether he
would be pleafed with the Title of a Still-life Painter.. I fay then,
that the Depth of the Picture is only to be reprefented by an hanging
Curtain, or a Bassrelief of Wood or Stone, of fuch a Colour and Iint,
as belt fuits the general Decorum; the one darkifh, and the other fome.
what lighter. With Flowers, a dark-grey Back-ground fuits better
than a white, yellow, or red one. With Frsit, white and grey Mar
ble, but not yellow or red. Vet, as a fine Balsrelicf requires more
Skill than a Flower or Fruit, and fuch like, you may, inflead thereof,
introduce a Niche, with a God or Goddess's Buft therein, proper to the
Subjett, as a Flora, Pomend, Barthus, Apolle, Diand, or others, ac-
cording to the incent of your Delign, and as you would have it bear
either a particular or general Meaning,, which each of thole Figures.
will fupply in Abundance. Flowers are various; and, like Fruits, may
be divided into three Sorts, to wit, the Spring; Summer and Aucumn;.
and, having different Qualities, are fit for many fine and uncommon:

Defigns, in Conjimition, with Bats reliefs or Bukls, as I have faid; with
this Caution, that with Flowers fuit no Fruit, but Ears of Corn, as
being airy and pliable; but among Fruits may be fome Flowers, espe-
cially fuch as allude to Reff and Alirth, as Poppies and Rofes. And
yer thefe agree bel with Grapes, either in Garlands or Feffoons.
Let us now, for Exercife and Improvement in this Point, obferye
what the Learned lav. The white litly is facred to June; Turnfel to
Apollo; the Roje to tenus; Diang and Somnus claim the Poppies; Geres,
the Corn-Flowers; June, the Pomegranates; Bacchus, the fig-tree and
fine; Ceres, or, 1is, the Peaches and Ears of Corn; Venus and Apello,
the degles; Ofs, or Mother Earch, every Thing she produces througheut
the Tear. Of Inftruments, the Lyre is dedicared to Apollo, Mercury, and
the lives; the Fiate, to Pan and Venus; the Trumpet, to Mars, &cc.
CH AP. II., Designs for Bass reliess proper to Still lise.
ITH Flevers fuit Lephyrus and Flora, or Venus and Adonis,
in Courtthip.
With Fraits, Ceres and Pomona, or Pomond and Pertumnus. Wich
Grafes, Bacchus and friadne, and merry Bacchanals: And, if therebe
Afalberries among them, a fleexing Sitenus with the Nymph SEgle is
moft agreeable.
With Musscal Intruments, Apelle and the nine Muses; Orphens play-
ing, of Arion on the Delphin. With a Timbrel, Cornet and Cymbal,
2 Bucchanalian Sacrifice, Feaff, or Dancing.
To the three Seasons, as Spring, Summer and Autumn, in one Piece,
we may apply Tenus, Ceres and Bacchas firting together according to
their Ranks. I exclude the Winter, as improper and difagreeable, and
simitting of no other than poor Interpretations; fuch as Hiunger, fe
nury, Cc. which this Seafon brings with it.
That thete Balsreliefs may have due Decorum, you mull obferve,
that in Garlands they ought to be Octangular; in Fefteons, round; and
in Groags or Bunches, square and parallel with the Frame, especially
when difpoted hanging above, below, and on the Sides: Bur when in
Corners, 2 Compartment fuits better, and this to be (quare above, and
femi-circular at Bottom and both Sides. Thus much as to close Bass
reliefs in general. As for the Reltef, the flatter is is, the betier, and

without the leaft Ground sbade, in order to prevent all Maffery and
Confusson.
Touching the other Sert of Still-life, either flanding or lying in deep
Niches, or on Benches or Tables, we have before obferved, that it
ought not to be represented less than the Life, and therefore mult come
quite forward in the Piece, as appearing then in its full Force and Qua-
Ley; even much better with a Light coming from without than within,
a Frent, than Side-light.
There are three Sorts of Grounds which elegantly fet off Fruits.
Grapes, especially the blue, and Cherries, blue Plums, and all Fruits
inclinable to be dark, require one of Freeftone. But Apples, Peaches,
and Apricocks appear better on a dark grey Ground. there is a third.
Sort, as Pumpkins, Melons, Oranges, Strawberries, and others, which
bell become a white Ground, whether they be lying on a Bench or Ta-
ble, or in a deep Niche.
I shall now defcribe fome Deligns, which I hope will not be
imacceptable to the Artiff. The firft contains the three bleoming.
Seasons.
Table, or Ordennance.
This Piece exhibits a compass headed Niche, (quare within, and its
Depth equal to its Diameter. Therein I place a beautiful Vale; either.
of Cryftal, Copper, or Gold, with Flowers; of which, I fet the short-
eft halkt in the Middle, and the others (preading on the Sides. Above,
in the Middle, on a King, I hang two or three Bunches of the largeft
Sort of Grapes. To the King 1 fatten a small Ribbon, on which:
loofely hang Ears of Corn, intermixed with fome Corn-flowers,
taken up and ried in the upper Corners of the Piece, and hanging
down the Sides. Below, round the Vafe, lies fine. and palatable:
Fruit, of the largeft and beft Sort, as Melons, Lemons, freth Figs,.
Pomegranates, Walnurs, as well as Apples, Peaches, Chinaoranges,.
5r. This is the Subltance of the Piece.
The Dispolition is thus. The Feftoons, in Bunches of an Hands,
Length, are parted with Greens, and tied, which Greens cover the
Stalks of Corn, and being intermixed,, as is faid, with fome blue Flow-
ers, produce an agreeable Mixture, without Mepery.. The Jaums fer=.
ing them off are grey Stone, and the Ribbon dark Violet. The
Crapes, of the largell Sort, tied to a Copper King, are, in the Mid=
dle, white, and thole hanging on each side, blue, with a green Leaf.

or two: This Croup is well fer off againtt the Shade of the Hollow
of the Niche, without drawing the Eye from the principal. My in.
tention is, to dispose the Flowers into a large Mass of beautiful and light
ones; the ftrongelt and fulleft to be in the Middle, confilting of white,
fellow, and light red. The higheft next the Grapes to be a Tum
1ol, and on the Sides, others of lets Force and Colour, intermix’'d here
and there, with a beautiful blue one. And becaute the Vafe, on ac-
count of the Room which the Fruits lying about it take up, cannot
sland quite forward, the Flowers preading on the sides mult be in
Shads. The Fruirs I dilpole contrary again; as the biggeft on the leff
Side, and the imallell and moft tender, tuch as Peaches, Apricocks, and
Plums, on the right: They should be ltalian Fruits, especially the le
mons at lea? two Fids big, as being the Chief of the Group, and govern
ing the reil. If betides the Seasons, you would repreient fome other
Aleanings, add a Lyre, Violin, or other mufical inftrument, which may
be fer or hung againtt the light side of the aforefaid Hollow; and thus
the Piece is compleat.
And now, curious Still life Painters! view this Example with Atten
tion, and confider whether 1 propoie to ye any Difficulty above your
Abiliries. Ve Flower-painters, is it more troublefom and artful to imi-
tate 2 Grape, Apple of Peach, than a Rofe, Lilly, or Turnfol? And
ye who practife Frut only, what Difficulty has a Flower more than
Fruits, a Pomegranate or Mielon inwardly or outwardly? Any of thefe
may be fer flanding or lying before ye, as long as ye pleafe; and fo
may an Harp, Violin, Lyre, or Flute: Thefe can ffore ye, and are all
in your Power, and your Eyes can determine the Proportiens, Meafures
and Forms of all that flands fill, hangs, or lies, and the foft Pencil,
skilfuly handled, bring them naturally and properly on the Clock.
Why then do ye fo often obflinacely build on a fingle Sore! a beauti
ful Flower will certainly pleafe the Eye, but more, in Conjunction with
some freth and palatable Fruit, and higher yet, with the Addition of
fome fine Mufical Inftruments. Vour Cloth may take in fomething of
each, and yet ye moft Times do it with a fingle Sort. If it be a Flow.
er-piece, your Cloth mult however be filted, as it allo mult when the
Subject is Fruits and Mufical Inftruments. When we fay, a Man is2

Slanding slill, lying, or hanging.

Secend Ordennance, being the Reverfe of the former.
The chief Object in this Ordonnance is a low or shallow Basker of Frair.
taking up, in Breadth, the major Part of the Opening. This Basket
is fill’d with all Sorts of cender and palatable Frait. Inflead of the
Grapes over it, I fatten to the King a Bunch of Flowers with elegant
Greens, fied up, as in the former; and againt the Jaumbs of the Niche
some mufical Inftruments, as a Flute, Trumpet, Baffoons, Corncis,
Haulboys, Coc. On the right side of the Basker, lies a porcelain Dith
of Strawberries; and behind it, fomewhat deeper in the Niche, a wide
Glass of Mulberries, Cos. The hanging Feffoons, on each side of the
Burch of Flowers, confiff moftly of Ears of Corn and Greens. The
main Light takes the Basket of Fruir, confifting moftly of lightifh
white, yellow, and fomewhat red ones, and the chaded Side, of dark,
black or violet. The Bunch of Flowers over it, contrarily, is made
up of blge, purple, violet, and a little white and yellow. The mutf=
cal Inftruments the fame. The other Things, encompaffing thete, as
the Ears of Corn and Greens, explain themfelves.
This Piece, thus difpoted and artfully executed, is a propermatching
Pifture for the preceding.
We shall fubjoin a third Ordonnance of a Massepiece, (implying
Harmony) no less elegant than the two former.
Third Ordennance.
in the Middle of the Hollow of the Niche, I place, on a Desk, 2
large Book of Mulick, opening long-ways, on one Side whereof is
prickt the Cantas, and on the other the Bass, either in Church of

The Helwet denotes an inclination for War, and a martial Spirit.
The Shield, allo a Token of Defence, was to much regarded by the
Ancients, that they made a Prefent of it to Conquerors, in Confiders-
tion of their Valour and Conduct. Virgil, in his qth Book, mentions
TExeas's ordering a Shield to be brought to him, wherewith to reward
the Fidelity and Valour of Nrsus. The Argives had a Cultom of
marching young Men (who had by notable Exploits merited the Ho.
nour) with the Sbield of Eshippas carried before them, triumphantly
thro' their Town and Territories. We alto read, that the Palladium,
which the Ancients believed fell from Heaven, was a Shield, myfteri.
oly reprefenting the Protection of the Roman People and Empire,
And, according to Nama Pompiliar's Exvlanation, the Shield implied
Succets and Prosperity; whereby he endeavoured to buoy and comfort
the Reman People, on their being forely vificed, in his eighth Vear;
with a Peftilence which chrearmed the Deftruction of all 1rab. The
Sbields were moreover dedicated to thofe, who had faved the Town
and Common wealch from any great and imminent Danger; and to
perperuate fuch a Benefaction, and as a Spur to Virsue, they cauted
the Story to be engraved or carved on their Shields. The Shield and
Pife alfo fignity War, chiefly in recrieving the Damages fultained by
the Enemy, and in patting them to Flight and deftroying them. Vet
Weapons are of little Advantage, if not ufed with Wifdom and Under
Wherefore, we generally fee Palfus reprefented with a
standing:
Shield and Pike; the latter lignifying Force and Quicknets of Appre-
Neation
The Pitz or Spear allo denores the (preading of a glorious Name.
For which Reafon, according to Pistarch, Lysippus adorned the Scatue
of Atexander with it, tho' others reprefented him with Thunder in his
Hand, intending thereby to immortalize the Atchievements of that
Heroe. The Pife or Arrow allo, being thrown or thot at a Mark,
hicroglyphically fignifies, the (preading of a glorious Name. Vet.
according to the Ancients, the Pifz or Spear not only implied Royal
Grandeur and Authority, but was likewife the ufual Reward for thole
who had shewed their Bravery in conouering the Enemy: As Pling
fays, that Sicinains Destaias, for his admirable Valour, was prefented
with twelve Pifes. Fifus Pempeins thinks, that Generals received the
Pike or Tavelin, in token of their being incrufted with the principal
Management of the War and Empire; and that therefore it was cut
comary to fell the Prifoners publickly, fub Hofa, or. under the Pikt
of Spear.

The Sward, in Reference to War, fignifies Fury, Crucly, Fright,
Persecution and Threatening with Death.
The bent Borw is likewile a Sign of War; and the Arrows fignify
the People, or the Enlargement of Power; alfo Velocity and quicks
Motions.
The Crownof Laurel was the Token of Conquerors, and thole who
performed any glorious Alt,, as the ancient Remains fufficiently inform
us. And we learn from Hiffory, that the Roman Generals and Com-
manders uted, in their Triumphs, to prefent a Crown of Laurel to
Tupiter Capitelinus.
The ancient Remans allo uled to bellow a Palm on thofe who tri-
umphed, as a general Token of Victory. And the Patmtree, thot
preffed by an heavy Weight, will yet grow againtt it; wherefore, in
hot Battles, tis effeemed a Token of Victory, which can only be got
by a firm Refolution to refift and despife Dangers and Adverlicies.
The Olive is likewife a Mark of Victory; the Ancients adorning
their Trophies and warlike Monuments with its Branches, or decking
the Head of the Conqueror with a Crown of its Leaves.
The gold Cbain was the Reman Reward for Valour and Virtue; it
not only recompenfing Merit, but ferving for a Badge of Honour,
Glory and ERleem. The Roman Hiffory informs us, that the Son of
Tarquiniss Prifcas, tho' but 14 Vears of Age, charged the Enemies in
the open Field, and conquer’d them; wherefore, to immortalize his
Valour, he was the firft who was honour’d with a gold Cbain: Tho,,
according to others, Herphias, the firft Son born of the ravith’d Sa=
bines at Rome, firft received that Honour. We alfo read, that Sicin
nias Dentatus was 67 Times rewarded with a gold Chain, and 25. Times
with other Gold or gill Prefents.
The Heart befet with precious Stones, hanging down to the Breaft.
on a gold Chain, fignifies, that wholfome Advice and Deliberation (pring:
from the innermoff of the ffeart; wherefore, thofe who triumph:
ed were introduced with this gold Chain about their Necks, in the ur-

The gold Crown and Bracokets, which adorned both the Shoulders
and Arms, were likewife the Rewards of great Attions. Thole Gife
were preferved for Pofterity, as a Spur for young People indefatigably
to gread in the Steps of their Fore -fathers. Firas Liviss, in his roch
Book, fays, that, after the Viltory obtained over the Samnites near
Aquilonis, Papiriss, on that Occafion, prefented Sp. Nautins, his Ne
phew, Seariss Pabiriss, 4 Captains and a Troop of Pikemen, with
Bracelets and gold Crowns; giving the other Captains, Foot-foldiers and
Horfemen, Brocelets and Ornaments of Silver which they called Cor.
mrals, of little Horns And Decins the Tribune received a gold Crown
from Aulss Cornelias Coffus, for defending a certain ffrong Place, be
longing to the Remans, againff the Samires, and forcing them to raife
the Siegc.
The Romans allo efteemed the Kings as Badges of Honour and No.
bility- For, according to Titas Livius, in his chird Book, treating of
the second Panic War, on Mlago's being difparch’d by Hannibal to no
tify to the Carthaginians the bloody Defeat of the Romans in the
Battle of Canns, he poured out before them an Heap of gold Kings,
taken as Booty from the Stain; adding, to excol the Viltory, that,
among the Romins, none but the Great and Noble were allowed to
wear them. And, towards the Clofe of his 9th Book, he relates,
that on Flaviss his being in a publick Affembly, cholen Edilis, of
Superintendant of the publick Buildings, the Nobiliry were to ditfult
od, that feveral of them laid down their gold Kings and Other Tokens
of Honour and Effeem. And the eloquent Cicere, in his ith Oration
againft Verres, reproaches him for beflowing, in a publick Affembly of
the People, the Tokens of Honour, Gold Kings, on mean and unworthy
People: With whom agrees Afconins, faying, That the Fasces, Civc
Crown and gold Rings were, by the People, look’d on as Badges of Li
berty and Nebilicy, and always actended with Honour and profitable
Incomes.
The Greeks repured the Hat or Cap as a Token of noble Extrac
tion; wherefore they reprefented the Head of Ulilfes covered with a
Cop of Hor, as being noble both by Father and Mother. For this
Reafon, we commonly fee on the ancient Coims and Medals an Hat of
Cag, circomsribed LiBERT AS.
The Dismond is indifputably the hardeff, and, for its (parkling, the

The embreider’d Goat, called Tunica Palmata, was an UUnder-gar-

The Romans, and some of the Greeks, took the 4x Hlieroglyphically

in this Table we exhibit a Plaifter-figure of Mercury winged at

Cedar and Myrtle, and the third of Oak-leaves. On the Wall, or
in a fmall Table, we fee, in Bass relief, the Fable of Minerva brought
forth out of Tupiter's Brain.
Explanation of the Objects.
Mercury implies the impreffion of Words upon the Mind, and the
Force of Eloquence: Wherefore, the Ancients believ’d, he was the
Meffenger and Incerpreter of the Gods.
The Square-flone whereon he flands fignifies the Regard for and Sta-
bility of the Laws and Rules whereby to direlt our Speeches: For
which Reafon Mercury is Hiled Tetragenus, or Square, that is firm and
certain.
His Staff or Caducens intimates, that obltinate Tyrants mult yield
to the Laws and fluent Charms of Eloquence. By the Serpents tuined
about the golden Rod the Ancients mean, that Eloquence, temper’d with
Ingenuity and Prudence, can cafily bring Men to Reafon. Some alfo
would have the golden Rod in the Hand of Mercury to lignity, the Ex-
cellence and Eminence of honourable Offices due to thole who imploy
their Eloquence (the Gift of Heaven) in their Neighbours Welfare and
the common Good.
By the Olive-branch in Mercury's Hand is underfood, Peace; for
the ncients believed, it compoted the Differences of contending Parties.
His Wings at Head and Feet were aftigned him to fignify, the Readi-
nets and Force of Eloquence.

rior thereby defends himself and annoys his Enemy, to a Council gets
his Caule by the Dint of frong Arguments and well grounded Con.
clutions.
The ancient Romans fignified, by the Lyre or Harg, a Man of great
Learning and Judgment; for that Inftrument is compofed of divers
Strings and Scunds, producing fine Harmony; like the Lawyer when
he reconciles the Difference of Things to Reafon, in order to make con-
teking Parties agree. By the Harg or Lyre, we alfo underlland,
that Harmony arifes from different and diffonant Cords; and
that People of contrary Sentiments meeting together, may, by
a good Union, ferle and trantmit to Pofterity an excellent Form of
Government. And as Plate, in his Timans, fliles the Soul a Concert or
tweer Harmony, to Concord may be juftly call’d, the Soul of the State.
The Greets and Romans fay, the Lyre was partly invented by Alercury
and parrly by others.
The Shape of the ancient Lyre is this: It was bent like two Horms,
join’d together, having a fwelling Belly, and on cop an Handle. 1i is
said to have had but three Strings, and thefe could produce feven
Tunes, making a perfed Harmony. The three Strings were affigned
in lmitation of the three Scafons of the Vear Known to the Eoyptians,
212. Summer, Uinter and Spring, each confifting of four Months; and
they artribured the Canras to the Summer, the Bass to Winter and the
Ire5s to the Spring. Others fay, that this Application respects Man;
whole Body, confitting of four Elements, and the Soul, in reference to
its Acts, of three, thus makes the Number feven; which together

is, Plus Oli quam Vini; He spint mere in Oilthan Wine; meaning

By the Sieve, the fame People hicroglyphically meant; the Fruitful.

Bad, to their Lawyers, who were alto Hiled Prielts, Knew how, thro'
their Prudence and Wifdom, to diffinguish between Things concerning
Life and Death; accordingly, they made ufe of the Word Sieve for
exprefting whats true and known. Others fay, that by that Imple.
ment is fignified, a Man of great Knowledge and Perfection, who can
difcourfe of Things divine and human with equal Penetration. More.
over, as the sieve feparates the Flour from the Bran, fo Experience
fits us for difcerning between good and bad, right and wrong. Where-
fore Virgil, in the firft Book of his Georgies, righily files it, Myffica
Vannus lacchi, the myftic Fan (or Sieve) of laccbus. Some apply to
this Point the Saying of the Philofopher Antifiberes; that it were
great Folly not to know how to diffinguith the Corn from the Chaff;
meaning the learned and beneficial Citizens from the illiterate.

The Herb or Plower Iris is an Emblem of Eloquence, according to
Hemer, who, to defcribe that of the Trejan Embaffadors, reprefents
them as having eaten the blooming Iris; meaning, their being the.

of Colours, is not unlike the heavenly Iris of Rainbow, whom the
Ancients accounted the Goddets of Eloquence.

we muff not forget the fruitful Muffard-feed, a Sprig whereof we have

Adamamins and others tell us, that the Power of the Univerfe

Bible is unneceffary, fince it is fufficiently known to every Body.
The Altar is accounted the Hicroglyphic of Piety; of which, I
have treated in Book IN. pas. 493, 494.
Plutarch compares the Lamp to the Body, the Habitation of the
Soul; and its sbining Ligbt to the Faculy of Underllanding. But in
Scripture, we often find, that by the Lamp are meant the Doctors and
Teachers of Arts, Sciences and Myleries, who should be fet on the Can-
dlefick, in order to expel Darkness, and light thefe in the Houfe. In
another Paltage, it's faid, that the Light ought not to be bidden, &c.
And if the Light, according to Scholafticus in his Climax, come to be
in Darknels, what will not the Darknefs of Nature, or Men ignorant
of God, be guitty of ? Some again underftand by the Light, the Goffel:
Others, St. John the Baptiff, who is alto called, a burning Lamp.
The Prophets were alfo Lamps, but burning dim, as (peaking myfte-
rioufly: Bur St. John, as with a Finger, has pointed out our Saviour.
Eucherins obferves, that by the Lamp is fometimes meant, good
Works; and therefore the Gofpel lays, — Let yoar Light fo shine
before Men, that they may fee your geod Werks, &c. The Light or
Fire fometimes likewife hieroglyphically fignifies, Devotion and Piety.
Hearthly Things can in any wife unite us with the heavenly, no-
thing in Nature has greater Affinity with the Mind and Spirt than
Fire, becaufe it lights and clears every thing, and makes us intimate
with Heaven.

For, by our Saviour's Coming on Earth, we have learnt what the Fleh
and Spirit incline to; and his Doltrine has, like a trvo-edged Sword,
divided the Spirit from the Fleth, that we might afterwards lead a
fpirirual Life, as being not in the Fleth, but in the Spirit, efteeming
the Corruption of the Fleth a great Gain, when, thro' the Spirit, we
obtain eternal Life.
Eacherius thinks, that the Words in Pl. Cxxvil.— As Arrows are
in the Hand of a mighty Man, fo are the Children of the Touth, allude
to the Apofiles and their Miffion into all Countries; becaute, in their
Travels, they pierced Men's Hearts with the Doltrine of Chriff, as with
2 durting frrow, and brought them from Darkness to Light: For
by the frrows, in feveral Places of Scripture, is underftood Gods
Word, penetrating the Soul as with a twoedged Sword.
We find in facred Writ, that the Almighty is to be praited with
Drans or Timbrels. And Gregory, in the 6th Book of his Epitilesto

of Orpbins and Proclas among the Heathens, and Dovid among the
Yeas, have powerfully incited to Piety and good Living.
By Water and Fire, or the Ciffern and Cenfer, the EEgyptian Prielts
underffood a Purgation from Spots and Filth; even from the Darknels
of Igaorance by Means of pure Doctrine. Accordingly, after Fune-
rals, the Ancients purified themfelves with Water and fmoking Per-
fumes, the latter hieroglyphically reprefenting Prayers and divine Doc-
rine, as Hefychins Bishop of Terusalem writes.
The fame People meant by the Sieve the Fruitfulness of Inftruction
in Arts and Sciences. Others, the End of all Things, as by ofcen exa-
mining ourtelves to learn Quietness of Life, and by due Reffection on
what is paft, prefent and to come, to make Profperity and Adverfity
equal.
Dodrine and Inftruction those People called S Bo. which, being
interpreted, fignifies Plenty, or all that is necelfary for Life;
as it the Study of Sciences require a good Forcune. Ariffotle fays,
the Rich should Rudy Philofophy. And Eechariab, a noted Man,
among the Fews, — If you have Flour, you will learn the Law:
1f you have Knowledge in the Law, you will vant no Flour: The Law
implying Knowledge and Sciences, and the Flour every Thingnecelfary
for Suftenance. But I think, according to REgyprian Wildom, that
this Dotrine rather respects the Soul than the Body; for its believed,
that the Basket of unleavend Bread, which Haron and his Sons only
were to offer, hicroolyphically fignitied the Tongue or Word, or eter-
nal and heavenly Eloquence; for as Brend fuppores the Body, fo the
Word of God nourifhes to eternal Life. And becaule Bread, by a ge-
peral Confent, implies Doctrine and Inftruction; to whom muft we re-
turn our Thanks, but to him who by his Doctrine has enlightened our
Urderllanding, and is the Fountain of Plenty and Perfection. In this
Seate the Bread, called the Loaves of two Tenth-deals of fine Flour,.
offer’d, as in Leviticus xxii. for a Meatoffering, fignitied the Law and.
the Gofpel; but according to our Saviour when under Temptation, that
a Man did not live by Bread alone, but by every Word preceeding out of
the Mouth of God.
in Baking, the Leoven has in Scripture divers Sigaifications: Among
others it implies human Sciences. Now Sciences are divided into bu-

are endlets; and thus Nature, Philofophy, Ethies and Thcology are
very comformable to the Deiry: But Grammar, Rhccorick, and Dis-
lettica are call’d human Sciences: Wherefore, fays Origines, the Lea-
yin is not used in Offerings. For Divines underfland by it, human Sci-
ences, the Matter and Force whereof lies only in Words; which ne-
verthelets are Ards, becaute the Purity of Speech, which Grammar
reaches, thews the Beauty and Excellence of Eloquence obtained by
Rhetorick, and the Merhod of Reafoning and Oppofition, gained by
Dialectica, is an Help to many other Sciences.
Philolophers fay, that the Products of the Earth are owing to Sult.
Divines compare it to the Colpel, alledging Leriticus, Chap. 2. Wilh
oll thine Offerings they salt offer Satt: Or in all your Doctrines you
mult be governed by thofe of the Apoftles, who, according to our
Saviour, are the Salt of the Earth. The Frankincenfe put on the 12

The Tewish Prielts were commanded to fet the People a Pattern of

molt facred and myfferious Doltrine, by which they ought to govern
chemfelves and their Congregations. Tcremiah’s Girdle had the same
Micaning, as Cirif largely thews. As the Girdle was white Linnes,
we are led to confider the firft Matter it was made of, to wit
Flax.
The Seed of Flix comes up as green as Grass in a short Time alta

one Point, fo the Soul ought to be elevated towards God. Thus
Divines are rightly compar’d to a Wheel; that, by fortaking earchly
Thoughts, their Convertacion should always be in Heaven.
The Sapphire was always in great Elleem, as emblemitically re-
prefenting Sovereignty and Pricilhood. Some fay, that this Stone
draws heavenly influences from Tupiter and Saturn; and that thofe
who wear it obtain all their Defires; as from Tupiter, Dominion and
Auchority, and from Sarurn, the Prieithood. But, according to the
Fathers, this Stone reprefents the Throne fpoken of by Exetiel,
to wit, the Seat of God, eternal, good and Almighty. And Eucbe-
riss underllands, by the Make of the Heavens, the Society of the
Pious and Elect: Wherefore, fays Heficbins, the Throne of Sapphire
lignifies the tenth of Empyreal Heaven: For by the Colour he under-
Rands, Purity, Clearnels and heavenly Light, always intlrulting the
Church in unalterable and pure Doctrines.
We learn from Scripture, that the Olive-free was originally the Em-
blem of Peace; for no fooner did the Waters abate, but the the Dove,
which Noah fent, foon after returned with an Olive-teaf, as a Token
that the Wrath of Heaven being appeared, God took Compaftion on
the Remains of human Race and other Creatures in the Ark, and
therefore cauted the Waters to retire into the Bowels of the Earth.
The Olivebranch is alfo, in Scripture, the Emblem of a pious Min;
swe fee in the Gofpel, that the Light ought to burn pure on the Can-
deffick, whereby our Saviour intimates, that both Preachers and Hear-
ers should fill their Lamps with the Oil of Chriflian Virrues. The
fime Tree, for its continual Verdure, is allo taken for the Emblem of
Hope; accordingly, Baplins with’d we might be like it, becaufe, a-
bounding with Bloffoms and Thining Greenness, if always affords
Hope of what is to come; or the durable Prairs of Piety and Mercy.

facred Things, otherwife than by means of their Specches. Affer
this, they enquired into natural Philofophy, or Phyficks, having, for
Subject, the Univerfe and all created Beings; this Science clear’d their
Doubis and Scruples, and prepar’d them for contemplating the glorions
Baiiding of the Heavens, in order to thank their Creator for the

foll of Men, divides it into three Sciences, to wit, Esbies, Phyfies,
and Metaphyfies, which he has handled in his Proverts, Ecclepaffes,
and Song or Carlicam Canticerum; reaching in the Troverbs, moral
Obligations; in Ecclefsaffes, the Nature of Things; and in his Song,
the Contemplation of Things lupernatural. This seems well to agree
with the Mention in Scripture of the Ged of Abrabam, Hact and Ta-
1ob: For Abrabams obeying God in all Things thews an Example of
moral Duries; Iaac’s digging Wells and fearching the Depths of the
Earth, fignifies Thyfies, or natural Philofophy; and Jacet's Dream
of the Ladder, and the Afcent and Defcent of the Angels thereon, the
Contemplation of divine Things. Both the Hebrew, Greek and La-
tin Divines have largely handled this Subject. Even the Elements
seem to inculcate this Doctrine: For the Earth, Water and Air, by
their wonderful Conjunction reprefent the different Degrees of the Ser-
eaces: The Earth and Moifture implying the Hiffory of Things, as a
Teacher of moral Duries: The Waters, diffurbed by the Winds,
thew the Turmoils happening in human ctions, which Esbies ferve
toallay; the Air admonithes, that, at length railing the whole Force of
our Thoughts upwards, we ought continually to contemplare the di-
vine Nature, call’d by the Greeks, Tbheologia, which is the Top and
Limit of our Underffanding. We fay nothing here of Dialetfica, be-
caule it is fubfervient to Eibies, Plyfics and Theelory, in order to dif
courfe of thofe three Sciences.
By the equilateral Triangle we lignity, the Him and Purpofe of an

Heathens, called Iritonia, as having the Care of impartial Juffice.

The Gedar-tree, as yielding excellent and ufeful Fruit, is the Em-

James: Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this.
to visst the Fatherless and Widows in their Afffictions, and to keep him-

We read in the Pfalms, that from the springing Waters of Irael
comes forth the Praise of the Lord in the Congregation of the Saints. By
which, Divines underftand the Books of the Law and Prophets, which.
as Springs of living Waters, lupplied the Ifractites with the Knowledge
of God, and being fill’d with his Spirit, their holy Men compoted
Hymas to the Glory of his Name. Several Commentators on Scrip-
ture and illuftrious Inftruments of the Church would fignify, by the
Poringing Waters the Apolties and firft Teachers; and Eathymins and
the primitive Fathers, the Preaching of the Golpel. And David, in
Pf. cv. Cays, He fends the Springs into the Valleys, wbich run among the
Hills; they give Drink to every Beaft of the Field: Thereby intimaring
that no Place is to hilly or unattainable, which God's Law cannot pes

Writers mention, that the Elephans (who is known to be the mofl

according to Hegecius, Mlen taken up with the Contemplation of divine

C H AP. IV. Of the Origin, Nature and Quality of the Roman
Triumphal Crowns, and other Rewards of Honeur.
T E learn from Hillory, how noble the ancient Romans were in
gratifring the Virtue, Valour and Conduct of their Citizens,
Solfiers and Commanders, belides their ordinary Pay, with Triumphal
Crowns, Jewels and other Prefents, as an Example to others to tread
in the same Steps, for the Good of their Country. And we judge
this Point very proper to be handled next to Still lfe, as it will con
duce to make the embleratick Sense of a good Piece more perfelt.
After a Commander had gained either a great Advantage or Viltory
orer the Enemy, in a Siege, Battle or Sea-fight, he, according to
Cultom, made an exalt Inquiry, what Perfons had behaved with the
greateft Valour and Refolution; and then, placing himfelf on a Stage
raifed for thar Purpote, and returning Thanks to the Gods for the Vic
fory obtained, he commended the Army in general for their fleady
Adherence, and each Company in particular which had shewed the great
off Courage: Then. naming them one after another, he extoll’d their
Valour, ftiling them Friends and Lovers of their Country, and telling
them how highly ther obliged the Common wealth by their Loyaly
and brave Behaviour: And thereupon, in the Name of the Senate, he di
ftribured among them many rich Prefents, confifting of Crowns of Gold
and Silver, Girdles, Gold Chains, Bracelets, Kings for Ears and Fir
gers, Armour, Shiclds, Pikes, Swords, Javelins, Standards, fine Horfe
furniture, and other elegantly wrought warlike Inftruments; which
hone durff ufe or wear but thofe who had purchafed them in the Manner
aforefaid. The Romas Story abounds with fuch Occurrences, but especially
Titus Livins, who relates, that the Conful Papirius Curfor bellowed
Gold Bracelets among 4co Men, and afterwards magnificently rewart
ed a whole Legion. He tells us the tame Things of Scipio, when he
waged. War in Spain and other Countries. And we read, tha
LaTAs Antonius, Son of Lucius Fabins Quadiatus, was twice dignitied
by the Emperor Tiberins, with Gold Ornaments for the Neck and
ArtIs.
Bur beides the native Valour and milicary Difcipline, for which the
ancient Romans were particularly famous, we learn from Pliny and St

linss, that ofcentimes a fingle Perfon by his Virtue and Valour obtained
all the aforelaid Ornaments; as we fee in Marcus Sergins, who received
almoll all those Tokens of Honour, and even in the Baules of Tbrass-
menus and Trebia, and the bloody one at Canns; (in all which, the
Remans were defeated by Hannibal) he obtain’d a Civit Crown. Tis
related of this Sergins, that, having in Battle loff his right Hand, and
fixed an ironone in its Place, he to managed his left, as, in one Day, to
day 4 armed Men one after another; and that in Fights and Skirmithes,
he had received 23 Wounds in the Fore-parts of his Body. And yet this
Man is inferior to Lucins Sicinnias Dentatus, Overfeer of the City of
Rome; of whom Pliny, Selinus, Valerius Maximus and Aulus Gellins
unanimoutly report, that his great Merit had gained him, from the Se-
nate, above 220 honorary Prefents of all Sorts, and that he 9 times
made his Entrance in Triumph with the Generals whom, by his Va
lour and Conduct, he had affifted in their Conquelts; and that he could
thew a great Number of Lances and Pikes, uniron’d, which, as to
many Tokens of Honour, fell to his Share; as allo, 18 gold and 83
filver Neckornaments, 25 coflly Horfe-furnitures, 140 Bracelets, 14
Civic Crowns, 8 Caftrenfes, z Mural, 7 Obfidional, and 1 know not
how many Navalor Roffral Crowns. He had received 45 Wounds, and
thofe in his Fore-parts only; difarmed the Enemy z4 times, and fought
120 Bartles. In a Word, he was filed the Roman Acbilles.
The Crowns, bellow’d on Men of particular Merit, had Degrees of
Dignity, and particular Names fuiting the Nature of the Victories;
2s, Corona Obpdionalis, Civica, Triumphalis, Ovalis, Muralis, Navalis
and Castrensis.
The Corong Obsidionalis, or Obfidional Crown, was the moft excellent
of all; for when a Roman Town or Camp, befieged and reduced to
Extremity, was relieved by a Reman Captain, the Common-wealth
rewarded the Action in the moft noble Manner, viz. with the afore-
said Crown and a Triumph. This Crown, tho' made of Grass, was
accounted of higher Worth than if of Gold and enrich’d with precious
Stones: The Grass was pull’d up in the Field of Bartle; wherefore this
Crown is faid to be facred to Mars, (which Boccatins feems to af-
firm) poffibly becaute the Grass grows mofly in open Places and
Fields of Encampment. The great Quintus Fabius was, in Reward of
his Merit, by the general Confent of the Senace and Roman People,
honour’d with this Crown, when, in the 2d Panic War, he delivered
the City from the approaching Ruin and Excremity which Hannibal
had brought it to. Emilius ucipie had the fame Cifi in Africa, for

refining the Conful Mlanhas and his Forces out of the Power of the
Enemy. Calpurnias obrain’d the fame Honour in Sicity; as did allo
the incomparable Lycius Sicinmis Dentatus.
The Corons Civics, or Civic Crown, was given to him who had pre-
ferved a Roman Citizen from imminent Danger, or releafed from Cap
Evitr. This Crown was made of Oak Sprigs and Leaves with the
Frut hanging at it, and, by the General’s Order, who gave it to the
Perton fet ar Liberty, pur on the Deliverer's Head. But tho' a Perfon
had fived a King or other great Ally of the Romans from falling into
the Enemies Hands, yer he got not this Crown, which was only due to
him who had freed a Roman Citizen from Death or Slavery. Pling
firs, this Crown was allo prefented to him who flew the firft of the
Exemy befieging a Reman Town. It was the ext in Dignity to the
Corms OEplionalis, and worn on feveral Occations; especially on the
great Fellivals and Solemnires; and in the Plays and other publick
Sports thofe who were honour’d with it fat next to the Senate, and, at
their Entrance, were received by them with all the Marks of Resped.
Thete Perfons, with their Fathers and Grandfathers, were entirely ex-
empied from all Charges and Taxes, as having begor Sons to beneticial
to the Common wealch; they were allo ar Liverry to accept or refule
publick Offices. Several Romins obtain’d this Honour, efpecially the
aforelaid valiant Lucias Sirinnius Dentatus, who 14 times gloried in it;
as Capitelinus did lix. The brave Marcus Sergins likewile received it
from the Genare, and, in a Word, all thofe, who, in an extraordinary
Manner, had beneirced the Ciry or Country. The famous Cicere was
to crown’d by a paracular Decree of the Senate, for having happily
deliver’d the City from the imminent Danger of the Catiline Confpiracj.
Thefe Crowns, tho' feemingly fimple, as being made of Grats and
Sprigs of Trees, were yet of greater Account than thole of Gold and
Sewels. They were of Ork, becaute the Acorn was the moft ancient
Food, and becaute that Tree was facred to Tupiter the Tucclargod
The Viltors, in the Capiteline Games, inflitured by Domitian, as allo
Stage-players, Muficians and Poets were likewile crowned with Ort-
Ieaves.
The Corons Triumphalis, or Triumphal Crown, was given to the
General who, having overthrown the Enemy in a pitche Bartle, had
thereby either faved a Roman Ally, or annexed some Dominion to the
Common-wealth; wherefore he was alfo introduced into the City in
Triumph, riding in a gill Chanot drawn by four or, according to fome,
fix whice Horfes. This Crown was made of Laurel, facred to Apals

for its Greenness and red Berriss, and fignified, that the Viltory is at-
cended with much Trouble, Danger and Bloodfhed. Serrys relates,
that the Soldiers ufed to follow the Charior of the Conqueror, allo
crowned with Laurel, to purify them, on entring the City, from the
Blood of the Slain. By the Suffrage of the Senate, the Victors in the
Wreftting Games were honourd with the fame Crown: And it was an
ciently given to Meneminent for heroic Poetry and Eloquence: Where
fore Hefied tays, Tbe Mafes had beflow’d on him a Scepter and Crown of
Lourel. The Roman Priekts and South-fayers likewile crowned them
felves with Laurel: Even thofe who follow’d the Army wore a Sprig
of it on their Helmets, inflead of a Feather, becaute the Tree was ac
counted and called by them a fore-telling one.
The Corona Ovalis, (given to a General, of other prime Perton,
who had beaten the Enemy with little Refiftance, or, having undertook
the War without the express Command of the Senate, had gained
some confiderable Fortrets, Town or Place) was made of Myrcle-
leaves, a Tree facred to tenus. This Crown denoted, that the War
was carried on without great Bloodthed; and therefore publick Rejoic-
ings were made for it, but without much Triumph. When a Victory
was gained over Slaves, or Pyrates and Robbers, the Victors had the
same Sort of Crowns, becaute fuch Enemies were judged unworthy of
feeling the Reman Valour. The principal Generals who obtained this,
and the triumphal Crown aforelaid, I shall mention among the Tri
Umphs.
The Corong Muralis, or Mural Crown, was the Reward of a Sol-
dier or Officer, who, in affaulcing a Town of the Enemy, firll advanced
2 Ladder, and valiancly mounted the Walls, and made Way for Con-
quell. This Crown was of Gold, reprefenting the Bartlements of the
Town wall they had conquerd; or elfe being like that which the
Poets afcribe to Cybele, the Mother of the Gods, or Mother Earth.
Round it were engraven Lyons, the Emblems of Valour and Genero-
fity. Suctonius relates, that common Soldiers received it, as well as
Captains and Generals, on a publick Tellimony from others, that they
hill gained the Top of the Enemies Walls. Manlius Capitelinus was.
according to Pliny, firft honoured with this Crown. And Scipie gave
it to 2. Trebellins and Sextas Digitas, on their jointly firft mounting
the Enemies Walls.
The Corona Navalis, or Naval Crown, was given to him who, in
2 Sea-engagement, firff entred into an Enemy's Ship, and made him-
telf Maffer of it. This Crown was allo of Gold, and its Circle fet

The fame Crown was the Prefent of the ancient Atbenians to thofe
who firted our Ships of War for the publick Service, or firft landed
and increnched on the Enemy's Ground.
The Romans, in Process of Time, placed an Hedge-hog on the Cir
cle of this Crown, becaufe that Creature's Defence lying in his Skin,
wherein he rolls himself up, he was effcemed the Emblem of a Sea-
fight. This Crown is afcribed to Diana, or the Moon, as the influ-
eaces the Sea, and its Floods.
The Corona Cafrensss was given, by the chief Commander, to him,
who, in Battle, firft enter’d the Enemy's Camp. This Crown was 2
Gold Circle, to which were affixed Palifades of the same Metal. They
alto had it who firlt deffroy’d the Palifades of the Enemy, and there.
by open’d a Door for Viltory. This Crown was the Reward of a
great Number of Romans in thofe Times of Valour.
Belides thefe Degrees of Honour, the Remans beltowed feveral Pri-
vileges on thofe who excell’d in warlike Archievements, cauling them,
in the publick Pleadings, to fir in the Sella Curaks, or the Preforslvory
Chair; as we read of the great Scipie: And, it often happen’d, fince
all Things center’d in the Voice and Confent of the People, that some
of the Soldiery were invefted with greater Power and Privileges. All
Generals, who, by Conquelt, had enlarged the Empire, were allowed
to fet up their Starues in the Confular Dress. Augytus, to eremize
the Memories of all fuch Generals as had angmented the State, or
dained, that, next to the Gods, the firtt Veneracion should be paid to

Proclamation, that he did this for himfelf and Succeffors, as an Exam
ple to Pofterity to imitate the Virrues and Valour of fuch illufrious
Perfonages. Moreover, it was a laudable and conflant Cuffom of the
Senate, to affign the Children of fuch as fell in Barcle, the liberal
Enjoyment of the Pay of their deceafed Parents; and to the old and
maimed Soldiers, as many Lands, in the Provinces they conquerd, as

would comfortably support them and their Families for the Remainder
of their Lives. On this Fooring, the Ciry of Seville in Spain, and the
fruitful Country round it were made a Reman Colony by Tulius Cafar;
and Cordaba and feveral other Places in divers Parts of the World were
applied to the same Purpote. In a Word, Roman Services never mils’d
a Reward; and, for this Reafon, that Common-wealth produced more
brave Men than any other Nation whatfoever; every one exerting
himself to attain all the Degrees of Honour by the Hricteff Virtue.
But, on the other hand, the vicious and cowardly were, in Proportion
to their Offences, as feverely punith’d, either by Deprivation of their
honourable Offices and facure Hopes, or elfe by being whipp’d with
Rods till the Blood came, or loaden with lrons and made Slaves. 7i.
tas Livius relates, that a Troop of Appins Claudins, cowardly defert-
ing a certain Poll which they were fet to guard, was rigoroully pu-
nith’d, by every tenth Man's being put to Death, according to Lot, with-
out Relpett of Perfons. Julius Frontinus writes, that Marcus Anto-
nits cauted a certain Troop, who had not duly defended a Town-wall
and Fortification, to undergo the fame Fate. There were many other
Methods for punithing the Difobedience of the Roman Soldiery, which
Ihall pats by, and conclude with Horace.

WO Motives generally incite a Man to do great Things, either
in Times of Peace or War; to wir, Honour and immortal
Fame, or Riches and Profit. Generous Souls always aspire at the for-
mer, and rejell the latter, as below them. The Roman Governmment
knew perfeltly well how to make its Advantage of thefe inducements,
in the Encouragements given to its Subjects; and we shall begin with

the Triumphs, by which they honour’d and roured the Valour of
their Heroes
The Triumph was an Entrance and Welcome of a General, by De-
cree of the Senate, after an happy Expedition and the Conclution of a
War, whereby, in the moff folemn and pompous Manner, they thew.
ed him their great Elteem. On the Day of Entry, the Inhabitants of
all the Towns flock’d to Rome, and the whole City, Temples, Streets,
Gates, Houfes and Windows were hung with all Sorts of coftly Stulls,
in Gold, Silver, and Silk, and beautifully deckt with great Variety of
green Branches and Flowers. in a Word, nothing was wanting to
thew either the Power, Magnificence or Joy of the Romans, on this
Occation. The Senate, Clergy, Nobility and moft eminent Citizens
and therefore the greatef Part of Rome) richly dreft, met the Con
queror without the Towngates. He far in an Ivory Chair, called Se.
des Curalis, in a Gold Chariot (parkling with precious Scones, and
drawn either by four or fix whice Horfes magnificently equipt; and
was drelt in a Garment of Purple and Gold, called Toga Patmars,
crown’d with Lrel, and the Staff of Command in his Hand, or elfe
a winged lmage of Vittery, holding a Crown of Laurel or a Palm
branch. Someimes this Figure was placed behind him, holding in its
right Hand a Crown of Laurel over his Head, as we fee it both Ways
in the ancient Bassreliefs and Medals. The Prifoners of War, dref
like Slaves, and with fhorn Heads, and the King or General, with the
moff eminent of the Vanquith’d, were led in fercer’d Couples before
the Chariot; which the Roman Legions followed, in Troops or Com
panies, on Foor and Horfe-back, in their Order, richly arm’d, and
with their Pikes and Lances twined with Laurel, as a Token of general
Joy: But they who had moft fignalized themfelves in Valour, marchd
on each side of the Charior, with Crowns of Laurel on their Heads,
and Palm-branches in their Hands. Before the Conqueror went like
wife fome Carriages laden with the Arms, Banners, Gold and Silver
Vafes, Jewels and all Sores of Gold and Silver Coin, taken as Booy
from the Enemy; together with the Gifts and Prefents he had received
from the Friends and Allies of the Romans. Next came some Callles
and Towers of Wood, elegantly carved, refembling the Towns and
Fortreffes gained of the Enemy. In their Pallage, the rmy feigged
some Battles, in to lively a Manner as thereby to affect the Spectaios
with all Sorts of Paffions, as Corrow, Joy, and Fright. The Vaney
of thefe Sights was to great and exceffive as to fpin out the Cavalcade
for three or four Days; and being arrived at the Capirel, all the Arms

and Beoty, called Manubia, taken from the Enemy, were hung up and
depofited in the Temple of Tupiter, as an eternal Mlemoria of the
Virtue of the Conquerors Here the Senate return’d them Thanks for
the Service done to their Country, and, commonly chuling the Victor
25 a Coadjutor in the Government, the Joy concluded with a magnifi-
cent Entertainment. But, for forming a better Idea of thefe Tri-
umphs, and the Order therein obferved, I shall, as far as my Mc-
mory will permit, give fome Examples of them out of the Roman
Hiffories.
Plutarch defcribes the Triumph vored to Paulus Emilins, for
his Viltory over the Great Perfens, King of Macedoma, in this
Manner.
Firfl, the People of Rome and the neighbouring Towns, magnifi-
cently drell, appeard at the Doors and Windows, in the Balconies,
Carrets and on Tops of Houles, in great Mulcitudes, as Speclators of
the Soletmnity. All the Temples in Rome, richly adorned, were fet
open. The Houfes and Streets were wonderfully garnith’d with all
Sorts of collly Hangings and fill’d with Greens, Flowers, choice Per-
fames, and a thouland other fine and delightful Things. And as the
Concourfe of People was very great, Alen with Staves were appointed
to make and preferve a Lane or Pallage thro' them, for the March of
the Triumphers. The firft Day was spent in the Proceltion of the
Baaners, Standards, Enligns, Statues, Coloffes, Pictures and Figures,
all placed on Carriages elegantly painted, and flowly driven. The fe-
cond Day was taken up with the Paffage of the bright Armour of the
ranquith’d King and Macedonians, placed on neat Chariots or Carri-
ages made for that Purpofe. To thefe fucceeded g000 Mcn, partly
carrying the Gold and Silver Coin in 2g0 large Silver Dithes and Vales,
each weighing three Talents, and carried by four Men. The Re-
mainder of thefe Men bore Fountains and Rately Vafes of Silver, art-
fully wrought. On the third Day appear’d the firft Company, pre-
ceded by a great Number of Pipers, Drums, Hautboys and Trum
Pets, making a warlike Mulic as if preparing for an Onfet. Thefe
were followed by 120 Cows, deckt with gile Horns and facred Linnen
Coverings, aid all Sorts of green Garlands wreath’d with Flowers, led,
for Viltims, by beautiful young Men richly dreft, and fucceeded by a
Company of Children carrying Gold and Silver Dithes, for the Ufe of
the Sacrifice. After thefe, came the Bearers of the Gold Vafes with
Gold Coin, in Number 72, followed by feveral great Officers of the
Aetinue of Antigohus and Seleucus, late Kings of Macedonia, and even
of

of Perfeas himself, carrying the exceffive large Gold Veffel, weighing
ten Talents, and curich’d with all Sores of precious Stones and Dis-
monds, which was made by Emiliss's exprets Order. Next to thefe
appeard the Body-chariot of the conquer’d King, and therein his Coat
of Arms, Diadem, or Royal Headband, Crown and Scepter. Then
followed the Children of the unhappy Prince, attended by a great
Number of his Courtiers, as Stewards, Secretaries and other such Do-
meftics, weeping and lamenting their Slavery in fuch a Manner as,
confidering the Vicifficude of human Affairs, to raife Compaftion in the
Spectators; especially the Sight of the three innocent Children, two
Sons and a Daughter, who, by Reafon of their tender Age, were in
tentible of their unhappy Condition. After thefe appeared the Father,
drell in Black, according to the Cultom of his Country, and walking
full of Terror and Concern on this Occafion. Next to him came his
Friends, Favourites, and Confidents, who, fixing their Eyes on him,
and birterly weeping, mov’d many of the Romans themfelves, with
Tears in their Eyes, to pity both their and the King's forrowful Condi=
tion. To thefe fucceeded the Gold Crowns which the ancient free Ci
ties had pretented to the Conqueror, as a Gratulation for his Viltory:
And then came Enilias himfelf, fitting on a Gold triumphal Charict,
drelt in a purple Garment richly wrought with Gold, with a Laurel
branch in his Hand, and a Crown of the fame on his Head. He was
follow’d by the Army, Horfe and Foor, orderly marthall’d under their
proper Erfigae, having Garlands of Laurel and Palmbranches in their
Hands, and linging Hymns in Praife of the Viltor and Victory. Thus
Prtius Enilius made his triumphal Entrance into the famous City
of Rove, whee he offer’d the Booty in the Temple of Tupitir
Capirolinas, and returned the God Thanks for his Viltory and
Triumph.
All other Triumphs were manag’'d much in the same Manner, with
Abacement of fome Circumftances, according to the Pleafure of the
General who was honoured with them. And tho' we find the Solem
nity regulated by Laws, precifely direlting in what Manner, at what
Time, and thro' what Gates and Streets the Cavalcade was to pats,
yet, as for the Plays, Shews, and other lets Appurtenances, they were
leffend or angmented at the Will of the Victor, with a Liberty to
chufe the Chariot. Hiffory rells us, that the Chariot was commonly
drawn by four white Horfes; but we alfo find Bulls ufed for the fame
Purpole. Pompey the Great, having fubdued Africa, made his Eary
on a Chariot drawn by Elephants. Sucrenins relates, that Tulius C4

for criumph’d in one with forty Elephants. The Emperor Cordianus
iumph’d in the fame Manner. Caras Marins, having subjected 42
frica and extended the Roman Jurifdiction into Egypt, was drawn by the
same Kind of Bealls. Scipice Africanus triumph’d with Elephams fer
the same Reafon. The Emperor Auguffus, on his victorious Return
from the Eaff and ending the War with Anthony, was, by Confent of
the Senate and People of Rome, drawn by four Elephants. The Em-
peror Vespassan had the fame Honour on finithing feveral great Wars in
the Eot; the Elephants denoting the Conquelt of Countries, where
those Creatures breed. Flavins, in his Hiftories, tells us, that the
Emperor Harelian, who was King of the Gotbs, made his Entrance on
a Chariot drawn by Stags. But Marcus Antoniss made ufe of tame
Lions; intimating, that, in the Civil Wars, he would make the moft
Valiant fubmit to his Commands: Which Cicero in his Orations,
called Philippica, objects him, faying, that his triumphal Cha-
riot with Lions implied, an arbtrary Man aiming at Monarr
CA
The Roman Generals, when they triumph’d, had alfo a Cultom of
carrying one or more young Children in their Chariots; as we garber
from Cicero's Speech before Mureng. Some uted to be attended with
2 great Number of flrange wild Beafts, as Lions, Bears, Tygers, Rhi-
noceroles, Panthers, Dromedaries, and tuch like; as Josephas, in his
Hifories of the Vespasians, mentions. Others had Vocal and infiru-
mental Mufic and other Diverlions. Among thefe Triumphs, thole
of Pempey the Great, Cafar, the two Scipic's, Brothers, and feveral
Emperors had fomething lingular; as Blondas, in his Treatife, entituld,
Rome Triumpbant, largely difcourfes. The triumphins Conquerors
were likewile allowed to fet up their Starues in Temples and
publick Places, and to erelt Columns and coftly Structures of Mar-
ble, called Areus Triumphales, whereon were carved in Balsrelief
their Bartles and Viftories, for eternal Monuments to Polterity
Remains whereof we fee to this Day at Rome and elfewhere. Herein
the Romans imitated the ancient Greefs, who, for a Memorial of great
Altions, fet up Trephies, made in the following Manner. in the Place
of Victory, they fixed the highelt Tree to be found in the Neighbour-
hood, and then, chopping off the Branches, they, in Honour to the
Viltor, hung, on the remaining Limbs, the Arms of the Vanquith’d;
calling that Tree, Trephaum, from the Greet Word Tropi, which fig.
nifies, Overthrow, Flight and giving way; becaute the Enemies were,
in that Place, put to Flight. The Romans afterwards made ufe of

chat Porgey, having conquer’d the Ipaniards, planted his Trophies on
the Tops of the higheft Pjresces. And this Cullom afterwards grew
into fuch Effcem, that they were made of Stone. But, according to
Scripture, the Ulage was very ancient among other Narions; for it
appears in Chap. 1s. of 1 Sam that Saul, having vanquih’d Ayag, King
of the Imalckires, and, being come to Mount Carmel, fer up an Arcus
Tikmpbslis, or Place. in a Word, the Honour of Triumphing was
accounted by the Romans as a Token of the higheft Efteem; and there.
fore, to obtain, it, their Generals (pared for no Toils or Dangers in
Warlike Archievements: Add to this, the Riches commonly arnting
from fixh Glory by the Prefents made them by the Allies and the
Boory of the Enemy. In my Opinion, Hifforians have defcribed this
Matter to circumftancially, on purpote to put Princes and Governours
in mind of rewarding the Deferts of their Generals, Soldiers and
Rien of Merit, and thar the Unskilful, Cowardly and unfit for Com
mand might not be ranged with thote who willingly facrificed their
Fortunss, Capacities and Bodily Labours to the Bencht of their Coun

Phane; or the lllatrious, King of Syris, having heard of the aforelaid
glorions Triumph of Pualus Earlias, was to puff’d with Ambition,
that he refolved to make a Sort of one furpaffing it in Magnificen:e.
To which end, he cauted Proclamation to be made throughout his
Kingdom, that, at a certain Time, he would at Duptnes hold a grand
22d Lacommon Tournament: Which Curioficy drew our of Greece and

Lhe neighbourng Countries a great Concourfe of People; and the
Caralcaue was in the following Mlanner.

3c5o TFraians and gess Gulltians, follow’d by a vall Number of
other Nations, called, for their Silver Shields, A pyressides. After
theie came 250 Ranks of Sword-plavers, called, by the Romins, 6s
distores; and then 1500 Knights, with Chaplets of Gold abour their
Heads, and their Hories cortly equipt with old embroider’d Houlings
and gold and filver Bridles. Thefe were followed by 1ooo other
Knights, called Companions, affociated with fome of the King's Frieed
and Conidents. Then appeared 1000 Noblemen on Foot, and ate

them 1000 other Knights, called the King's Troops. Next came
1500 Knights in gold Armour, over which they had Coats of Ar-
mourrichiy embroider’d with Gold and Silver, and artfully adorned with
allforts of Animals. To thefe fucceeded 100 Chariots, each drawn by
fix Horfes, follow’d by
40 others, each with 4. After thefe appear’d a
Chariot with Elephants, followed by 36 of the fame Kind of Creatures,
and thofe by Soo Boys, having Garlands and Crowns ornamented with
Gold in their Hands. Next came 1o0o fat Oxen with 800 Indian
Elephants Teeth. After thefe were carried an infinite Number of Idols
and Figures of deceafed Perfons who had been famousfor Artsand Sciences,
dreft in gold and filver Stuffs adorned with precious Stones, with their
Names, Dignities and Actions written on the Pedeftals. Then came
Slaves bearing Idols, reprefenting Night and Morning, Midday and
Evening, and an intinice Number of gold and filver Veffels of great Value.
Next appear’d 600 of the King's Pages dreft in gold Stufts, follow’d
by 200 Ladies carrying gold Boxes fill’d with all manner of rich Per-
fumes and odoriferous Balm, and thefe by 4o Sedans of maffy Silver
carrying as many Ladies, and thofe by 8o gold Sedans with Ladies
dreft in Gold, Silver and Jewels. The Streets abounded with all forts of
rich Oils, Balms and Perfumes. This Cavalcade latted thirty Days
fucceffively, attended with Plays, Tourniments and Shews; during
which Time, every Perion, after perfuming himself, was allowed to
fit at the Royal Tables, rgoo in Number, and to feaft at the King's
Expence. To proceed to the Romans.
Another Solemnity obtain’d among them, call’d Oratio; which was
inferior to the Triumph in fome of its Requifires: For inftance, if
the Viltor was not of Confular or Proconfular Dignity, or had met
with little Refiffance from the Enemy, or gain’d the Victory without
great Blood-thed, or had overcome People of small Worth, or (as we
said, speaking of the Corona Ovalis) when the War was undertaken
without the express Command of the Senate, Cc. in fuch Cafes, the
Viltors were folemaly welcom’d with the Overio, in the following
Manner.
The General enter’d the City on horfe-back, or, as anciently, on
foot, crown’d with Myrle, (a Tree facred to Fenus) becaute the Vic-
tory was gain’d not in a Martial, but in a Manner becoming that
Goddess and Women, as Aulus Gellins fays; and the Troops in their
Proceffion appear’d not in Arms, and, inflead of Drums, Trumpets and
other Warlike Inftruments, their Mulic was Flutes and other fofe
Sounds. The General entered with the Booty in an orderly Manner,

follow’d by his Army, and the Senace folesinly received him without
the City-gares, highly commending his Altions. Hiffories tell us, that
feveral great Generals fued for and accepted this Honour. The firff
was Paftamiss Libertus, on his having fubdued the Sabises, and next
Marcus Marcellss after the Conquett of Syracuse. Suctonins relates,
that Augytiss, after the Barcle of Pbilippi, and on finithing the Warin
Sicify, obtained that Honour. And Pliny fays, that feveral Generals,
denied by the Senate, the Honour of the great Triumph, were decreed
the Oratre; which was to called, from the General's offering a Sheep,
in Laun Ovis, when he came to the Capitol, inflead of a Bull, facrit
ced in the Great Trrumph. Others think the Word is derived from
the Shours of the People, who ufed to cry, OcI or elfe Ove! Whatever
the Truch is, this folemn Entrance was always call’d, by the Remans,
Oratio.
Other Tnumphs of thofe People 1 shall, for Brevity, omit (peaking
of. He who wants further information, may read Appianus Atexan-
drinus and Ammianus Marcellinus, the former defcribing the Triumph
of Scipie Africanns, and the latter that of the Emperor Consfar

C H A P. VI. Of the Manner of the four principal and publick
GGrecian Games, and to whose Henour infituted.
HE Anriquity and Manners of the Grecian-Games being some
what unknown to many curious Arcifts, I think it will be ac
ceptable to give a fhort Description (as well as I can) of the four prin
cipal Games to highly and to ofcen excolled by the Greek and Roman
Writers
The firfl and principal were called the Olympic Games, held near
the City Olynfia, in the Province of Elis, and inftituted in Honour of
Tupiter Olmpins, by the Idaan Hercules and his four Brothers, Paoncus,
Idas, Tafus and Epimedes, meeting together from Mount lda in Cun
dis, and, being five Brethren, they were fliled the Idaan Dactyl.
Thefe Cames being celebrated every five Vears with great Solemnty,
the Ancients therefore reckon’d their Time by Otympiads, thereby
underftanding a Period of five Vears. They confitted of five forts of
Exercifes, viz. Running, Wrefiling, Boxing, Throwing the Coit and
Leapins


Of Stilllife.
589.
Chap. 6.
Leaping. The Place of Exercife was fenced in with Pales,: and po.
Speltacor was fuffer’d to come within it.
Some pretend, thefe Games were infliruced by Tapiter, after he had
deflroyed the Giants who attempted to fform Heaven; and that Apello
oot the Preference in our running Mercury; that Mars bore away the
Prize in Wrelling, Boxing, Coc. Others prove, that each of the
aforefaid Brethren invented his Game and Exercife, and that, being five
in Number, they were, from the five Fingers, named Dactyls, Duity.
1os, in Greek, fignifying a Finger.
The Greeks called thefe five Exercifes Pentatblen; and the Latins,
Quinquertium. Two of them had a Dependance on the Legs, viz.
Running and Leaping; two on the Arms, as the Coils and Boxing, and
the Wreltling respected both Arms and Legs. The Victor, in all the
five Exercifes, was, by the Greeks, called Pancratiaffes; a Word com-
pounded of Pan and Krates, fignifying, a bellowing the whole Force
of the Body. In Boxing, all Advantages might be taken for overcom=
ing the Antagonift; and the Prize was adjudged to him who gained his
Point moft dextrouly. Accordingly, they truck with Fifts and El.
bows, Kick’d, bit, ferarch’d and (prain’d the Kingers, Hands and other.
Parts of the Body. They even endeavour’d to thrull out each others
Eyes with their Thumbs.. in Chort,, no Artifice was omitted for gain:.
ing the Victory.
We shall briefly relate in what Manner the aforelaid five Exercifes
ere performed.
The Circus, wherein they ran on foot, was originally a Stadium,.
or 600 Geometrical Feet in Length: But, in the 14th Olympiad, they
doubled it. This Race was at firff on foot, and in a light Dref
but afterwards on horle-back, and in Armour. Men, called Runners.
this Exercife
on foot, were alfo admitted armed from Top to Toe;
being judged very proper for the Bodies of Warriors. The firft Vic-
for herein was Demaratus of Hereg: And the Hymas fing in their
Honour, fufficiently teflify their running in Armour. But the firtt,,
who got the Prize in running without Armour, was Chorabus, of Elis.
after a long Contell with him about it.. Arrachion, of Phigalia. ob-
tained the Prize in the second and third Exercifes; and Potyerates, of
Moffene, a Man of noble Extraction, got much Honour and Glory in
11
e fourth;, wherein he was Viltor.
The Wreting was undertaken after the Body had been thoroughly
anointed with Ayl, in order to prevent a Cripe, and then daubed with.
fine Duft, to dry the Sweat.. Thus prepared, the Wreftlers entered.
the Lifts, and began with feizing the Hands, then the rms and Body
under.

under the thort Ribs, Cor. Thus endeavouring, by various Mechods of
Strength and Dexterity, in Kicking, puthing, and other Tricks, to
Hing one another on their Backs; for a Fall on the Belly weat for
nothing. Before they encerd the King they cauted their Parts to be
foundly rubb’d, to make them more fupple and agile.
Boxing, and fighting with Slings were the moft dangerous Exercifes
The former was ancrently performed with Ox-leather Thongs tied
about the Hands, by which, with wonderful Activity, they dealt each
other very hard Blows. But the Slings confifted of small Lea.
therttraps, armed ar the Ends with little leaden Balls, the Blow
whereof, when it happen’d on the Head, lay’d the Adverlary
dead.
The Coit was a flat, round, heavy Piece of Stone or Lead, to try
the Force of Arms and Hands, and to fee who could fling higheft and
furtheit: An Exercife Htill in Ufe, in many Places, to this Day; but
with this Difference, that the Ancients, with a Leg lifted up, threw
the Coir ar a Mark, fet up on a small Pyramid, and refembling s
Pine-apple.
The titth Exercife was lets perilous, as confifting only of divers
Miahnners of Leaping.
The ancient Garlands or Crowns, given as a Prize to the Viltoron
theic Occaions, were made of Olive-leaves; but they varied according
to the Times; for they were afterwards compoted of Couch -grats,
Willow, Laurel, Myrle, Oak, Palm and wild Parlley-leaves; as
Piatarch, in the Lifs of Cuts Uricents, relates. But when made of
Olive-leaves, they chole a felect Kind, called Calliffepbanes, i. c. be.
fifst Crown, having hanging Branches, like the Myrcle, very proper
for twiling Garlands. The Leaves of fuch Garland differed much
from others, in that, being white withour, the Green, when twilled,
was inward; whereas the others were white within, and appeared greed
withour. Herexies and his Brethren firft brought this Plant into
Greece from the Northern Countries, as Punfunias, in his Olsmpus, tells
us.
The Pyttian Gumes were inftituted long before the Uphmian, yet aftee
the Obmbic, and celebrated in Honour of Apollo, for his Victory orer
the frightful Serpent Pyrton. Some think they were to called,
from Pyrbss, the Place of Celebration, or elfe from the Greek Word
Pyrbelar, to confult; becaute they confulted there the Oracle, in order
to know the Events of Things to come. The Exercifes in thefe Games
only differed from the Ohmpic in this, that the Pythian were per

tarmed under the Sound of all Sorts of Vocal and Inftrumental Malx.
Thote Games, from time to time, had feveral Alteraciens in Form.
and Solemnity, after the inlicution of the Pancretium or Quinquertium:
And it is related, that in the firtt & Pyrhiades, wherein the moft illuf
vious Hferoes and Gods of the Ancients enter’d the Lifts, for the Sake
of the Prize; Gaffer prevail’d in the Horferace; Pollux in Boxing;
Calais in Running on foot; Zetbes in Running in complete Armour;
Peleas in Throwing the Coit; Telamen in Wreftling; and Hercules
in the Pancratium, or, all the Games.
in each of thefe Games and Exercifes, the Victors were crowned
with Laurel, which in particular was confecrared to them; becaute the
Ancients believed, by what they have feigned of Penens's Daughter,
with whom spotfo was to much enamour’d, and who was metamor-
phiz’d into that Tree, that the God took a fingular Delight in it.
But others will have the inflitution of the Pythian Games to be long
before Apollo's Amour with the beautiful Daphne: And before the
Laurel bore that Dillinction, both the Triumphal and Victors Crowns
and Garlands were made of Paim or Oak-leaves; as Orid, in his Firft
Book of Mctamerphesss, teftifies. Plutarch and Punsanmas relate, that
Thefeus, on his Return from Creta, adorned the Victors, in the Games
inflituted in Honour of Apollo, with Garlands of Palm, as Tokens of
Praife and Renown; for the Laurel was not known ill after the Pyrhian
Games were fertled, and when known, it gave the Rife to the aforefaid.
Fable of Dupbne; and both the Tree and Leaves being found of to ex
traordinary a Make and Nature, illurious Victors and Men of Learning
were commonly crowned with it. Some again fay, that Apolle affected
the Leaves and Bloffoms of the Apple-tree, before he chofe the Law-
rel, and therefore the Viltors in Running, Wreilling, Cc. ought to be
crowned with that; as the Poet Archias, in his Aythelog. lib. s. cap.
4 relates. But Lucimas afferts, that tho', in the Pythiun Games, the
Garlands of Laurel began to prevail, yet they were intermixt with
fine yellow Apples: Some Writers even affirm, that the Laurel of
Delphos bore fuch large Berries or Fruit, as almoff to gain the Name
of Apples. But the true Reafon of this Difference proceeded from the
fererar Alteracions made both in the Prizes and Times of holding
thofe Games; for originally they were celebrated every. mingb Vear
from the Number of Nymphsfeigned, by the Ancients, to come from.

The Nemees Games were kept in a Wood of that Name, firuate be
tween Pblisas and Cleona, two Cities of Acbaia, in Honour and Me
mory of frebemoras, otherwife call’d Opbeltes, Son of Lycurgus, on
account of his being kill’d by a Serpent in this Wood. Which Ac-
cident fome relare thus: Oedigns, having, thro' Miltake, married his
own Mother, the Widow of Lains King of Tbebes, begat on her two
Sons, Freocles and Polnices, to whom he refigned the Royal Dignity,
on condition they govern’d by turns: But Ereocles, as the Eldell, having
obrain’d the firff Vears Adminitration, refus’'d to admit his Brother as
a Parrner to govern the fecond Vear, who thereupon, in Difcontent,
follicuing the Aid of Adrafius, King of Arges, whofe Daughter, call’d
Argis, he married, the King, in Conjunction with his other Son-
in law, Tydeas, raifed a great Army, in order to wage War with the
Thebans, and bring them to Reaton. The Iffue of this War was,
the Death of the two Brothers in a Duel; and their Bodies, according to
Cutom, beinglaid on a large Pile of Wood to be burnt, the Flames hap.
pen’d to divide and feparate, as if they bore Witness of the immorial
Hatred of the two Brethren in their Life times, which ceafed not with
their Deaths Now in the rmy, which Adraffus fent to Polynices's
Affirtance, were feven Commanders, who, being arrived in the Iland
Lemnes, pertaining to T bracis, and feized with an extream Thirfl, met
Hipppjle, carrying, in her Arms, the Child Oppettes, Son of Lycurgus
(Prieft of Tuoner) and Kuridice, whom, being a Native of that Coun
try, they increated to thew them where to get fome Water. Where
upon the, in hatle, yer fearful of laying the Child on the Ground, as
forbidden by the Oracle, before he could walk, fet him naked on the
Grats by a large Plant of wild Parlley, near a Fountain, where a Ser
pent, lying perdue, fuddenly wound itfelf about the Childs Neck,
and throtuled him, while the was gone to draw Water. The Com
manders, being apprifed of this unhappy ccident, Kill’d the Serpent,
and, to folace the Father, inflituted, in Honour of his Son to fuddenly
loll, the aforefaid Games, to be held every chird Vear: Wherefore
originally only Soldiers and their Defcendants were admitted to them,
tho', in procets of Time, they were free for every Perfon. Theagenes,
in his Memoirs of Egina, Book 4 Chap. 1z. relates, that Hipppile
fied from Lemnes to Nemal, on account of a Combination among the
Women, to Kill all the Men, only our of Jealouty, becaute, by the
Inligation of Venus, highly incens’d againft them, they had had to do
with other Women. Accordingly they all put their Defign in Praltice,
excep: Hipppyfe, who endeavoured to fave her Father's Life, by hid

ing him in a Bakers Trough. (This happen’d foon after the Departure
of the Argenents, and their rrival in this Ifland.) But being difco-
vered, they flung him, with the Trough, into the Sea, and condemned
Hipppyle to die, for not agreeing to their general Refolution. She,
hearing this, made her Elcape, but, in her Flight, was taken by Pi-
8
rates, and fold for a Slave to Lycurgus, whofe Wife, Euridice, defirire
the might be put to Death, for the Misforcune of her Child, the hid
herfelf in a remote and folitary Place; where being difcovered, by the
Southlayer Amphiaraus, to the two Sons of Euridice, Theas and Kunoe-
ts, who made diligent Search after her, the was, thro' their intercef-
fion, and the Commanders Tellimony of her Innocence, pardon’d, and
readmitted into Favour. Others will have it, that Hercales inflituted
thefe Games, on having killed, in the Wood Nemaa, a terrible Lyon
who devoured all before him, and lay’d the Country walle. Some lay,
they were fet up in Honour and Memory of Archemoras; but that Her-
cales, after having flain the emaan Lyon, with whofe Skin he cover’d
his Head and Body, brought them under a Regulation, and dedicated
them to Tapiter; appointing their Solemnization to be every three
Vears, on the 12th Day of the Month, called, by the Corinthians, Pa-
Mmes, and, by the Athenians, Boedromies, antwering our Month of
Angut: And the rather, as Tbefeus had, in that Month, happily van-
quittd the Amazons. Bur others are of Opinion, that it was done in
Memory of Opbettes, who, by his own Death, prefaged the Fare of
the Lacedemomans, at War with the Thebans. Vet some think, that
this was another Opbelfes, Son of Expbetas and Creufa, who, being laid
on the Ground by his Nurfe, while the went to thew some Commanders
2 Fountain, was killed by a Serpent.
The Nemaan Games were therefore inflituted in Memory and Confo-
lation of Lycurgus, Enridice and Opbeltes, and the Judges, who deter-
mined the Prizes, were dreft in black and mourning Garments. For
Oppettes was afterwards called Archemorus, becaute Amphiarans had,
at his Birth, prefaged him an early and untimely Death; Archo figni-
lying, in Greek, Beginning, and Moros, Death; as if they faid
Ding Bortly after his Birth: in which Sente (peaks the Poct,

That is, We begin dyingfrom our Births, and our Beginnings and Ends

The Exercifes in thefe Games were the same as in the others: But

Schnrn, with us, common Parfley, and the Petroselinon, or Stone parsley,
be the tame, let Botanifts decermine. Originally, the Victors in thefe
Cdime were crowned with Garlands of Olives; but after the Defeat of
the Las they began to be prefented with one of wild Parfley, in
ifemery of thots who were flam in that bloody Bartle: And after this
Regilarion, the faid Herb, inflead of crowning the Head on Occations
of prful Meetings, ferv’d only in Times of Sorrow and Mourning.
For, according to the Greek Saying, this Herb is very earchj, as
ipreiding a long Time over the Ground, and often bearing to be dug
ip, in order to get deeper Roor. The feed of it alfo, on lowing, is

lo.g., than others in coming up; wherefore it was as neceffary, thit
the morral Greet Ofeckres, atterwards (as we have faid, called hois.
MTHis would be crowned with earthly Honour. For of the four prin¬
cipil Games, which we handle in this Chapter, two, according to
the Poet 4,c0:1s, are lacred to Mortals, and the others to Denies:
The Moreals are frccenor is and Arclicerts, who is alfo called Fule-
5 7; and the Gods are Tugiter and Apolte. The wild Parlley is not
without Reaion appropriated to thefe Games; becaute some think it
foang from the Blood of the Child, killed by the serpent: fet this
contradicts thoie who far, that Hipppite laid the Child on this Plant;
which therefore was already known at that Time. We shall now pro-
cxel to the 1r iai Gumrs.
This Solemnity was performed at Night, in the Lihmus of Cerizs,
Parting Ltris from the Contnent of Greece; and had rather the face
of 2 Stertnce and iis Mifteries, than of a Feltiral. It was intlitured

herfelf, with the other Child Melicerts, to the Mountains Geranes, fi-
tuated between Megara and Corintb. But the, finally, alfo yielding to
Rage, caff herfelf, with the Child, from the Rock Moluris, into the
Sea; where the was metamorpholed into a Sea-nymph, and called
Lencothea, and he into a Sea-god, under the Name of Palamon. The
dead Body of Melicerts being afterwards brought on Shore by a Dol-
phin, Sippbus, King of Corinmb, who was his Uncle, commanded
him to be buried in the Wphoms, and a Circus to be there erected, for
the Celebration of the aforefaid Games.
But the Poet Archias fays, that on lnos flinging herfelf, with Mich-
cits, into the Sea, a Dolphin landed their Bodies on the Schamentian
Shore, where Amphimachus and Denacinus took them up and brought
them to Sippphus, King of Corinth; and then they were deified, the
by the Name of Lencothed, which in Greek fignifies, the white Goddess,
and he by that of Palamon.
Lencothea, called, by the Latins, Mruta, is Day-break; and Pa-
lamen, or Portunus, the Vebemence of Storms and Billows: For pallein,
in Greck, lignities, to tess, move, and puss violently against each other;
whence comes the Name of Palamon: He was the Son of Matata,
of Morning, becaufe the Winds commonly begin to arife with Day-
break.
Others tell us, that Melicerta's dead Body being call on the Shore of
the Wphmas, and lying unburied, it cauted a great Plague; and
that, on confulting the Oracle; touching the Crufe of the Infec-
tion, antwer was made, that Afehcerts ought to have a magnificent
Funeral, and folemn Races and Games should be appointed in his Ho-
Bour and Memory. The Corinthians obeyed, and the Body was ac-
cordingly taken up by Amphimachus and Donacinus, and in an honour-
able Manner bursed in the Place aforelaid; and the Games and Fu-
heral Rices being inflitured, the Plague ceafed: But afterwards it broke
out afreth on their Omiffion of the Solemnity; wherefore, in this their
Mimoll Difiress, the People, re confulting the Oracle, were told, they
mull for ever celebrate the Games they had begun in Mlemory of Mc-
lierts, and diftribute the Rewards to the Victors. But Alusans, de-
Cribing thefe Cames, fays, that the Cultom was to perform, every
his Years, two Sorts of Games and Races in the Ipamus; one in
Honour of Niptane, near his Temple; and the other in Memory of
Pelicerta.
The Prize in the Libmian Games was originally a Crown of Parfley,
elegantly wreathed; but afterwards, a Garland of Pine-leaves, on

mories
We shall, to conclude this Chapter, fubjoin a thort Description
of some particular Garlands or Crowns, lacred to the Heatheniss
Deities.
The Phenicians, as Eufebius ceftifies, honour’d and worhipp’d the
Herbs and Plints. The Greeks, in imitation of them, render’d almof
the fame Duries, not only to Trees, but alfo to Herbs and Flowers.
Thefe maintain’d, that the Charites, or three Graces, were the very
tird Crowners of Punfors. Pherecydes fays, that Saturn was crowned
before any others. Ver, according to Drodorus, Tupiter claims this
Honour, for his Conquelt over the Giants. But, not to pretermit the
Egigtian Monuments, Ifs firft crowned herfelf with green Sprigs and
Eirs of Corn; of which, according to the Egyptian Writer, Leen, the
was the Inventor.
The Ost and its Fruit, as Apolledorus writes, were facred to the
Goddels Rbes, otherwife called, the Earth; that Martals, who pro-

The ancient Romans, on their None Caprotina, or Feftivals Kept
monthly, in Honour of Tane, crowned that Goddess with Fig-leaves,
as a Memorial of the City of Rome (reduced to the urmoff Extremity
by the Gaals, who demanded of the Senate feveral noble Virgins as
Hollages) regaining its Freedom by the Contrivance of the Virgin Pbi-
lotis, who thewing the Romans how to flide down from the Walls,
by the Branches of a Fig-tree growing thereon, and facred to June,
gave them an Opportunity of falling on the Enemy when drunk and
alleep (which the had cunningly inticed them to) and, by a great
Slaughter, to obtain a compleat Victory over them. The Pemegra-
nate was conlecrated to June by the People of Mycenc. The white
Lilly is alfo facred to her; and therefore called Fles Tunonius, or, ac

that Tree furpaffes all others in tender and beautiful Leaves, and their
continual Greennets and Smell; which recommends it to tenus, the
moft beautiful, moft tender and moft perfect of the Goddeffes. In old
Times, Men, on Fellival-days, ufed to put into each others Hands;
Branches of this Tree, as Tokens of Joy, and that they should join
in Cherus. And Herace fays, that, in Lent-time, cben the Earth, by
her Variety of Flowers, seems to rejoice, we ought to adorn our Heads

Thinking it prefumptuous, to enumerate all the Particulars of the
Afilitary Order of the Ancients, as having been largely handled by
feveral Authors; we shall therefore, accordng to our imall Ability and
for the Service of curious Artifts, only touch briefly on fome of the
principal Matters relaring to their Arms, believing the Relidue
will follow in the Courfe of their Praltice. I shall begin with the
Giecks.

armd, and Arcbers or Light arm’d. The Pikeman uted a Buckler, a
fort of Boots, a Pike 20 or 24 Feet in Length, and a Sword. The
Stowreff had, for Defence, a Afacedonian round Shield of four Feet
Diameter. The Archer; bore Bucklers of Wicker, Bows, thort Pikes
and Slings. They wore long Hair and Beards, and Helmets or Head
pieces fomewhat projecting over the Face, handfomely wrought with
imagery or Foliage, fet off with Plumes and other elegant Ornaments
Their Military Dreffes always excelld in Variety and Elegance
Their Coats of Armour reached down to the Knees, cut out, on the

Shoulders and below, into Straps which were often adorned with Lions-
heads. Some intlead of Strags, had wifted Fringes. The Generals and No-
bility wore Buskins of young Lions or Tygersskins; or elfe, neat Sandals:
But the inferior Sort had plain Sandals with Strings. Their Swords
hung by their left side by a fmall Hook on the Girdle, and on their
right side was a Dagger.
in the Roman Military Order the young Men, between 17 and 25
Years of Age, were appointed for Velites, or fuift Footmen or Light-
arm’d; the Haftati, for Darters or Pikemen; tuch as were in their
Prime, for Principes; and the Aged, for Triaris.
The Velites wore a lmall Buckler of a Foot and a half long, an
Head piece, a Sword and a Lance three Feet long and a Thumb
thick, arm’d with a sharp triangular pointed Steel or Head of a Foot
in Length. Some carried Slings; others, Bows.
The Haffati and Principes wore a Chort Coat of Armour, that they
might be the firter for March and the Management of all Sorts of
Arms; they had long Breeches reaching half-way the Legs and clofe at
the Knees, an Helmer, and a large Oval Buckler two Feet and an half in
the Tranfverfe, and four or five Feet in the conjugate Diameter: They
were girt with Swordson both Sides; that on the Left much longer than
the other, which, like a Dagger, was but a Span long. Their other
Weapons were, two Darts or wooden Staves; one thin, like an Arrow,
and three Cubits long, and headed with Iron; and the other of the
tame Length, and as thick as the Breadth of the Hand, with a fonted
Iron Head as long as the Staff, and let halfway into the Wood, and
belet with Hooks: This lron, next the Wood, was a Finger and a
half in Thicknets.
The Triaris bore the fame Arms as the Principes, except that in-
Read of the Darts they ufed Pikes, formerly carried by the Hafati
and from whence they took their Name) who left them for the Darts.
The richeff armed themfelves with commodious Body-coats inflead of
Brealt-pieces. The Romans generally wore thort Hair, with thaved
Chins, but the Hair growing on each side of their Checks. Vet we
mull obferve, that Scipie was the only Perfon amons them who had
long Hair. The Reman Helmets cloting with the Forchead, were
made either of double Leather, lron or Brass, and crefted on Top, like
the Greeks, but less fumptuous; except thofe of the Generals and other
Commanders, which were plum’d. Some alfo had wing'd Helmets,
and, on the Crefl, a Smake of Dragon or an Eagte's Head. We find
likewife, that the ancient Romans, in their Marches; carried a Saw, a.

Days. The Herculanm, of the old Troopen and the Toviniani, or,
according to Vegetins, Toviunm, were two felelt Roman Legions, con-
titling of 6o00 Men each, and ferving in Sclavenis, to whom the
Emperor Diocketianas (who cauted himfelf to be stiled, Tupiter and
Mhrriminianas Hercules) after they had gaind him the imperial Dig.
ir, gave that Name, in Preference to all other Legions, for their
Valour. Thefe, befides their large Swords and oblong Shields, had
Darts, the infides whereof were run with Lead, and called Manerbur-
Ers, which, for their Heavinets forwards, they could caft with fuch
Force and Certainty, that, before they ufed Arrows and Swords, they
to gall’d the Enemy and their Horfes, as to gain the Emperors feveral
great Bartles.
The Roman Horfe wore an Helmet and Brealt-piece like the Foot,
had a Crots fhield by the Horfes Side, a long Sword on their right
side, a Javelin in their Hands, and in their Quivers three or more Ar-
rows, broadiron’d yet tharp-pointed, and not inferior to the Javelins.
The Ensigns, both of Foot and Horfe, wore Lyons Skins over their
military Dreffes; and the Trumpets the fame, fave that the two Fore-
paws of the Skins were, by thefe latter, tied under their Chins, ferring
them allo for Cloaks. Thefe Skins were not meerly flead with the
Hair on, but alto firred for Service, and underneath either fringed or
elegantly cur our.
The anidiens and Cretians, under Roman Command and aiding them
on Horfeback, as Need requird, were arm’d with Bows and Arrons,
and alio with Slings, wherewith they dexteroutly fiung Stones. Pirj

Ths Ligrions, who for a long Time valiantly kept the Romins ai
Bay, were well-dikiplin’d Soldiers; arm’d with a Breatt-piece, an Hel
me:, a Shield and in a clofe Dreis. They were allo very expert in

rowing the Javelin.
The 3ptera, a barbarous Peopie and Horfemen, wore crefted Hel
Fcs forsed on Top; ther carried Bows, Duggers and Battle-axes.

Bow and caff the Dart, cover’d like the refl of their Bodies. Their
Garment, button’d below, reached not quite to their Knees. Their
Defence was a Target or large round Shield, cut hollow, at one of the
Extremities, into the Form of two conjoin’d Crefcents, having a Part
in the Middle for covering and guarding the Arm and Hand One of
thefe Cuts ferved for managing the Lance and the other to look thro.
They likewife carried Axes and Hammers.
The Goths, together with the great Attily, defcended from the Scy-
thians, were arm’d with Bows, Arrows, long and firong Spears or
Lances, Shields and Helmets. The Horfemen, fullarmourd and car
rying Rrong Lances, Hammers and Clubs, would leap on their Horles
without the Help of the Stirrupor other Advantage; especially on lmooth
lee, or in fnowy Ground, where they generally fought their greatell Bar-
tles. Sometimes, as Need requir’d, and in the Heat of Bactle, they would,
in full Gallop, throw themfelves on another Horfe, turning and winding,
with incredible Swifiness, even, carching up a Lance from the Ground,
Co. An Evidence what great Warriors thefe People formerly were.
The Persians and Spartans were very much alike in Drels, except
in their Head ornaments. The former wore Turbants, and the latter,
Caps, like a Night cap, yet pointed on Top and curling forwards; or
clle, lron Head-pieces, like the Remans, but plain and without a Cred.
They had long Hair and their Beards almofl hid their Ears. On the
other Hand, the Persions shav’d both Head and Face. Their Veft-
ment, girt about the Middle, reach’d below the Knees: They wore
allo long open Breeches and wide Stockings and Shoes. They uled fcaled
Arms, round Shields, Greaves or Shinarmour, Scimitars, Daggers, shore
Spears but long Bows: The Scimitars hung on the right Thigh, cross
the Body, and the Dagger on the fame Side, but at the Girdle. Ar
their Back, was the Quirer.
Darins, the laft King of Perfia, was commonly array’d in a rich
Purple Mantle intermixt with white Strips, fatten’d on each Shoulder
with precious Stones, and before, with a gold Chain or Hook. His
Cost of Armour, wrought with Gold, was embroider’d on the Breaft
with three golden Eagles, having pread tings and Tails and Billscurning

The Ducians wore Gowns hanging down to the Heels and open on
the Sides, and over them a Coat of Mail which reach’d to the Middle.
Their Helmets fat clofe about the Head and ran up to a Point. Their
Arms were Bows and Arrows, Daggers and Javelins; and their Horfes
wholly guarded, except the Eyes, with fcaled Coverings.
The Partbians, Medes and Afjrians were guarded like the Perssuns;
fave, that the Purthiuns wore large Coats of Mail covering both Man
and Horie, and the Affrians, brats Hlead-pieces.
The Prrigians and Armenians uled Helmers, thort Spears, Javelins
and Daggers, wearing wide Stockings and Shoes like the Persians.
The Curthaginians were as elegant and magnificent in Arms as the
Perfians.
The Mscedsnians and their Neighbours differed little in their Dress
and Arms from the Greeks; And
The Romuns and Trojuns the fame.
The Lecedemonians firft began to carry a Shield, Sword and Ax.
The People of Caris were the firft who ferv’d for Pay, carried
Shields, bore Armour and had Plumes or Feathers on their Helmers.
The Thracians wore Head pieces of Fox-skins, Coats of Armour,
party-colour’d Dreffes and Stockings of Skins. Their Weapons were
Darts, round Shields and Daggers.
The Erhicgranfforfe were guarded with an Helmet, Cost of Armour
reaching half-war the Thighs, powder’d with fron Eyes, and proof
againit Cuts and Puthes. Their Arms were, a round Shield, a Lance,
2 Scimitar and Clubs plared with lron. Thofe who had no Helmees
wore long and hairy or woolly red Caps, like the Alamalukes in Egy
t.
The Foor, to hrike Terror into their Enemies, wore Skins of Lyons,
Frgers, Leepards and other wild Bealls; and had, for Weapons, large
Bows, Pikes, Arrows and Slings. The Emperor himfelf wore a coftly
gold and alver Diadem about his Head, and carried in his Hand a
filver Crucifix. He was dret in gold srutt, full pleated, over a filk Shit
with large Dical Sleeves, and from his Middle hung a loofe Garment
of Silk and gold Srull. His Body-guards, covering their Heads and

The Swifzers, from ancient Times good Soldiers,

Their Arms were ftrong Spears, Pikes and Clubs.
The Gouls carried large Shields and long Swords.
The People of the rerritory of Abruzze, anciently called Samnites,
were good Horfemen and Darters.
The inhabitants of Marchia Ancenitang, anciently Riled by the Ro-
mans, Ager Picenus, or Country of Woodpeckers, were likewife good
Soldiers, and bore a Shield, a Pike, an Helmet and Sword.
Thus I think to have made some Provifion for further Inquiry, that
Artills may not be at a Loss. He, who wants more Information, can
read Virgil, Ammianus Marcellinus, Vegetius, Polybins, and Herodotus
Halicarnafus; which laft, in the Life of Kerxes, lays down all the
Particulars relating to each People and all forts of Barbarians. Vitru-
vits allo has written a Treatife of the Roman Military Exercife.
Hemer, in his lhad, (peaking of Fights wherein some had gold, brats
and Reel Armour, fays — He pustd him in the Belly, but piered
not his Armour
And, in another Paltage — He dealt him
such a Blow on his Steel-breat as to make it firike Fire and refound.
Now, if it be ask’d, what fort of Armour this mult have been, of
malty Gold and other Metal? and whether it could be poffible for any
Perfon to move, bend and turn in fuch Armour as thew’d the Mukcles
and Limbs and fat clofe to the Body? Iantwer, they could not, and
that the Notion of their having been thus is wrong. I think thofe are
alfo out of the way who fuppole, they are to reprefented for the Sake of
Decorum, and that this is Reafon enough, without confidering
whether it be postible or not; fince other Reafons may be affign’d.
which can give better Satisfaction without forcing Nature. For
my Part, I believe, that the Arms and their Ufe were anciently as now,
and that the Coats of Armour were, like our Buff-coats, made of Lea-
ther. They may pothibly have been to contrived as to thew the Muf
ling; But granting it, they mutt be much firter for Ufe than if of Steel
or tolid Gold. Wherefore I cannot but think they were made of
Leather and of all forts of Colours, wrought or embroider’d with
Silver or Gold, even coverif over with Gold lke our gilt Learner.
and fet off with Scales, Foliage and other fuch Ornaments. I rerem.

I being, in Painting, abfolucely neceffary, firft, to diffinguith the Na-

gree, by Tokens either devited by themfelves, or appropriated by
others; I think proper to handle this Point largely, in order to thew
the Greamets of the Roman Power, and the many foreign Troops enter-
tain’d in their Service: 1 fay both Painters and Staruaries, especially the
latter ought to be acquainted with thefe Things, that, in reprefenting
either a particular Nation or Heroe, they may, on their Shichls, exhi
bit the proper Bidges of Diltinstion whereby to be preiently known by
Perfons converfant in Antiquiries. This Knowledge is as necelfary for

few People, from that Time reprefented it in the Entigns and Arms by
a Wiff of Hay; cauting this Token, as an happy one, to be born before
him in the enfueing Wars. The Romans afterwards painted, on their
Enligas and Standards, small red Flames, in Token of Success; as in the
Battle with the Sabines near Eretum, where the rms of the former
appeared by Night as if on Fire, without being damaged. Thus the
Standards and Entions of the Legions, by the Sight whereof the Sol
diers knew the Wills of their Generals, were from Time to Time aug-
mented. They had alfo, at different Times, divers other Tokens; as
openright Hands, the Image of their Emperors in Silver or Gold or gilt;
and fomerimes there hung under them a small Pendent, having the Genc-
fals or Peoples Motto, S. P. Q. R. They likewife bare in their Ban
nets, the Reprefentation of Welves, Minotaurs, eild Bours, Horfes,
Bulls and Dragons, till at laft they fixed on the Eagle for the chief Field-
Handard. The Romans uted the Wolf, Minotaur, wild Boar, Horfe,
Bull and Dragon, for the following Reafons; the Welf, partly, as he
was facred to Afars the God of War, and partly, becaute his Penetrati-
on is to great, that he can fee as well by Night as Day: Whereby they
meant, that a prudent General ought always to be on his Guard, to as
not to be fuprized by the Stratagems of the Enemy. By the Ainetour,

preas Wings, on a long Pike, as if he would fly ever the Univerle;
which Cuffom his Succeliors retained as a Royal Token. By a conflant
Confent of the Soothfayers, all Nations anciently afcribed to this Bird,
the Hozour of believing he prognofticated good Luck and happy Success

roung who was of mean Birth on his Mother's Side) making his firff
Campaign, an Eagle ffew down and fat on his Shield: Which was judg-
ed as a Pretage of his becoming, in Time, an excellent General and 2
King; as afterwards came to pass. The Pocts even fay, that this Bird
implies Profperity affigned to any Perfon by divine Providence. This
Opinion owes ir's Rile to the Relation of Angcreon, the firtt Writer of
Antiquities, that Tupiter, intending to deftroy the Giants who threatend
to Horm Heaven, the Powers of which he offered to, was, by the acciden
tal Flight of an Eagle, affured of an happy Success and Viltory; which
afterwards obtaining, he always bore a golden Eagle in his Arms and
Banners, as a perperual Memorial thereof. From Tupiter the Cretians
affurmed that Bird, and from them the Candiots. Kneas the Trajanin
troduced him among the Latins; and from them the Romans, in Pro-
cels of Time, came to ule him for their Arms: Tho' Lippar is of Opini
on, they affumed him after the Example of the Perssons. The Tuscans,
beaten by the Remans in their laft Conflict near the City of Eretum, on
the Borders of the Sabines, preiented Turquinias Priscus, King of the
Romans, their King's Regalis, to wit, a gold Crown, a purple Gar
ment, and Mande of various Colours, allo an Irory Chair, and an
Irory Scepter with an Eagle on Top, which he and his Succeffors always
bore. After the Banithment of the Kings, the Senate took the Eagh
from their Scepters, and fet him on their Pikes, exalcing him above
all their other rms, whether the Wolf, Minotaur, Horse, Wild Bear,
ec. Alyriss, when a Child, happening to find an Eagle's Neft with
7 Joung, a Prefage of his two Contulats, often placed the faid Number
in his Arms; and in his lecond Confulat, affigned the Eagte to the
Reman Legions, uling him only in Battles, in order to spirt the Sot
diers and atture them of Viltory. The other Military Tokens were
fet on the Tenrs; but larius took them down; and from that Time

Thefe Eagles were but fmall, and of Silver, and many had the Thun-
der in their Talons. The Romans firft ufed flver Eagles, as did allo
Bratus, becaute Silver is the brightelf Metal, and moft like the Day,
and therefore propereff for a Military Token: But afterwards, they
made ifieim of Gold, as more flately and furpafting the Silver. The
Romans firft ufed filver Tokens as being originally frugal and laving;

ury, Pomp and Shew.

Lucinnus writes, that the Pentagon is the Emblem of an happy
Enterprize and good Success, proceeding from the following Contide-
ration. Antiochus the Firft, firnam’d Soter, i. e. Saviour, waging War

TTEIA, or, I wish you Health and Prosperity, and to give it to his

it carried on their Arms, Shields and Banners, as being to ferve him
for a Token of Victory. Whereupon he defcrib’d to them the Shape
of this Emblem, which was, three Triangles drown -thro' each other
with five Lines, constituting a quintangular Figure, and on each Angle

The painted and engroy’d Shields (in reference to which, many of the
Leamed would derive the Lofis word Seatam, a Shield, from Sculpturs,
becaute it was cuftomary to engrave or reprefent glorious Actions and
Hiffories upon them) were anciently a certain Sign of the Valour of
thofe who carried them. And, left the Soldiers, in the heat of Bat-
tle, should mistake their Comrades, each Legion, according to Vege.
fins, had particular Marks on their Shields; and on the Infide of which
was Written each Soldiers Name, and what Company he belonged to.
The Shields or Targets were of different Makes at the Place where
they guarded the Hand: As, thofe of the firff Armenian Order had
two indentures cut out down the Sides; as we have faid in the foregoing
Chapter touching the Shields of the Amazons. Thefe Shields were of
2 Shy-blue Colour with a filver Field. Thofe of the second Armenian

The Afrians, TEggptians, Perfians and Greeks, for that Reaton
wted the same Token: Whence is probable the Turks, in Procets of
The

The Aibenians expreffed the ntiquity of their Delcent by a Gross-

and the Realon is plain. lis allo to be noted, that, of thofe Choices,
ose is as perfed as the other, with respect to Art, were it ever to
tingular; and tho' this Choice is but a small Part of the whole,
yet it is attended with as many Excellencies: For as a Bunch of Grapes
carries its perfection, to the leall Grain does the fame. But tho' both
the Parts, as well as the Whole, fall under the fame Rules, and one
Mafter underfland his Branch as well as the other; yet he, who has
from his Vouth applied himself to this or that fingle Choice, let his
Progrets therein be what it will, can perform nothing elfe thats good.
We have many inftances of excellent Mafters who departed from the
general to particular Choices with Applante, but of none who have
done the contrary without Difcredit. I reckon Difcredit as BadanEix-
change as Copper for Gold, or Water for Wine. Of the former Sort
are innumerable Ialian and French as well as Low Dutch Mafters;
but of the latter few, among whom Vereff alone claims the Laurel,
to the Wonder of thofe who knew him when he painted Flowers: For,
if ever a Painter excelled in that Branch, he was the Perfon: Neither
Mario da Fieri, Father Segers, or de Heem came up to luch a Pirch;
and yet, thro' a bad Exchange, he at laft fell from an agreeable spring
into a forrowful Winter, wherein he perished. I bring this Example
for two Reafons: Firft, in Confirmation of my Affertion, that he, who
can perform the moft difficult Things, may ealily, even without Trow-
ble, artain thole of less Confideration; but not the contrary without
Difadrantage and Discredis. Secondly, Becaufe my Delign is to treat
of Flewers, as an effectual Admonition to thofe who would bellow their
Time with Advantage on that fingle Choice.
Fhair painting is certainly a commendable Etudy; but, as there are
double and fingle Flowers, to there are two Sorts of Flower-painters;
the one fingular and timple, and the other rich and ingenious; of which
latter Sort we have bur few, and of the former Abundance. Three
Things are efpecially necelfary in a good Flower-picce Firtt,
Ctvice and beautiful Flowers: Secondly, Good Disposstion and Harmony:
Ard lafly, Aest and feft Penciling. Firtt, The Flowers mult not be poor
beautiful, and in Eyteem. Secondly,
or mean, but fuch as are large,
they alwayskeep their proper Quility
That, whether lying or flanding,
and Shage, i. e. that the Round frem not, by too extravagant a Spread,
to be Tilangular, squire or oblong, whereby to miffake one Flower for an
other; that the mot noble and beautiful have the Predeminancy, and
that, by their placing, they produce an agreeable Mixture of Colours, de

each Flower be well expressd, according to it's Nature and Quality;
as, one thin, another thick, this foft and limber, that fet and fliff, one
thining, another dull and gloflels.
We are, in the next Place, to fuppofe, that it is impoffible to be a
Matter without a firm and exaft Draught, and thorough Acquaintance
with Perspective, together with good Knowledge of the Colours and their
Bodies, and which will fand beft; and laftly, a due inquiry into the
Nature of Flowers, that they may be bundled accordingly.
He who would follow this Study in good earnelf, ought to be Mlafter of
a Flower-garden, which he should carefully cultivate, that he may, in
the Seafons, be furnished with fine and choice Flowers: For tho' model-
ling be a great Affiftance in Winter Practice, when the Life is not to
be had, yet no Perfection is attainable without the Life. He who is
a firm and nimble Draftiman, and a good Manager of Water-colours,
has a double Advantage, and may in Time get a Treafure of beauti-
ful modelled Flowers, bearing good Prices and great Etteem among the
Curious. After the Flowers, the green Leofing of them is of great im-
portance, thro' irs various Qualities and Difference in Textare and Co-
Jour, cauling a Flower-piece to look natural and more decorous.

Places loofe Sprigs and Leaves projecting from the Ground, and returning
their proper Shadesthereon (which tho' the Life is not to be had, may by
some such mude Tkings be performed) that they may seem more nacurally
to hang off. Such Flowers and Leaves ought to be Rrongly and boldly
handled, but yer to as to feem faftened to the Work; well confidering
the Colour and Lighmess or Darkness of the Ground, and chuling for
it Flowers of fuch Colours, that fome may look as if picking to it, and
others coming of. Now, if many Feffoons be to hang in fuch a Place,
or Room, they muft needs have a like Length, Breadch, and Fullnets,
and be placed equally high or low. What Difference is it to us, whe
ther the Proprietor defire to have Flowers or Fruits, or a Mixture of
both ? Forthe Feffoons may be filled with Peaches, Apricocks, Mul
berries, Plumbs, cec. hanging on their Twigs. Over the Repretents-
tion of a Bacchanal, fome Bunches of white and blue Grapes, intermixed
with Pine -apples, look becoming. On the lcove may hang loofly

C H A P. III. That a Flower-painter should underfland Perspeltive:
Also the Mistake of reprefenting Things improperly.
E have already afferted, that a good Flower-painter mull needs
underfland Perspective; and yet (which is to be lamented) few
know any thing of it; poffibly fuppoting, they have no Occation for it,
and that therefore this Branch is to much eafier than Hiffors or any
Thing elfe, which cannot fubliff without Perspective, as indiffutably re-
quiring more By-works, viz. Architelture, Landship, or other Ob-
jelt cauting Ground shades, which never happen in their Work: And
should they at any time be non-plusd, they canger Help from thofe who
are acquainted with Perspective. If therefore they have but a Point of
Sight, they think that fufficient; and yet not for the Sake of the Flowers,
but folely for the Corner of a marble Table or Slab, whereon they fet
a Flowerglats, as if the lighting or thading of the Flowers were a Mar-
ter of indifference; this from a side, that fronting, one from below,
another from above; whence their Pieces have ufually many Points
of Sight, sometimes as many as there are Flowers. But it cannot be
otherwife, fince they often paint after Models; placinga Flower on
the left Side, which ffood before on the right, and the contrary, or elfe
below or above; which they imagine nobody will difcover, becaute
they cannot fee it themfelves.
Another ridiculous Cultom of fome Flower-painters, in my Opinion,
is, that, in painting anr gloffi Rodies, fuch as Flower-glalies, gold, fil
ver or copper Vales, afrer the Life, they fail not to thew therein the
Panes of the Winmbes, and afcerwards to hang the Pictures in Halls
and Galleries, which have nene. Here let me take Notice of an ex-
traordinary nice and finith’d Piece of that Nature, painted by a certain
known Gentlewoman, wherein not only fome Stalks of the Flowers
appeared naturally through the Glats, but allo ber own Picture in ber
Postare of painting, with luch an Air, as evidently thewed it was the
who fat in it; nor did the forger to reprefent allo the Windores and
Panes, Sky and Clouds. We need not quettion, whether the endeavoured
by the Depth of her Penetration, to turpats her Mlafter in that Piece
of Work. This Cale is a- kin to that of a certain young Arciff, who

kind him: People could not be perfwided twas a Looking glats, tho'

C H A P IV. Of Flowers on all Sorts of Grounds.
H AT Wbite is fet off by Black, and the contrary, needs no De-
monttration; and, on the other Hand, White on White, and Black
on Black caules a picking tegether. Of which parricular Notice ought
to be taken, that Flowers may have their des Force and Effect; to or-
dering them, that fome seem to pick to the Ground, and others to come
of from it. The moll proper Grounds for Flowers are thefe.
The Colour of blue lomb-fione
Dark-olive or green Serpentine.
Lightgrey Freeitone.
Thire Marble, but of a second Tint
This Obtervation would rather lfoil a good Ordonnance than have
the defired Effect, if we did not maturely wegh, what Ufes we would
put thefe Grounds to, as allo where the Flowers most properly ought
to have the greatett Strength, and where the greateff Wcahnels, in or
der that the Principaf (1 mean, the lxed Stone and Wood worn) may
not thereby be overpowered. I lay Strength, with re-pett to Force and
Beauty; but i mean not by Wesknys, that the Colour, Light or shade
should be weakened or fullied : However I thall, in the Scquel, explain
what I meanby that Word.
Any Cobur fuits in White; but the darket moft beautifully. Warm
Colours are preferable to the broken ones, and the mot weak ought to
be on the Excremities; but few whice ones, and thofe with Caution.
What I now tay concerns the Dispesstion; which I shall more plainly
handle in treeting of Feffoons and Croups of Flowers.
The black Groands, tho' quite different from the preceding with re-
ped to great Force, can give little Reffexion, and therefore do not ad
mit of light or weak Flowers; but nevertheless fall under the fame
Rules and Obfervations as Flowers on a white Ground; becaute the
Greens, by their Union, have a Relacion to the Ground and Colour.

Red and Tellow fuit not but with dark Grounds.
All Flowers and Greens look well on a grey Ground.
ll wenk Flowers, as Violet, light Purple; Blue, Apple-bloffom and
White, agree with a warm Ground.
Flowers have a particular Decorum on a gold or filver Ground;
and Rill greater on Copper or Bronze, by Reafon of their darkith
Luttre; fiace the Colour of Gold is too frong, and that of Silver, too
pale.

C H AP. V. Of the Dispisstion of Flowers and their Colours in Fe-
Hoons and Groups.
A VIN Ghitherto treated of Flowersin general, we shall now
proceed to their Disposstion in Groups and Feftoons.
I Chall compofe each Group of particular emblematic Colours, as Tet
low, Red, Purple, Violet, Blue and White; which I confider as follows.
The firft Group, Tellow, having for its principal Flower, a Turnfol,
Africanor Marigeld, Anemone, Sc. which 1 Rile, Upper-power or
Eternity.
The second, Red, as Peonies, Papavers, Roses, Eoc. fignifying Power
or Might.
The third, purple Flowers, Rofes, Papavers, Tulips, Eec. implying
Nobility.
The fourth, Viclet, as Fritillaria or Fricillary, Coc. figaifying Incen-
HanC).
The fifth, Blue, as Iris, Convolrolus or Bind-weed, Ec. implying
Consiancy.

of a particular Colour, yer they will admit of other small ones, about
them, of various Colours fuiting therewith; as,
With the Tellow, Purple, Violet and Blue.
Red, Light-yellow, Apple-bloffom, dark Blue and White.

Twe capital Colours, as deep Vellow, Vermition or Blue, mult nover
be placed by or upon one anotber.
Hbife luitsany where, except on deep Fellow or deep Red.
Durk Green agrees with all light Flowers. And
Pale Green, with dark Ffowers.
Ender thele Groups, there should always be either a Motte or Verso.
As for Fgjoons, they may be handled in the fame Manner, yet with
lets Coannement: If the emblematic Colour have but the middle Place,
that is fufficient; the other Parts may be filled up with fuch Colours
as we pleafe, provided they have fomewhat less Brightness than the
principal: For Initance, let the middle Flowers be large and high
coloured, as Africans or Marigelds, Tellow and Red; on the right side
may be Purgh, as Rofes, Anemones; and on the left Blue, as Iris, Fles
Principis, Hyscinths, Cc. The Purple Side mixed with lirle White
and lets Fellow; the Blue Side, with Fellow and Red; and the 7of.
low in the Middle, wich Violer, dark Blue, litle Purple and White.
in a second Feffoon, White may poticts the middle Place, as white
Roses, Lillies and orters; on the right side may be Tellow, and on
the left pale Red. The Tillow may be diverfified with Purple, Vio.
let and dark Blue; the Red with pale Vellow, Whire, Violet and dark
Blue; and the Whire in the Middle, wth Rofe-colour, Violet; Purple
and beautiful Red.
In the Middle of a third Feltoon, may be Red, as Prbavers, Anenones
C5r. On the right side, striped Flowers of Pu-ple and Vellow, Violet
and pale Fellow, diverfined with dark Elue and beautiful Red; but on
the other side, all plain Flowers.
The Wrire may be intermixt with Flowers of any Colour, exceptlight.
Fellow.
The intermixture contitts of small Fowers: Bur the single coloured,
whether in the middle or largeft, as allo thole on the Sides require their
Particular small divernifying Flowers, i. c. the fingle coloured with
ipeckled or Itriped; and the contrary.
if either Group or Fedoon, fuit or close Flowers should always be
placed in the mor refiered Part. The open ones are moftly fer on the
Sides, in order to create Sbade. For Inilance; let the middle Part of
a Fefloon have the largeft, fincf and fulled Flowers, fuch as red and
white Rofes, Paparers, (Gc. Between the Middle and the Extremities, a
lefter Sort, as Tulips, Anemones, Narciffufes or Duffodils, Gilli-fowers,
Malra Rofes, ec. Further towards the Extremities, the more long and
lmaller ones, as Aragalus, Ranunculas or Crow-foot, Convelvolus, Fles

Principis, Borage, Barbarum nigri, Violets, E8c. On the Relief of
the Feftoon, between the largelt and middle Sort, may be a Mixture
of the smallet Flowers. If the middle Flower be Tellow, thole further
off ought to be Purple or Red, and fuch as are towards the Corners,
White and Blue; the longer the weaker, that the sirengest Colour may
keep the Middle. Bur if White have the middle Place, the other Parts
mult not ecliple it with Tellow and Red.
A compleat Feffoon mult have an orderly Difpolition, not only with
relpelt to the Flowers themfelves, whether large or fmall, but allo in
the placing of double and fingle ones: s firit, white Refes and Cen-
tiselia, next single Roses; and lattly wild Blossoms.
As for the Colours, there are fingle and half teleared Flswers: The
fingle-coloured are Peonies, Rofts, CSc. And the others striped or
speckled with two or more Colours; as Anemones with White and Red,
Hriped Rofes, Tulips, Eec. Which ought to be to regularly ordered, as to
raile in the Eyea ballancing Mixture; and to unite the frong and weak
that the one do not project coomuch, and the other too little; and that, at
a Diftance, and at one View, the Feffoon may have its due Sway. Vet
if here or there it be either too weak or too Rrong, you mult recollet
how it may be helped. Wherefore obferve, that Tellow. and Red. are
firong Colours; and contrarily, Blue and Viclet weak. 1I too much Tel.
low and Red come together, place fomewhat Blue or Vigket between;
and if too much Blue or Violet, some Tellow or Red.
To begin a Feftoon well, you ought firtt to mark- out its Course.
as you will have it, either thick or thin: Next, lay on the Green
with fuch Leafing as you think proper, but fomewhat large, and
with due Light and Shade according to its Light. Being dry, lay in the
Plowers flat, firft the principal, each in its Place, with a fingle Colour,
red, blue or vellow, of such a Tint as will beft admit of painting
upon it, the Light and Shade after the Life or Models. The Flowers
between, with their Leafing, are put in over the Green, on finithing.
The Grounds, whether plain or in Bals relief or other Ornament, ought
to be neatly finithed with the sirt Green, to fave you the Trouble afti
cerwards of paring away fomething here and there.

C H A P. Vi. Continuation of the ordering and placing the Flowers.
1VI w O Obfervations of Confequence in a Feffoon, Cronp, or Gar
land, fill remain; to wit, the ordering the Flowers and their
Places of Hanging.
Tis ealy to conceive, that many small Tbings coming fegether, produce,
at 2 Diftance, only a confuted Mass, and little affect the Senfes, as hav-
ing nothing in them to make any impreffion, or is worth Remark:
And tho' each Flower have is particular Name, Shape, and Colour,
yet they are only considered in general, under the Nume of Flowers; be
canle of their being placed either fee high or foo diffast. Such Feftoons
of Croups look well on Paper and in Hand, of on Tea-tables, Toilets
and the like, either in Painting or Needle-work. On the other Hand,
large Flowers may be feen diflnctly at a Distance, in their Qualities,
Shapes, and Beauries Theneach Flower gers a Name; this is a Rofe,
that a Papover, C8r. in a Word, Feftoons, Groups or Garlands, placed
high, or to be viewed at fome Diftance, ought to be difpoted in great
Maffes, and separate, with few speckled or priped Flowers, eitber large
or smatt, as having no Eiffelt but when feen near. Wherefore tis ne
ceffary to take, in their Sreads, others of fingle Colours, in order to fet
off the Work with mere Forse and Diffinttion, and to give the Eye Sais
faction For this Reafon, when sees in Hand, they ought to unite, and ont
of Hand, to look more feparate and difinct. Bur I shall explain this by
some Examples; chuling two Groups, one agreeably amiring, fo as to
be viewed sear, and the other, the contrary
in the middle of the former is a wbite Rese, andbehind it a Centifelid,
behind which is a Purple, and behind that a Peony. Now, thefe four
Colours difter but half s Tint from each other, compoting together an
half Ball gradually rounding.
The latter contrarily, tho' having allo a white Flower in the middle,
has behind it a purple one, and benind that a dark Viclet, a Colow
cdarker than that of the Peony: And thefe will create a greater Forfe
than the former, as ftarting more suddenty from each other, and differing
2 whole Tint, as the others did but an half one. Whence, tisevidest,
that the more difintt the Tints are, the more lively and firong they wil
appear.

happen to be of different Sixes, and therefore requiring more Flowers.
I divide them thus.

Tellow. The other Side the fame.

Red. The other Side the fame.
The Fifih.
in the Middle Viclet, next Orange and other Tellow, then Blue,
Red and Violet. The fame on the other Side.
The three laft ought to be intermixed with White, and the two firt
with Variety of Colours, as it beft fuits, in order to unite the Parts
with each other.
Three Sorts of Flowers are preper for Intermixture, viz. Tellow, Red
and Blue, all in their greateft Beauty.
If the Work confill moftly of Red and Tellow, it ought to be inter-
mixed with Blue; and if of Blae, you mult take Tellow; but if of
all three, you are to ule White, to diftriburing it as to refreth the Eye.
Now, for Proof of all that has been faid, a shill thew here two Me-
thods of great Vfc to a Flower-painter, though they may feem
trilling.
Paint all Sorts of Flowers, on Cards or Pafleboard, as rude as you
pleafe, even but a fingle Spot for each, and g or 6 of each Colour, or
as many as there are fints, Red, Blse, Purple, Vellow, Violet. Let
thele be capital Flowers. Next, make (maller Ones, for Intermixture,
of Red, Blue, Vellow and White, as beautiful as poffible. Cuc all
thefe afunder, and lay each Colour orderly by itfelf in a little Box.
Then paint up a green Feftoon or Group on Pafteboard; and thereon
place luch Flowers as you pleafe, shifring and changing them according
to your Delign. And thus you will perceive the Truch of what has

The Art of Engroving is queltionlets noble and praife worthy;
becaute it respects Painting, as Painting does Nature: For as the
latter has Nature for ir's Modelor Object, which it faichfully imitaces
with the Pencil; to Engraving likewife copies Painting, either with
the Needle or Graver, in fuch Manner as only to fland in Need of Co
lours; which, when required, may be added to it. Painting confifts
in a near and good Outline, Propertion, Light and Shade: And thele
are alto the Foundations of Engraving. Painting diffinguithes between
common Light and Sunthine: Engraving does, or can do, the fame.

that is Praife-worthy: And as the intire Welfare, even Happiness or
Uphappiness of a good Painter, depends on the Gertainty or Uncertainty
of the Engraver, as I shall fhew in my Remarks on Prints after Paint
ings or Deligns; to the latter ought to difengage himself from Preji-
dice and inclnation to this or that particular Manner, and exert his
Skill in an exaft Imitation of what he is to Engrave of Etch, after any

graving is very great. The Management of the Needle is the same
20
with thar of Chalk or the Pen: The Place lies ffat and firm like the
Paper to draw upon. But we find the contrary in Engraving; wherein
the Graver is held almod parallel with the Plate, and the larter is
moreable on a Cuikion or Sandbag. And as to Force, there is alloless
Occafion for it in Erching than Engraving.
Now to prove, that Etching mutt needs be more Deligner-like than
Engraving, let us only make our Remarks on both in the Courte of
their Bulinets, each having a Delign before him; and then we shall find
the Reafon to be, that in the one, both the Drawing, and Plate are
ixt before the Arcid, and he only moves his Hand; whereas the otper
cannor go forward wirhout firring, the Plate beingcontinually rurning,
and boch the Hund and Arm employed in directing the Graver; by
which Means, Engraversare often hindered from perceiving the Dit-
terence berween their Work and the Pattern, before a Part, nay. the
whole, be tiniined. Wherefore, in my Opiniph,. Eiching is Ixperior te

therein; becaute of the flow Advances in Engraving compared to Etch-
ing, whether in Figures or Buildings, but elpecially Landskip. And
fince Painters of Deligners care not to have their Defigas cenfured and
corrected by others, they chufe rather to erch them themfelves, than
to fet about Engraving; an Art not to be maftered without much Ex-

whereby it would become rather Labour than Diverfion.
Many Engravers etch for Pleafure, becaute of its Eafiness; but fel.
dom any Etcher handles the Graver, unless in Cafe of Neceffity. To
this perhaps it may be objected, that, as each Painter or Deligner has a
particular Choice wherein he labours moft, as one in the Ordonnance,
another in Nicety of Drafc, and a third in the neat finithing of fome
Particular Things, therefore the Tiule of Designer-like in Etching, is
not ablolutely due to Painters or Deligners: To which 1 anfiver, that
undoubtedly the Word muft not be underftood to relate to modern De-
figners, becaute it was in Ufe before Erching was brought to its prefent
Perfection; as appears by Caracci, Titian, Antome Temperta, C3c.

praife-worthy, for the Encouragement and Confideration of the less
Knowing. Whereby we plainly perceive, that their incention was only
to putforth their own Performances in such a Manner as fafely to be re-
lied on; accordingly, we fcarce fee any more in them than an Out line:
But this is to firm and correlt, that, however tlightly the other Parts
may be feratcht, thefe Works thus of their own Hands, are more
valued than thofe of the belt and molt famous Engravers or Etchers.
We have an Example in the Print of the Woman by the Well, eicht by
Caracot himself, how much it differs from that done by Le Potre, and
another by Bishop. Whata vaft Difference is there between Perrier's
and Bishop’s Works, as to the Deligner likencts and Loofencts of Hand
ling! And in Landskips, between Titians and Perelles: I could, if
need required, produce more Proofs of the Anciquity of the Word
Defgner-like; but shall wave them; and acquaint the Reader, how
oddly I took to Etching, and how ftrangely I drudged, before I could

foorly engraved Prints of Raphael, Michael Angele, Taul Veronefe,
Tintoret, (Ec. (Which yet were excellent for their fine Out-line) and few
erchr ones; my flender Actempts may be eatily gueff at. Indeed I cannor

Eit a Piece of Pewter and a Nail, about a Fingers Length, which, with
great Pains, I ground to a Point after my own Way. Firtl, I tried on-
iy lingle Strokes, and then croli-hatching, which looked ftrange enough.
Ar.S, inficad of a Rollirg-prets, I rubbed the Bickfides of my Proots
with the Nail. This however did not abate my Curiofity; which
Csilv increated, tho' my Work appeared to black as to be fcarce intel-
lisitie. My Father, feeing this, could not forbear laughing; and, for
Hemour's Sake, gave two or three of my Proofs to Bartbolet, and he
agzin to Nstalis the famous Engraver, who beffowed on me some little
Ihitructien and a fmall Copper-plare to try on. But what Drudgery
hed 1 urdergone before 1 ferarcht this beautiful Plate: Boses Book of
Eiching happening to be publifhed about that Time, Ileft off plaguing
myfelf, and cheerfully fer about (plitting of Wood, providing Needles,
boiling Grounds, cleaning Plates, buying Aqua fortis. Wax, E8c.
When before, Iknew of no betrer Ground than thick and foul Oil, out
of the Smuth-por, boiled to a Blacknets; which gave me no little
Trouble to get off the Plsteagain after it was bit, and which therefore
I was obliged to put in the Fire, till it was foff as Lesd. Things fo
far facceeding according to my With, I happened to fee some Prints of
Vouet, from France, which fpurred my Curioficy: And I should cer
fainly hive made early and good Progress, had not my Father been fear-
full might fix my Thoughts on this Study, to the Negleft of Painting.
Wherefore he diffuaded me from it, faying, it was too foon to enter on
to difficule a Pallime, and inftrating me in other Things as delightful
25 advantageous. Marrying some Years after, I went to Helland,
where Ire-affumed this noble Art with great Pleafure, and which I do
not repent of; tho' some think it the Caufe of my Misfortune. The
Trath of this, Ged knows: Vet had 1 faved Candle and ufed more
Day-light for it, perhaps my old Age might have proved more com-
fortable to me: Butalas! thofe two noble Sifters, Painting and Eich-
ifg, are now vanifhed with my Sight.
Let the Readerjudge, whether he ever heard of a firanger Way of
Eiching. However, I mention it here to thew, that a diligent Man,
getting

getting better Inftruction, may in Time gain his Point. Its certain,
that few young Men would have had Patience enough to drudge as 1
did, without inftruction; but that an induftrious Tyro, after leaving
his Mafter, may postibly improve through Diligence and Study is very
natural; even to as to excel him in Neatness, Smoothness and Expedi-
tion, as well in Erching as Engraving, 1 mean, in the Use of the Graver
and Needle, but not in Knowledge. By Knowledge 1 undertland,
keeping the Likeness of a beautiful Face, Hands and Feet, according
to what we fay in the fecond Chapter, that the Knowledge confifts in a
correlt Our-line, Proportion, Light and Shade, and Peripective: For
we commonly fee the greatell Faults committed in the aforelaid Parts,
for want of Knowledge, and not inuring themfelves to drace by Hand
large Things after small, and the centrary,, but accultoming them-
felves to squaring; a Practice not difficult to a Swincherd'’s Boy, if he
underffood the Divition of Squares and Management of Chalk. But they
may yet be erroneousenough in tracing their Object on the Plate, though
drawn upon Squares; for, miffing the Out-line in the leaft, either inwardly
of outwardly, it prefently becomes too lirtle or too big: But the Tyro
cannot fee this for want of due Knowledge: And tho' he may be fen-
fible, that here or there he has a little miffed the Our-line, yet he
palles it over as a Matter of no great Moment; and if he propofe to
help it in the Erching or Engraving, he may poffibly forget it before
he come to far in the Work: He commonly thinks no farther than
what is already on the Plate. Whence we may eafily conclude, that he
who knows not what conflitutes Beaury, can be as little fenlible that a
mall Difference in a Face, rm or Hand is of any great Confequence.
Another Difficulty, no less than the former, is, that tho', the Tyro have
the Out-line correctly drawn on the Plite, yet he may ranover it when
he comes to sbade or batch. And as this frequently happens, I shall here
give the Reafon of it.
In either Engraving or Eiching any Thing, the Off-work, whether
Buildings, Landskip or even the Grounds, ought always to be begus
fift, that, by referving the principal Things for the laft, the Hand may
be prepared to handlethem with more Boldness. Now, the Tyro being
to eagrave or etch a Ground behind his Figure, be it naked or dreft, he
will not only (especially in Engraving) end his Harching againtt the
Out-line, but fomerimes exceed it; whereby the Parts, whether Arm,
Leg or Hand, muff needs lofe their true Proportion and Quality: And

lows are made even and confequently fliff and formal Neverthelefs
the Work goes on; and when they come to fee the Miftake, they fcrape,
burnith and rub to bring it right again; which I grant is well enough
in cafe of Need. But alas! How feldom is it prattifed? If it be fome-
thing of no great Contequence, it remains as it was, without further
Iafpedion. Thisl know, not by Hearfay bat Experience. Wherefore
they, who have an laclination for Engraving, should apply to a Painter
for lattraction in beautral Proportion, and in drawing every Thing by
Hard, wheeker Prints, Drawings, Paintings, Plailter-figures, even the
Lite xtolf. For Painters firff reach the Theory, or Knowledge of Pro
pertion, and then the Practice of Colouring; whereas many Engravers
begin with the Pridice or Handling.
As for the straping, turnisbing, and rubbing eut before-mentioned,
it is a Point which ought to be well underftood, becaufe it affets
not either the too great Darkneis or Hardnets of the Hatching, but the
Ost-line; as I shall thew by the Example of the Faces in Plate
IXII.
In the Pace A, the hatch’d Ground runs over the Outline of the
Check; whereby it appears more funk in, as in that of B, and thus
the Out-line is loff. Now, this Face being to be finithed, and the
Check brought right again, to much muft be fcraped off within the
Line, as to give the Check irs former Swell; and if the Face be
a fourth Part less, the Difference will be to much the greater, epc-
cially in a Portrait, and greater sill if it be in Profile; as Face C
thews, wherein we fee, how little foever be taken off with the Ground
from the Tip of the Nofe, Mouth and Chin, it will produce another
Aspect: Whence tis evident, what a vall Alceration this muft caute
in the Likenets.
in this Art as well as Painting, it is a conflant Rule to begin
with the Ground or Back-work; and Engravers and Erchers do it for
the fame Reafon as Painters: For, when the principal Figures are fr-
nished, the whole Piece is reckoned as good as done: The general Re.
ronching is only to bring Harmony or Keeping into the Work; here
fomewhar more Strength, there more Faintness, (Oc. But what we
now fpeak of, to wit, Scraging, concerns Engraving only; whereas,
in Etching, nothing is done but stopping, unlets Things are already

If it be asked, whether what is flopped up can be repaired before
tis bit; as in A, when the Hatchings which takes away the Swell
from the Checks, is stopped up with Stop ground, whether then the
former Roundness cannot be again ferch’d out, with a fine Needle, on
the same Ground, that all may bite together? I antwer, that this will
make bad Work: But if fomething be wanting, it muft be touched
up with the Graver. However, I shall thew another Method: Make
a Burnither pretty hot, and rub it gently and speedily over the Part you
would have out, and then it will clofe up the Harching, to that you
need neither to fop up nor bite. Now etch thereon what is neceffary.
and thus all may be bit at once. Thefe Osfervations, especially that
of not carelessly spoiling the Out line, as in the Examples A and C, are
very needful.
Let any Perfon now confider, how litile a fine Ordonnance of a fi-
mous Mafter, when put out of Hand in fuch a Condition, can te like

that without the former Knowledge it is imposfible to become a good

becaute it makes every Thing appear in its Nature and Quality,

each of which, in Engraving and Erching, require 2 particular Ex-
presion Vet in Erching tis more expeditious, especially if you can

Rerein. The St. Bruno of Bartholct, engraved by Natalis, is admirable
for the Naturalnets, which, by particular Harchings and the utmoff
NNeAEef, appears therein.
Now, when a great Artiff has shewed his utmoft Skill in a Plate,
and ail Things are worked according to Rule, yer we find it almoff im-
Poffible to make People fenfible what true Art is, and wherein the Know-
ledge of a geol Print lies; moft Men now a days being taken with

the Engraver happen to hit the Delign, the Mafter claims the Howour;
but, on Pailure, the Engraver is fure of bearing the Scandal. For
this Reafon, it were to be withed, that Engravers would, before they
begin a Plate after fuch a Drawing or Skerch, confult the Painter or
Defigner, for a Refolution of all their Doubts, and that they might
proceed with Certainty.
1 alfothink it not only ufeful but necellary, that the Deligner be par-
ticular in his Exprestion of all the Materials: For Inftance, that the
Bafement fory of a Building thew to be of rough Stones, the Columns
and Pilafters with the lmagery and Ornaments of Marble, &c. that the
Engraver may exhibit the former Rough by broken Strotes, and what is
fnooth and pelished by neat and more curious ones with the Graver;
Erching the By-works fomewhar coarfer again; the Wood-work with
long and broken Strokes bumouring the Gram; the Trees, according to
the Courfe of the Boughs and Sway of the Leafing; the Grounds, Serpen-
fine, and alfo broken. Thef: Obtervations ought to be heeded in o ye-
ral as well as in the Particulars, together with the Diminution of the
Offskip; yet not in the Manner of fome, by wide Strokes, but by clasing
and making them finer. On this Footing, there would be less Complaint
of the Defgners, and thefe not think themfelves injured on feeing their
Defigns to ill followed. Things thus worked according to Rule
would certainly prove fine, and the more, in a Work of Confequence
and bearing a Price: Tho, to one who underflands his Bufinels, this:
Management is no more Trouble than the contrary.
I have feen Drawings of Goktzixs, wherein he had plainty expresed
all the parirular Objects. The tender or (mooth Bodies were well
wased, allo neatly (cumbled with red or black Chalk. What was
rough and cearfe, he had handled boldly with the Pen or black Chalk;
by which Means, the one appeared darker, and the other lighter in the
Shade, as if it were a Picture. But tis no wonder that we fee not fuch.

And as a good Painter confiders what ought to be Stone, Wood, Fless,
White or Black, before he colours, to Goltxins did the fame, when he
Wasto engrave any Thing. He would exprets every Thing in his Pa:-
terns, tho' he was ever fo certain of his Art, in order to do his whole Work
aller a llight Skerch, and that notbing might efcape him; on a Belief
that we ought not to truff to our Memories in a Matter of Conlequence.

Mcthod cannot be good: Harching looks better, and has mare Affinity

you find this will nor do, then you may, with a finer Needle, continue
the same Harching fomewhat further: But a better Method would be,
to lay it of once as far it ought to be, and then somewbat to Hop up
the Ends or Extremities. He, who negleds this, is obliged to make
thift with fifging; yet that mutt not be too closs. The beft Way is,
firff, with a fine Needle, to continue the Harching a little further, and
then, with a finer, to extend it till if come to nothing; which we call
broken Haiching, as was old Vifcher'’s Way in his Boors after Cfade,
whereby he pretily expreffed the Colour of a Face, and fetched out

make it your Practice, you need not Rop to foften the Hatching; for
the Points thus lengthened anfiver the same Purpose; and then you
can proceed with Certainty, especially if you ufe the fame Needle with
which the Hatching is continued in the Light, round the Relief; the
Shades again ought to be fofcened with the fame Needle that made
them: Then the slipping of the large Needle in the Shade will not be
100 visible: Fet, would you work the laft sipping in the Light with
a fimaller Needle, you may; but, becaufe the Shade ends more fuddenly
than the Relief in the Light, I should ufe no others; for the Ripping
is a nice Point to him who will be curious. The Stips ought allo
to be equal, 1 fay, equally diffant, and not to come between the Ex-
tremities of the Strokes. If it be asked, whether any Thing, harch’d
teo wide, can be darkened with slipping intlead of a third Stroke?
My Opinion is, that it. may ; and that any flight Thing can be per-
formed in this Manner: But the Work is more tedious. Things to
touched up look very neat: For by Hrong Strokes, fainter ones, more
foint and Points, we can very commodioufly darken an Object more or
lets at pleafure. Bonlanger has, in my Opinion, over-slipp’d his
Prints; which makes them look rather like Ministure than any Thing
elle; whereforeI cannot much commend hipping: And why: Becouse of
the Inequality and Hungriness of the Points or Stips, occasioned by
touching one barder than anoiber, whereby, in biring, one penciraies.
the Copper more than another, be the Dot ever fo small Add to
this, the impesfibilny of making the stips perfectly round. They will
always be more or less lengish; as may be easily proved by a magnify-
ing Class.
I have feen, in engraved Prints of Gotteins, the faint Tint upon
the Relief cross -harch’d, as well as in the Shade; but this is only pro-
per for Engraving, effecially in Hligh Fmishing; becaufe, in Eiching,
the Crotshatching expreffes a coming Shade, and then it may be
very well effected by Hipping, as brosd-lighted Objects want not fo
much Darknets in the Light.
Now, if any Thing should happen to be amiss, and you
would beat it out and mend it, take a Proof and fatten it nestly be-
hind your Plate, and then beat out what you would have away. This
may be Done even to an Hair; and if you care not to firike on the
Paper; you may mark the Place with a sharp Point on the Copper,
to as to fee it; which will do as well, though the fpoiling a Proof
is but a Trifle: Vet the Proof, when once dry, is no more fit forthis

from the Press. For,
being werted again, it will always be uncertain,
and unlike the Plate. In order to find thefe lictle Places of mishir
Spors with ftill greater Eafe (a Mechod which many Engravers make
a Secret of) take a fine Thread or String, and put it crosswife about
the Plate, tring it on the Edges, to that the Center of the Cross

Backlide upwards, on a imooth and hard Stone, beat the Place gently
with a pointed Hammer; and then, with fome Stuff taken from the

1& Fanding, to 1 think Basereless call for it: For manr, who
can eich well after a fine Pifture or Drawing, are at a Loss when
ther come to imitace and reprefent a Batsreliet. They lay the Strokes
therein as in other Objects; tho', in my Opinion, the Difference be
very great; especally, if we would not handle them in the Manner
of Perrier and Pictro Sanrs, but according to Rule; tho' the former
underflood in the bed of the two, fince his Works better preserve ite
Stoniness and Design; and yer, he has added some Things of his own:
But the other has done it to fuch Excgs, as thereby to render his

per for Stone, and more like Gold, Sil, or or Bronze; appearing better
in a Print than in Stone. In my Opinion, Sany underftood not the
Naked, Proportion, Mukeling, or Mocion; wherefore I cannot by anj
means allow him the Preference. The Trurh is, they are good for a
Drawing; but were they to be compared with the Life, we should df
cover a great Difference. In the next Place, it is abfurd to imagise

below; frenting, even from all Sides; and I cannot think they drew
them by Candle-light, but rather shaded them as they thought
fit.
I was once asked, whether, fince the Batsreliefs fland in many dif
ferent Places, Moulds or Modets have not fometimes been taken from
them by one or other, from which they sbadowed their Drowings, dit-
poting thefe Models, asufual, in a left or right Light, as they thought
proper: Which is not improbable. We might likewife light fome
from above, others from below, from a Side, frenting and from be-
kind, in order to ufe them on any Occation; which would be a great
Help to thofe who know little or nothing of Modelling.
We have faid, that we think the Bassreliefs of Perrier better in
Design than thofe of Pietro Sanci, but much inferior in Finishing; tho'
the Works of the latter, for the Reafon before affigned, have na ff
finity with the Stoniness. And yet tome think, that were the Figures
 or 4 Feet high, they would have another Look; for then the Parts
would appear more grand; and thole of Perrier on the other Hand,
too flim and dull; which 1 do not difown: Neverthelels it muft be a
greed, that this Obfervation is good, in order to thew the Difference
between carving in Stone, and chasing in Gold, or Silver. But itslike
wife true, that had Perrier finithed his Drawings as well as Santi, they
would have been much finer and more ufeful: For its eafier to leave
out Superffuities than make Addicions. Iis not improbable, that Suntis
Intention, by his Method of Management, was, that he might
be of greater Service to Painters, Statuaries, and Chafers than Per-
rier.
We have affirmed, that Pietre Santi has possibly added much of his
own. Now, it is alfo not unlikely, that Perrier drew his Objects from
a greater Diffance than Santi, whereby he could not fee all the minute
Parts: And I cannot but at the fame Time think, that Santi defigned
moft of his Bats reliefs affer undamaged Within door-Work, in Halls,
Chambers, and other inclofed Places; whereas Perrier poffibly took his
from Without door-Work, luch as Pediments, Froncifpieces, Frizes and
the like, half eaten up by the Weather. We might kill fubjoin, that Per.
rier worked only to thew the World that fuch excellent Things were at
Rome, and at the fame Time to difplay his light and firm Manner
of Drawing; whereas Santi had not only a View to Profit, but allo
to be generally ufeful to curious Artifts and others. How true this is
let the Pirtuess determine.

As to the right Hlandling of Batsreliefs, I think it abfolutely ne-
ccffary, that every Thing be etched equally coarse or fine with one and
tee Jame Ncedle, without any Difference with respect to Stuffs; as being
the beft Method for reprefencing the Stone-werf welf; unless it were
bit a grey one with a Fore-ground and Offskip, when the Strokes ought
to diminith of grow faint, according to Perspettive.
There is likewife lirtle Obfervation made about the Lights of Pass-

I S to be wondered, that, among the many Arts and manual

Operations, Engroving is to little, and Etching fo much treated
of: The Reafon whereof is palt my Apprehention. Many Painters
and Lovers, for the Encobragement of thole who would make it their
Bufiness, or to fhew their Skill, have earneftly firove to fay fomething
of it. But no Engraver has, to my Knowledge, undertaken the Task;
poffibly, as not thinking themfelves fufficient for it; or elfe becaute
they would keep it as a Secret from each other. But the moff pro
bable Reafon, as I think, is, the late Appearance of this Art; which
is evident, fince the Remans till their latter Times knew nothing of
Irs certain, that Engraving, as well as Painting, is founded as much
on Iecory as Proffice, and that both depend on eftablifhed and politive
Rules, which, if orderly followed, will make a Man a Mafter.

Iis not frange, that more Engravers have applied to Painting,
chan
Painters to Engraving; becaute the latter have to many excellent Books,
for their Encouragement, publifhed by indicious Mafters: Whereas.
Engravers have not one touching their Practice. But as every Thing has
its Time, to we mult hope for it in this.
Nam Mora dat Vires, teneras Mora concequit Uvas,
Et validas Segetes, qued fuit Herba facit.

Perfetting Time brings on the tender Grape,
And gives the berby Corn its ripning Shape.
In the mean time I shall boldly eater the Lifts, and, according to
my fmall Ability, impart what Iknow of ir: Bur the Praltice or Han
dling I shall not couch upon, as not having the greateff Skill therein:
What however I mention of it, as unavoidably necelfary to whatI pur-
pofe to fay, I fubmit to thofe of better Knowledge: Hoping my En-
deavours will not be taxed with Prefumption, fince my only Arn is,
thereby to rouze noble Geniuss, and by my fmall Spark, to Kindle a
greater Fire; according to the Latin Proverb: Parva sape Scintilla ma-
gnum excitavit Incendium.
We have before mentioned, Firft, On what Bafis Engraving is found
ed. Secondly, A good Engraver's Qualifications. Laftly, Whatcon-
Ritutes an agreeable Print. Wherefore we shall now difcuts the Ma-
nagement of the Strokes in Objects, according to their Natures and Courfes,
with respett to Perspective, and as well in Erching as Engraving, toge
ther with fome Examples for illuftrating the Point, and preventing and
correcting Millakes.
in Plate L XXl. is a Wheel marked A, having 8 Spokes, or Points;
as allo a Staf; fer upright in the Ground, croffed by the Horizon.
This Wheel thews, that each Spoke ought to have a particular Course.
according to irs Turn, and that the Scrokes muft be governed by the
Extremity of each Spoke, as may be here feen. The foremoft runs cir-
cular; the second, eval; the third, almost freight, C8c. Compare allo
the foremoll Spoke 1, with the hinder one y, how much they differ in
Force; for 1 approaches, and s recires; which cannot be otherwife
according to Perspective. Again, the Strokes drawn with a Ruler, and
running off towards the Point of Sight, grow gradually finer and
fointer. Now tho' the short or cress barching ought, by eftablished
Rule,

Rule, to be mere visible and firong than the long, yet few are obferyed
to make any Diffinet:on therein.
We have faid before, that each Object, whether Fleth, Scone,
Grounds, Csc. requires a particular Stroke; and among others, that
Wood elpecially mult be thick-fircked glong the Grain, and contequently
cress Patcred with a finer Stroke: But now we thew the contrary; for
the cress ones are frenger than those running with the Grain; which here
cannot be otherwife. If some fay that I contradilt myfelf, in making
the Crols-drokes thus againtt the Grain; I shall, for their Sarisfiltion,
thew mr Reafon for it. Obfervethen, that any Thing turned has no o-
ther Graintean what the Chizel makes; and as the Turner works againt
the Gran, and the Wood retains more or leis Marks of the Tool, it
mud be expreited accordingly in Engraving. But a fecond Queftion may
be, whether it would nor do as well, if both the Harchings were equal-
iy tre or coarle! I anfwer, ir would, as to the Sbade, but not with re-
16.T ro the Sruff. For it would be more proper to stone, Copper, Wax

and tuch like. Neverthelets thefe Obfervations are geas ally hule heed
ed, tho' allo founded on certain Rules of this Art.
As forthe Stoff, it thews, that the Srrokes, begnning round from
below, grow Breighter as they approach the Herizon; and above the
Her:zin, the same, but in a reverfed Manner.
Now let us confider the other Example, in Plate L XXl. wherein the
reiring Paragets thew the Diminution or Faminets of the Strokes, not
only in fuch, but in any other Objects, according to their Diftance and
Going off, the one in a greater the other in a lets Degree. Hereby we
may plainly difcover the perverfe Notion of some Men, namely, that
Diminaticn implies growing scanty or vider. See A with a fingle
Stroke from one End to the other. Now, alcho' the Offfrokes feem
neater than the near, yet they are not to in Falt: But as the Place di
minishes, so the Strokes close and thin, in tuch Manner, that they be:ome
aeither cleter nor more feanty. The Diminution of the Figures and the
three Tskes bears the fame Conttruction. Nevertheless, 1 am fentible,
that manr, even old Malters, do otherwife, in handling their retiring
Obje.Ts. Figures, Trees, Offship and Sky more coartly behind chan
forwards I have even obferved, that they clofe-harch the neareff and
Darkeff Sky, and work wider and wider towards the Horizon; but this
more in Erching than Engraving; poffibly to fave the Trouble of uing
2 or more Needles, or of fopping up, which is properly the Point this
Example ans at. For I do not ask here, whether it creates more
Trouble; but thew, what may poffibly be thought to be of less Mo
ment than in Fall it is: For intlance, I place the tbree Figures, No. 1, 2

gs ten or twelve Steps a part, and at the fame Diftances on the Parapet,
three Vases, alfo numbered 1, 2. 3; whereby may be plainly perceived,
how much the one differs from the other. But altho' in thefe Figures
the Meaning is fufficiently to be underflood, to wit, that the further
they are, the more fine and close the Strokes become, yer I have added the
Vafesto them for the Sake of thofe who may be curious enough to count
the Strokes. When they will find, not a Stroke more or less in the one
than the other; which in the Figures would be redious Work. Ob-
ferve, in the next Place, the Ground-sade of each Figure againtt the
Parapet, each growing faint according to ir's Diftance, and with what
Certainty the accurate Tints of the Figures may be perceived thereon;
even to Know, how much they diminish and grow finer; and at the fame
Time how much the Light differs. Bur let it not be thought fufficient,
that the Shades diminith or grow faint, and the White remain all ever
light; fince we know, that the Plan or Ground cannot thew its Levef
otherwife, than by Means of Light forwards, going off darker and
darber. For initance, were a white Figure or white Stone flanding for-
wards, and you would place fuch another further in, where the Ground
is darker, you mult govern yourfelf by the Groand where the firgt Object
fands; as being subject to the fame Rule, if Things be well finithed.
If the Plan or Ground be fnished, the Figures ought to be so likewife:
Are they airily handiel anI brordlighted, the Ground mut be the same.
And tho' the Ground, in its Colour, be more or less dark, yet that is.
not regarded in this Cae, becaule we are (peaking only of the Diminn-
tion of the Tints, confi-ing of White and Black. Suppote, the Floor
were of white Mla,ble, and the Figares the same, or in white Draperies;
the foremoft would be breadlighted, and the mere diffant less and less
White, were it even in Sun shine; nay, if the Light came from bebind,
or from assde, the most diffant would only keep an utmoft Heightening;
and Killless, were the Colours exprefied in it; as they who underftand
Perspective well know : Nor canit be otherwife; as may be feen in the
firtt Example in the Child's Handholding the End of the hindmoll Spoke,
which planly appears to have little orno Whiceness. And as for the Stuffe
of the Objects, as Linnen, Cloth and fuch like, some may rather think
them poffible to be so worked than the Nated; becaute, having already.
engraved forwards as neat and fine as may be, we can therefore further
in not express any Thing finer or neater: But1 fay, that as Things,
having the urmoft Neatness, do not become neater by Disfance, nor al.

the Histening: Bur the coarse Parts always keep their Forms. And this
Obfervation respelts not only the three Stufts, but alfo Figures, Stones,
Greands, Trees, &cc. Here tome perhaps may fay, how can the
Strokes postibly unite with the Light, when they, as they retire, ought
to be clofer and clefer, especially with the Air, (which, on the Ho-
rizon, is clear and bright and free from Clouds) unless they widen
more and more towards the Horizon, were they ever fo faint: To
which 1 anfwer, as Experience will prove, that when the Strokes thus
thin and grow fant in their going off, they certainly difappear and
he away, nay, become at latt invisible, and unite enough with the
ight, even were it Sunshine, tho' they be ever so closc. And fuch a
Length I think the Gravercan go when skilfully managed. In Etching,
he Needlecan do the fame by flopping up.
However, I queition not but my Propolition will be caxed with im-
Poffibility and purzling Novelcy, especially by fuch as are not thorough
Engravers, who may blame me for thus dilcloting the Grounds of this
roble Art, and to plainly thewing Truth: But my Anfwer, in the
irf Place, is, that I find myself obliged in Duty to do fo, fince allmy

becaute what I lay down is prelcribed by certain Rules of the Mathe.
maties; the few are sensible, that the Art of Engraving, in general,
flows therefrem, and that different Objects require different Handlings;
but rather believe, that a good Manner of Drawing will eafily lead to
Engraving: A Notion true enough in Erching, tho' even therein the
Point lies moft in the Biting and Stopping 4p. As to Engraving, you
mull certainly be converfant with the Handling and Force of the Graver;
two Pomts not to be artained without great Experience: Tho, in the
Begnning, tis better for an Ercher to have no Handling at all; becaute
he may then gradually the better bring the Graver to the Needle, and
in an Umformity of Strokes adapt the one to the other, and make them
harmonious: Whereas fome, relying too much on the Graver, ule it
here and there, in their flovenly Works, without any Difference, and
that, with incredible Carelessnets; fometimes cutting a Foreground,
Stone of Stem of 2 Tree, neat and smooth, which ought to be rough and
knobby; when at the fame time they are working a Face or marble Fi-
gare with the Needle. This mult be owing either to their Carelessnels,
or Defire of Eafe, or their ignorance; lince fuch Doings are againtt
Reaton and common Instruction.
I could mention many fuch diforderly Prints: Among others there's
one of the raifing of Lazarys, done by Berry, wheren the Figure of
Lazarus,

Lazaras, with to much of the Linney as comes about his Bodyf is
eich’d, and the reff of the Linnen, lying on the Ground, nearty en
groved; whereby one Part looks like Linnen, and the other like Silk.
The one is here and there sipp’d, and the other is not. But perhaps
the Plate was not well bit. It alfo fometimes happens, that we are
obliged to rub out Things, which makes good my Affertion; For, if the
Fault lie in the Plate, the Mafter ought, as much as poffible, to help
it by his Knowledge and Judgment. Could he handle the Graver,
why did he not thew it, and make Things agree ? And if he was not
Mafter of the Graver, why did he not better follow the Strokes of the
Needle? Had he, inflead of Cross harching, made the Strokes fomewhat
finer and criple harched them, and ufed some sipping, then it would have
been paftable
There is another Print with an Ornament round it, reprefenting a
Sacrifice of Flora, or the Spring, which is allo wreechedly erch’d and
engraved : Forthe foremolt Figures, as Charity, Piety and Time, and
every Thingelfe on the Fore-ground, are neatly finished and mofity en
graved; but the Figures on the fecend Ground to flight and poorty
:lcDld. as not to have any Agreement with the others; the Strokes
even look as if they were dabb’d on and drawn with a thaking Hand,
inflead of growing fainter every where, which would make the Work
neat and intire. This Arciff might have Known, that he could not
make the Graver and the Ncedle agree.
1am featible some will determipne, that many Things, fuch as Wa-

ter, Silver, Gold and such like smooth and shining Bodies, can be more
conveniently express’d with the Graver than the Needle: But, in my
Opinion, a skilful Hand can give every Thing it's Naruralness.
Tis. very Rrange to me, in the qld Prints, that the Mafters have
in nothing reprelented the natural Qualities, but eich’d every Thing after
one Manner, whether Wudities, Draperies, Air, Grounds of Stone; ex-
cept Water, and yet not this with thin and thick Strokes, but only
crots Parallels, and thofe very unlike, offentimes clole, and then wide,
as if they were fcratch’d. gain, they have not expresed any Colour;
and always made the Water dark and brown. Now, to create2 Difference
in sining Bodies, my Thoughts are, that you firft lay the Strokesiffrong
and parallel, and of areafonable Widch from each other, and thea clote
them by putting thinner between; 1 mean, in Water, black Marble,
polithed Steel, and fuch like; for by this Mechod we produce is

I it be asked, why in Eiching, the Strokes which are close and
thick fomdimes fy ap, tho' the Plact be in good Condition, and the
Ground netther burnt nor too hard : 1 antwer, that I have found by
Experience, that when the Water is too flrong, and at firff bires roo
tharp, we muft then take our Chance; becaute the Place, being cold,
cannot grow warm to foon as the Ground, which therefore is jorcibly
liffed from the Plate, and prefencly rifes; and the fooner, if the Strokesbe
clofe and thick; which happens not to cafily in the render Parts, where,
by the Thinness and Widch of the Strokes, the Water has not to much
Power to get underthem. To prevent this, the Water mult be some
what seeatened, and the Ground and Plate gradually made warm, in or-
der to make them unite with each other; especially in cold Weather:
For in the warm Months of Tune, Tuly and Auguft is not neceffary,
becaute we then ule harder. Grounds.
Now, to Know whether the Ground be in good Condition, I make a
Scratch of two, with a large Needle, in a (pare Place of the Place; and
if the Ground come out of the Strokes like Dubt, it is then roo bard,
but if in Curls, is in good Temper, especially if you can blow them off.
If they cansor be wiped off with a foff Feather, bur stick to the Cround,
is then foo foft. This is a nice Point. Ir fomerimes happened to me,
that here and there they remained in the Strokes.
Some Etchers allo frequeatly give themfelvesneedless Trouble, when
they pur our the Out-lines, which are made too frong on the light Side,
with Srop- ground, which, you know, alwaysllows more or lessover them,
especially if the Place be hor: But confider what Trouble they mutt
atterwards have, when the Our line is gone; for they are obliged to
renew with the Graver all the Strokes running againit it. Wherefore,
the beft Way is, to trace the Drawing nearly on the Place, and mark
at firfl, fofly with a fmall Point, the dark Touches, as thofe of the
Eyes, Nofeand Mourh, on the haded Side; yet nst os the Ligbt. But
to help them in slopping up their too frong Strokes, 1 shall.affign a
better Method than char of the Stop-ground.
Take thick-ground Wbite-lead thinnd with Oil of Turpentine, and
pread ir with a small Pencil over the Outline, to as jult to cover ir, and
no further: But be very careful not to do it over more than oce, leff you
take off the Ground; for the Oil afterwards evaporates; and in the
biting, you muld alfo not wipe over it with the Featber. This is an
tivension of a Friend of mine; and tho' 1 never experimented it, yt

C H A P. IX. Of the black Arr, or Merrotints.

4.] H O' no Figure of this Art is to be found in Cafar Ripa, as
having been unknown to him, yet fince, in our Times, thro'
its Foundation laid by Princes, and the Kind Affiltance of great Mes,
is arrived at to great Perfection, I hope the following Figure will
hot be unacceptable to the Profeffors and Lovers of it.
Figure of the black Art, or Merro-tinco.
Here you fee a young and plump Virgin, of a freth Complexion,
and amiable Countenance, drelsd in black Vetvet, lined and faced with
Sky-blae powdered with gold glittering Stars. She has a broad gold
Girdle embroidered with black Bats, which diminith towards the Arms.
Her Head attire is wanton and modiss, adorned here and there with
small Flowers. About her Neck is a gold Chain, to which hangs a
Medal, exhibiting a burning Alfar and thefe Words, MA GNR
BRIT ANNIE. in her right Hand is a small Tool like a Lan
cet, together with a Feather; and in the Left a Table, whereon is
painted an Head on a black Ground, reprefenting Nature. She poifes
airily on one Leg, as if the were dancing.
Explanation:
The Art is reprefented young and plump, to fignify that the is Kill
growing. The black Velvef Gown and Stars imply, that, like the Stars
the is lprung from dark Night. The golden Girdle and Bats give us
to underfland, that, tho' her Productions are not very lafing, yet
the makes great Gains. The Chain, with the Medal and Alrar there
on, proclaims her Lufre; and the Words round it allude to an Offer-
ing of Thanks to Great Britain, to whom the owes her Origin and Glors

to be derived from Black, yet Tis done in a quite different Manner;
for the former comes forth from the Light, and the latter from the
Shade; the one heightens, and the other shadows.
We have already faid, that Erching is, in fpeed, fuperior to En.
graving: But the Black Art is more expeditious than either of them;
and in Nearness has not it's Fellow; it may even compare with a
Painting, how foff and fivent foever, abaring for the Colours. Indeed
in Duration and Wear Tis the weakeff; but, on the other hand, its
Expedicioufnets brings in more Money.
This noble Art is preferable to any Engraving in reprefenting uncom-
ion Lights, as Candle, Torch, Lamp, Fire and the like: Wherefore
I think it does not improperly bear the Name of the Black Art. 7is
remarkable, nor to be of above fHry Vears flanding, and yet is arrived
at to great Perfection; tho' other Arts have required more Time. But
Englind, where the Climare is healthful and temperate, has contri-
Duted much to its Nearness and Luftre. There it had it's Birth and
Furtherame: For Prince Rupert gave us the firft Example. Wherefore
We may rightly sile it soble. The firft Print 1 faw of this Prince was
of an old Man’s Head, with a Cloth about it, taken, as far as I know,
from an Iilfur Painting. It was defigned to fine and great, and broad
handled, as if aathed with the Pencil by the bett Mafter: It even
looked, by Reafon of the natural Sofinels or Mcling, not to be lets
than Elack Art. The fame Prince alfo invented a certain Mctal bear
ing his Name, which it will recam for ever.
I doubr not but this Art will in Time become a delightful Diver.
tion to Painters, for three Realons. 1. For ir's Eafinets in Learning;
2. Forirs Nearnets; and, lattly, for it's Conveniency.
1. Tis cassty feurned, by any one who is accuftomed to draw on
grounded or blue Paper; becaute there is o Difference in Operation
berween the fcraping on the Plate and heightening on the grounded
Paper; beginning with the greatef Light and sparing the Shade; as we
have thewed in our Drawing book, rouching the Handling of Crajons
or Chalk-pencils., W herefore I affirm, that it comes nearer to a Painting
than Esching or Engraving. And tis. to eafily apprehended, I mean
in Theory, as to be learned in lets than three Days.)
2. Tis nest, and free from Soil and Smell; as not requiring either
2 Stop ground, Greate or Aqua-fortis.
Eafily, The Conveniency arifing from it may be eatily conjectured;
as is more expedicions than either Esching or Engraving..

But many are to eager in this Art to legrs seat Scraping, as to neg-
let the principal Part, the Ostline, which they often over run, and can-
not be brought right again; and when cerreff Defgs is wanting in 2
Plate or Print, what judicious Perfon will approve it? Indeed, we cannot
manage here as in Etching, (where the Our line may be traced on the
Plate with a Needle) For the Whire fometimes goes out, or is to faint
as fcarce to be feen; belides, its inconvenient to scrape Figures againft
a light Ground; tho' Artifts generally ule to work the Figure firft, and
then the Offskip against it. Now, to prevent this Inconvenience, firft
fcrape your Back-ground, and (pare the neat Out line; rather keeping
a little from it till the Figure be finithed : Afcerwards, you may gently
fcrape nearer. Thus you will not fo eafily run over the Outline, as
when you begin with the Figure.
There is a great Difference berween the Erching, Engraving and
Scraping of Painters and that of Engravers; for the former, making it
only their Divertion, do not finith Things to very highly as the latter
who have been brought up therein, and make it their conflant Bulinets
Painters are fatisfied with thewing only good Defign and general De-
corum; becaute, while they were neatly to finith one Place, they can
work another.
This Art is certainly ealy to a Perfon of good Knowledge Butif
the Work be not light enough at firft, go over it a second Time. indeed
you muft not think to finith up atonce, becaute, rill a Proof be taken,
you cannot poffibly know what Condition your Plate is in. Do like
the Painters, firft to dead colour with bread Parts and then prip. Now,
having a Proof, you can give the Work it's main Heightening, and thus
with Patience finith every Part; a Point requiring neither much Time
nor Study, but a little Obfervation., There is publifhed a Print of a
little Satyr, which in an Hour's Time I fcraped loofein my Hand, as
I walked in a Garden; and, after a Proof taken, finithed in another
Hour. Few learn this Art, becaute, as Ithink, they cannot be perfuaded i
how eafy it is, and with what few Circumflances actended: But should
the Lovers fet about it,, we may poffibly in Time fee it become too.

peculiar to the Black Art, fuch as Festrairs, Night and Candle-pieces,
Spectres and Inchantments, Apparitions, Flowers, Fruits, Silver, Gold,
China-ware, Cryfal, Arms and Herbs. Who will be able to erch or
engrave thofe Things to perfell and natural as they can be fcraped?
