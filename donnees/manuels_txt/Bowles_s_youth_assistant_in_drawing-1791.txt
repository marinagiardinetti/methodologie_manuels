therewith, is even neceffary to form the minds of Vouth for
whatever ftation defigned, fince nothing informs of corrects
our ideas fo foon as a true knowledge of Symmetry and Pro-
portion. Although this Art in its extent be as pacious as
Obfervation can difcover, or Imagination conceive, yet in
the fellowing sheets may be found an abstract, containing
Examples amply fufficient to direct a Genius in the leaft apt
or inquifitive, not forgetting diligence, but layingafide fear;
becaute every freth attempt on the same subject will evidence
an amendment to encourage the learner. It would be rath on
a fudden to expect perfection in this Art; yet after a few
painful Essays, a pleafure fucceeds in the prospect, and
grows in the practice beyond that of any other Acquifition;
and fure no one would (pare the Means where the End is fo
defirable. Not one Book has hitherto appeared in this coun-
try well faited to facilitate the attainment of this Art; yet
we are always invited to attend to ample and learned in-
structions to beginners, where the preliminary difcourfes
often puzzle and confufe the ideas more than the examples.

making a perfect out-line, for in this principally confifts the
Art of Drawing; this fully attained, all Arts are eafy, and

every Rudy will become delightful., The out-line compleat-

Tabour fo pleafing; that no commendation can; be given ade-


quare to the pleafure a real profeffor finds in thre execution of
this Rirt; or rather Science facceeding rt. Beginners are
apt to leave the ftudy of out-lines too foon, and fo commence
painters; like thofe who raife a structure ere the foundation
be compleased. Light and Shadow are produced by Erching
or Hatching, Washing, Chiaro Oscure; Painting, Modelling,
Scutpoure, Sc. 5c. As the firft three are chrefly ufed by
learners, I shall give a few hints for the executing each.
And firft of Hatching: carefully-observe the Burin, of
manner in which the ftrokes of the original are laid, and
keep with exactnets the form, not fo much regarding their

number; firft Hightly making them all of a thicknets, and
after by various retouchings ftrengthen them to the tone of
colour in youroriginal, whether yeu ufe black or red chalk,
or black lead; which may be afed fingly or thus compound=
ed, working the fainter parts with black; lead, and gives

frength with black chalk: os finithing your drapery, hair
and exc-brows in this manner, and the ffeth or naked with



red chalk. This method is beft for copying engraved prints,
in
which I principally recommend to beginners.
Next of Wathingor Shading with Indian Ink. Goexactly
over your out-line with a gen dipped in common Ink, with
clean stale bread or India rubber, rub out all remains of
your black lead; then mix your Indian Ink, by rubbing it
in an earthen faucer with water, till it is pretty black; then
take another clean faucer and dip your pencil in the Indian
Ink, and with water mix it to the lighteft fhade; as it dries
deepen it where necelfary, till you come up to the ftrength of
your original. This method is moft proper to ufe in draw-
ing from mezzotintos or paintings.
Eaftly- of Crayons, beginning with black and white: take
blue or purple-coloured paper, and having exactly formed
your out-line, begin on the second degree of your fhades,
and with black chalk darken downwards; then take white
French chalk, to be found at all colour-(hops, and heighten
the lighter parts to a perfect white. In this manner all

paintings may be copied in their proper colours, by having
f
disterent Crayons of each colour, from dark to light in due
gradations; and practifing by the preceding rule, rolling a
piece of paper to a point, and dozzelingor rubbing each co-
four on the paper when finifhed, to prevent their coming off,
which yet will betender, and should be kept behind a glats.
